I was on the beach this weekend on a sunny day, and the air was still freezing. The local clam shack and ice cream stand had opened but the people in line were wearing windbreakers; this year's scoop girls are only just starting to build the biceps that they'll take to school next fall.It doesn't get hot enough in Portland, Oregon for music like this, and maybe that's why Chad Crouch and Blanket Music recorded Move in the South Pacific, on balmy Island 734-001 of the Bikini Atoll. They're joined by the beautiful voices of Esperanza Spalding (of Noise for Pretend) and Corrina Repp, who sound as smooth as ice against a hot torso. ""Shut up and sway your hips,"" they implore, and the tropical songs and warm recording couldn't sound more like an afternoon at a bar by the beach. They even put a cocktail umbrella in the spine of the disc, to illustrate what you're missing.Crouch says this is party music, and it is, though it's also good hangover music: soothing and free of shrill noise. The hooks are so subtle and laid-back that it can take a few listens to appreciate Crouch's catchy songwriting-- most notably on ""K - A - R - A [breathless] O - K [keep it coming] EEEeeeeeeeee,"" where his droopy-dog vocals and clever lyrics dance over a catchy guitar riff. Greg Lind's drumming is limber but restrained, and even the drum machine that augments the music is nicely integrated-- as on the hot jazz-meets-IDM ""Itchy Popcorn,"" which builds to speaker-shaking bass. Crouch is a low-key frontman with a thin, melodic voice, perfect for the tone of this record, and he and Ross Seligman play killer staccato lines on guitar.I'd expect American bossa nova to be as bad as other Americanized ethnic creations, like American ska, or American chop suey. In addition to having a stand-up band, Crouch succeeds by not pretending to be anything he isn't-- instead of posing as a smooth island loverboy, he sticks to wry lyrics and mundane topics. He has three jobs: as a musician, as a designer, and as the head of this label; and he likes to talk about the need to slow down. Like the 'to do' list that's set to a beautiful tune on ""Walk the Dog,"" or his potshots at hip visual artists in ""Hot Designers."" He writes witty love songs about (though not necessarily to) his ""incredible"" girlfriend, who he describes so sweetly in the liner notes that I winced hoping they haven't broken up since this came out. For example, the cutesy interplay in ""Tap the Beat"" (He: ""And if I lost my legs..."" She: ""I would put you on my back/ And I would grab things off the shelf for you""). Hey, guys, get a room!On a song like ""Costa Del Sol"" there's genuine yearning in Crouch's voice, the note of sincerity that makes it compelling and not just exotic. What does he yearn for? Maybe his girlfriend, though she probably hangs around plenty; maybe something as global as world peace, as on ""Get Togetha."" But more than anything, it sounds like Crouch wanted to vacation in a warm place and to party. And on the defrosting boardwalks, in the last gusts of New England's waning chill, that's good enough for me."

The song jumped and wriggled and moved like nothing else on the radio: a huge, loose-limbed, roiling, sweaty, berserk drum break, greasy guitars stabs exploding like fireworks. Rich Harrison, who produced Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love"", made the track, and it has the same sense of dizzy sunkissed freedom. But its greatest asset is the voice that cut through the drums like a sword, yelping and gasping and screaming for joy.""1 Thing"" is the first track on R&B; singer Amerie Rogers' sophomore album Touch, and the album never again reaches the giddy heights of that song. It never could. ""1 Thing"" is all sweat and teeth and adrenaline. After that opening salvo, Rogers slowly settles into the pillowy, luxurious tracks that Harrison creates for her. Harrison's production has an organic core. He spent his formative years working in D.C. go-go, and his compositions have that loose-limbed swagger, relying heavily on sampled horn screams and weeping electric pianos. But his work never sounds like a throwback; his tracks all have a glossy, processed sheen.Amerie may be the perfect collaborator for Harrison's combination of Stax grit and Neptunes shine. Rogers has one of those thin, reedy voices popular on the radio right now; another producer would probably turn her into a sound effect, the way Lil Jon did with Ciara on ""Goodies"". But she has an urbane sophistication that sets her apart from the likes of Ashanti and Nivea; her precise jazz phrasing is the only saving grace on the mawkish ballad ""Just Like Me"". And when she has to, she brings out a fiery emotional center; on the breakup stomper ""Rolling Down My Face"", she squeezes across the song's tricky mix of regret and determination. Midway through the album, Rogers and Harrison come together perfectly for the second time on ""Talkin' About"", an impossibly catchy midtempo howler with a shifty drum track and the sort of glorious chorus hook that'll worm its way right into your brain. These two know each other well.Harrison produced eight of the 13 tracks on Touch, and too many of the other producers' tracks don't fit into his lush tapestry. Rogers can't do anything with Bryce Wilson's squelchy Neptunes keyboards on ""Not the Only One"". But Rogers brings her personality to tracks that wouldn't have worked otherwise. When Lil Jon shows up for the obligatory club track (the title track here), Rogers' frisky, coy vocal and a nimble little conga bit turn an otherwise leaden, paint-by-numbers crunk&b; track into a sexy little experiment with Latin freestyle. It may not be ""1 Thing"", but it'll do."

Ugh. To Keery’s credit, making music is more than a passing vanity project; before he found life-altering fame playing Steve Harrington, the reformed bad boy of Stranger Things, he played guitar in the Chicago psych-rock band Post Animal. Over the last few years, in between roles as a murderous rideshare driver and a beleagured video game designer, he’s been kicking around a solo synth-pop project called Djo. As suggested by the moniker, which is pronounced like his first name, it’s still him—but with a wink.Djo’s vibes-forward second album, Decide, conceals its anxieties about change and identity beneath an onslaught of synthesizers and Auto-Tune, often in the interest of fun but occasionally to its detriment. Written and produced alongside Adam Thein, Decide takes full advantage of studio wizardry. Opener “Runner” begins with a series of borderline 8-bit bleeps as Keery commits to growth—“People never change/But I have to try”—delivered in a crystal-clear falsetto. Soon enough, the song transitions into a slicker, chromatic sound, all vocodered vocals and savvy electronica that wraps up with a strangled shout. Sometimes, the full-bodied pastiche can’t hide some clunky lyricism. “I know my hair looked good in the bathroom at the bar/Turns out I left my wallet at the bathroom bar” goes one such line on the Talking Heads-esque “Gloom.” An exploration of the pitfalls of ego—and potentially good-natured jab at his own famous mane—it’s a charming attempt at nodding to his audience, even if his songwriting isn't quite up for the challenge.It is ironic, then, that the best tracks on Decide tend to be the longer ones, when Keery’s instrumental impulses are allowed to spiral in unexpected directions (those psych rock roots die hard). While agonizing over the grip of social media, “Half Life” toggles between ominous stillness and bursts of sparkly brightness in a manner that evokes a dopamine loop. “On and On,” a song about doomscrolling, coasts along on a throbby wobble before skyrocketing into an arena rock-sized percussion breakdown.Decide is a fun, off-kilter synth-pop album that proves Keery’s talent, but by its conclusion, a clearer picture of its maker fails to emerge. (One lovely exception is “End of Beginning” with its lyrics about returning to Chicago and reconnecting with a past version of himself.) As on his debut TWENTY TWENTY, Djo proudly reps influences like Daft Punk and Tame Impala, borrowing their tricks without adding much in the way of innovation. Still, the lack of personal revelations is forgivable: Keery has explicitly said that he hoped the Djo persona—he sports a ’70s bowl cut wig onstage and in promo pics—would help distance himself from his onscreen roles. There is something tragic about an album preoccupied with the fakeries of technology made by someone whose fans have as largely formed a relationship with him through the screen. But with Djo, he is finding his way through the simulation."

While you can no longer barter your soul to Beelzebub for guitar-picking prowess, The Man will gladly exchange your eternal being for a place on the fryer and a hairnet. Or one may just opt for the Sweet Biscuit Crunchers and some Purple Pepper Sauce for a dollar. The tragicomic irony of a fast food joint squatting on the Valhalla of Delta Blues out-tarnishes our collective lore more than the Bus Stop of Gethsemane and adjoining Mount of Olives Hotel. And when you toss one of those sugary Sweet Biscuit Crunchers or gooey Honey-Butter Biscuits into your fat maw, you can let your mind drift to the thinly veiled sexual euphemisms of the blues, where biscuit almost certainly means ""vagina.""The Blues had been raped, exploited, stolen, diluted, rediscovered, reforgotten, and rendered meaningless countless times long before the Russian Mafia kept hot on the heels of the Blues Brothers 2000 and the House of Blues primarily showcased Wu-Tang side projects and Godsmack. Now, nearly a century after its birth, a non-ironic, post-Jon Spencer form of the Blues has risen again, ever so stubbornly and somnolently-- and naturally, it's being led by a couple of white kids. Jack White ahem not only namedrops Robert Johnson, he covers him. Summons him. Wears the same little derby as him. And on ""Ball and Biscuit"", the album-stretching stomper of the White Stripes' fourth album, White moans, ""Let's have a ball and a biscuit, sugar."" It's all too plainly clear what he means.What's less clear on the track (and the rest of Elephant), however, is just what Jack White intends. Certainly, one of his goals is to simply Rock, which his shit-hot guitar solos do bombastically; those Sears-Roebucks pickups buzz and screech like atomic harmonicas on the album's best songs. But beyond this, White struggles to tenuously weld a growing amalgam of contradictions and genre experiments with a veneer of schtick, persona and Fonzie cool, while Meg's pancake-handed drumming drips solvent over the whole experiment.The problem is that Jack White aims to honor his diverse heroes with too limited a palette; it's like paying tribute to Edward Hopper, Ansel Adams, Robert Colescott, and Georgia O'Keeffe in mural with a foot-pump-operated Wagner Power Painter and buckets of red and white. ""Hypnotize"" valiantly strives for The Stooges, while ""Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine"" gives up four fingers to a butcher's knife on the altar of Led Zeppelin. But Jack White is no Jim Page (nor Osterberg), and suggestions to the contrary will earn you an explanation at the end of the Questionable Musical Taste line on judgment day. Meg White, meanwhile, pleads to her man on ""In the Cold, Cold Night"" like a coy Mo Tucker or Georgia Hubley-- more so than take-no-sass Patsy Cline or Dusty in Memphis. Linty in Arkadelphia, perhaps."

A fresh-faced, 25-year-old Axl Rose, so country that he’s got a long stalk of wheat between his teeth, gets off a bus and enters a landscape that screams “bad side of town”; neon lights flash darkly, a shady guy perched on the corner approaches him, black-stockinged legs catch Axl’s eye. Cut to a similarly dank club where, with the aid of Aqua Net, Axl and the rest of Guns N’ Roses are barreling through the track, while TVs flicker into A Clockwork Orange-style fantasia about the bad news lurking all around.The electric opening notes, played with sputtering enthusiasm by lead guitarist Slash, only hint at the terror that’s coming; Axl’s under-his-breath “Oh my god” cranks up the tension; and then, aided by Steven Adler’s lightly swinging drums and backing vocals that recall a demon choir, the full horror is exposed—a world where every vice is for sale depending on your mood for indulgence and your tolerance for sin. The chugging breakdown, which culminates in Axl’s shrieked “You know where you are? You’re in the jungle, baby! You’re gonna diiiieeeeeaagghghhhhhghghghgh,” is “Tubular Bells” through a Marshall stack, a horror movie in miniature for anyone who thought the rock’n’roll lifestyle was all fun and games.Amid the bumper crop of records from ’80s bands who graduated from Sunset Strip clubs to MTV’s newly minted  “Headbangers Ball”—the self-titled debuts from glam brats Faster Pussycat and biker-bloozers L.A. Guns—Appetite stood out for how absolutely harsh it got, its chronicles of the wild life in Los Angeles plainly stated by the lye-voiced Axl while his bandmates bobbed and thrashed. The Los Angeles portrayed on Appetite inverts the ideal of Randy Newman’s ever-lovable metropolis, turning it into a place where the then-in-vogue term “drug war” meant fighting with the spectre of heroin (aka “Mr. Brownstone”), where trickle-down economics meant buying cheap hooch on the last scraps of credit, and where paranoid fantasies were always justified. Women were beautiful and you could even put the ones with less utility in their place every so often. It was the jungle, baby, and you were gonna die.Appetite for Destruction didn’t only stand out because of its storm of bad vibes, although that sure helped. The band’s stew of influences—caustic punk, sinewy funk, Aerosmith, the Stones—helped make it a switchblade-sharp statement of intent. “In the last year, I’ve spent over $1,300 on cassettes, everything from Slayer to Wham! to listen to production, vocals, melodies, this and that,” Axl told the UK music magazine Sounds in 1987, and while Mike Clink’s economical production doesn’t have the gloss of Wham!’s Make It Big, studying influences beyond the glammed-up bills at the Troubadour  played a large part in the band’s sound."

His father had just died of cancer, and in Rodeo, Calif., a smallish East Bay suburb next to an oil refinery, Armstrong retreated into MTV, the Beatles, Van Halen, and a Stratocaster knock-off he nicknamed Blue. He grew close to schoolmate Michael Pritchard, who had his own family grief and who introduced Armstrong to British heavy metal giants like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Pritchard later earned the sobriquet Mike Dirnt, for his constant dirnting on bass guitar.In high school, Armstrong and Dirnt smoked pot and played in a band called Sweet Children, finding their tribe in a tiny clique of DIY punks. By 1988, Sweet Children had their first gig at 924 Gilman Street, the Berkeley punk mecca opened the previous year by Maximumrocknroll zine founder Tim Yohannan, and Armstrong told his waitress mother he wouldn’t be graduating. Sweet Children signed to Lookout Records!, changed their name to Green Day, and put out a pair of rough but promising EPs. They brought in Frank “Tré Cool” Wright, a drummer known equally for his musicianship and his mischievousness, and with their sharply improved LP Kerplunk!, Green Day arrived.As Kerplunk! landed on shelves in December 1991, Nirvana’s Nevermind zoomed to the top of the album charts. A band with Green Day’s momentum and punk pedigree was obvious bait for the major labels. Still, it was Armstrong’s voice, sneering and congested, that initially put one A&R exec off of Green Day’s demo. Luckily, he passed it to his producing partner, Rob Cavallo, whose father had been Prince’s manager circa Purple Rain and who, despite signing respected L.A. pop-punks the Muffs, was sorely in need of a hit.He found one. Co-produced by Cavallo and the band themselves, Green Day’s Dookie was released on February 1, 1994. To date, the band’s Warner/Reprise debut has sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. Most of those album buyers probably know nothing about its makers’ humble origins. But that story helps to explain the unique series of balances, between showmanship and disaffection, dogmatic punk ideals and romantic stadium dreams, sweetness and scatology, partying and pain, that have turned Dookie into one of the greatest teenage wasteland albums of any generation. Armstrong’s Dookie guitar? His childhood’s trusty old Blue."

Today, we revisit the classic rock staple from a band who rebounded from tragedy to record one of the biggest albums ever made.","For many bands, the sudden and horrific death of their lead singer at the peak of their popularity would be a career-ender. AC/DC took a few weeks to regroup and then recorded one of the biggest albums of all time.Back in Black is claimed in equal measure by the jocks, the stoners, the nerds, the delinquents, and the teachers. Nashville studios used it to test their acoustics. The title track boasts nothing less than one of the most gloriously elemental riffs ever devised—the perfection of the form, the ne plus ultra of jock jams, destined to be clumsily chunked out for eternity by teens testing fuzz pedals in God’s own Guitar Center. It might not necessarily be AC/DC’s best—if their career can even be measured in units of particular albums rather than one long, loud, continuous mid-tempo guitar riff spanning five decades. But it is their most album—most accessible, most successful, most enduring, most emblematic, and, given its genesis, most unlikely.In 1979, AC/DC had made the leap from workingman Australian hard-rock band, opening arena tours for the likes of Cheap Trick and UFO, to bona fide headliners in their own right. Highway to Hell—their seventh album in five years—had gone platinum in the U.S., thanks in large part to producer Robert John “Mutt” Lange, whose kitchen-sink ethos would define the sound of rock radio for the next decade. (Previous AC/DC albums had been produced by the legendary Australian songwriting duo of Harry Vanda and George Young, the latter of whom happened to also be the older brother of AC/DC guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young.) The success of the album cemented the image of the band as libidinous but harmless dirtbags, perfecting carnal anthems tuneful enough to attract normies seeking an edge and heavy enough to keep the metal faithful in line. Angus was as much mascot as musical director, a perpetual motion machine decked out in a schoolboy uniform, but ultimately less threatening than an actual teenager.Though not necessarily the band’s focal point, their lead singer was 33-year-old Bon Scott, a hard-partying, Scottish-born, impossible-voiced dynamo for whom the word impish was invented. He died alone in the passenger seat of a car on a freezing February night in London in 1980 following a night of drinking, having asphyxiated on his own vomit; authorities ruled it “death by misadventure.” The Young brothers retreated doing the only thing they knew how—coming up with shitloads of guitar riffs—then kicked off a search for Scott’s replacement in earnest almost immediately."

It was the breakthrough success for the three artists who spearheaded it, but it built on a series of low-budget and bedroom projects-- like rappers Why? and Doseone's Greenthink project, Dose's murmuring Slowdeath, or producer and DJ Odd Nosdam's Plan 9: Meat Your Hypnotist-- where obtuse verses spilled out like ripped-up paper scraps over hazy, droning vinyl, overheard conversations or snippets from TV, on CDs that were fragmented into at least forty tracks apiece.The cLOUDDEAD project extended those methods; sharp humor and surreal images leavened the album's odd shapelessness, and the band even managed to eke out a few cogent concert pieces for their tour. But the way they stitched the record together was even more interesting: The songs run together at the drop of an attention span, and the band combined them as intuitively as a found sound artist creating order out of tossed-off materials. It had an unfinished feel fed by the two years that they worked on it, at dorms and parents' houses, and even through their relocation from Cincinnati to the Bay Area. It was an album about a process, not an outcome.The cLOUDDEAD record hit, as much as records like that ever do, and the Anticon collective-- of which Why?, Doseone and Odd Nosdam are founding members-- made waves beyond the underground hip-hop community with which it feuded. (And to be clear once again, the group never claimed this project was ""hip-hop,"" although the controversy from purists has done nothing but make people think harder about their work.) So as they finally release their follow-up, Ten, we know more about the artists, and they've grown more into their styles.You can identify the two frontmen at the start of ""Pop Song"": Why?'s the one gently singing, ""Elvis, what happened?"" while Dose chants, ""The wooden man and his splintering self."" Why?'s excellent Oaklandazulasylum revealed a rap-based artist who wants to write songs and strum a guitar, making him one of very few artists trying to cross over from hip-hop to indie rock. Doseone has worked with producer Jel under the name Themselves, and he also came into his own as a performer on his album with Circle, where partner Boom Bip's production challenged the sometimes self-absorbed intricacies of his lyrics.Completing the trio is Odd Nosdam, who produced half the tracks (Why? handled the rest) and played electronic drums. Nosdam demonstrates his deft taste in ambient vinyl and oompah beats, with a couple kitschy samples mixed in; on his tracks, the most static sounds can buzz and excite-- like the smoggy ""Rifle Eyes"", where the crackling noise seems to come from something more sinister than just old vinyl."

Today we revisit a 1980s rock blockbuster: the bold, brilliant, and misunderstood apex of Bruce Springsteen’s imperial era.","As the release of Born in the U.S.A. approached in spring 1984—and with it, one of the greatest commercial ascents in the history of popular music—Bruce Springsteen was feeling apprehensive. It wasn’t because of “Dancing in the Dark,” which he added last-minute after his manager convinced him to write one more surefire attempt at a hit. It wasn’t because of the title track, a booming anthem whose chorus could be misinterpreted as a rallying cry for Reagan-era jingoism. And it wasn’t because of the cover art, a photograph by Annie Leibovitz that could be mistaken for a man urinating on an American flag. It was because of a song called “No Surrender,” and, in particular, its final verse:Now on the street tonight the lights grow dimThe walls of my room are closing inThere’s a war outside still ragingYou say it ain’t ours anymore to winI want to sleep beneath peaceful skies in my lover’s bedWith a wide open country in my eyesAnd these romantic dreams in my headSomething felt off as he sang these words. Who could be so blindly optimistic? During the tour for Born in the U.S.A., which spanned 16 months and brought the E Street Band to the biggest audiences they had ever played, Springsteen tried retooling the driving arrangement as a tender acoustic ballad; he rewrote the verse and changed his delivery. By the end of the run, it only appeared sporadically in setlists. “It was a song I was uncomfortable with,” he wrote years later. “You don’t hold out and triumph all the time in life. You compromise, you suffer defeat; you slip into life’s gray areas.”So how did it wind up on the album? It wasn’t for a lack of material. Most casual fans know that as Springsteen was in the process of piecing together this full-band masterpiece, he first recorded an entirely different one: 1982’s solo acoustic Nebraska, originally intended as demos for the follow-up to 1980’s The River. But there was more where that came from. Before he landed on the dozen songs that would comprise his bestselling album, Springsteen continued down Nebraska’s folky path with story-song outtakes like “Shut Out the Light”; he worked with the band on epics like “This Hard Land” and straight-ahead rockers like “Murder Incorporated.” He wrote a goofy song about having his story told in a TV movie and a strange, apocalyptic one about the KKK. He is estimated to have recorded somewhere between 50 and 100 songs, hoping to amass enough material for one cohesive record."

You know, where the album has a pleasing ramshackle feel under the surface-level skillfulness, the sense that the vocal acrobatics or tricky instrumental interplay could suddenly veer into uncomfortable, mock amateurish expressionism.By contrast, you never get the sense that Muse are anything less than in total control of their ""difficult"" music at all times. Throughout The Resistance, frontman Matt Bellamy is ready and willing to foreground his chops, be it tickling the ivories, hopping octaves, or tossing out increasingly tasteful solos. If the The Resistance is ""about"" anything, aside from the conceptual malarkey encoded in the lyrics, it's about mastery, ego-security, etc. It's the kind of all-caps, no half-stepping ART-ROCK that closes with a three-part mini-epic so shameless about its own classic rock bigness that it's billed as a ""Symphony"", complete with ""Overture"". Jumped ship yet?For the wary or outright dismissive, however, The Resistance is also a very smartly sequenced album. it opens with the most ""pop"" sequence of the band's career, a three-song sequence aping the stadium-grade synth-rock of Depeche Mode at their crossover height. It then segues into a middle section of hard (but not too hard) rock, nodding in the direction of grottier bands like Queens of the Stone Age or System of a Down without stripping away the sparkle. Only then does The Resistance shift into the sort of fist-pumping, kitchen-sink prog you were probably expecting. It's canny: Leading the uncommitted down a drum machine paved path of catchy 1980s revivalism and straight into the path of an army of kids straddling the gap between entry-level classical and ""Headbanger's Ball"".And ""army"" is right: Unity in the face of faceless post-industrial society grinding down beautiful stuff like love and friendship is perhaps Muse's great theme. Bellamy is constantly tossing out mass-shout-along-ready lyrics like ""we will be victorious"" and ""they won't stop breaking us down."" Songs get titles like ""Uprising"" and (natch) ""Resistance"". Things break down easily into a ""we"" (rarely does an ""I"" creep into Bellamy's songwriting) and a ""they."" Your age-old, rock-standard good (we, the fans) vs. evil (them, the nebulous straight government-corporate nexus) set-up, got it?But unlike the creepy mass-rally overtones that so bugged early rock critics about music designed to pack civic centers-- or thrilled them when it was punk leading in the kids in revolt-- you get the sense that Bellamy's lyrics are an outgrowth of wanting to make his music as big and inclusive as possible, rather than any inchoate political impulses. No doubt Bellamy fancies himself some sort of social crusader, but his mush-headed vagueness (like Bono and Chris Martin and just about any Brit frontman operating on this scale) is designed to inspire warm fuzzy feelings of togetherness and resistance rather than offer any ten-point plan to overthrow the emotionally fascist modern world."

They aren't inept, amateurish or even exactly boring, but their parlor music takes a slow and emotionally neutral path that almost fights against engagement.The typical Town and Country piece moves as painfully as old people crossing the street. If you can't settle into it, you get frustrated thinking of all the things they don't do: they don't have the apocalyptic drama of the Constellation Records bands (e.g., Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think, Set Fire to Flames), and they also steer clear of the sentimental heartstring-tugs and old-sepia-toned filmstrips of, say, Rachel's. Their long tones lack the primitive clarity of deep-listening music, and the arrangements pick up the subtlety and repetition of the minimalist composition, but they skip the rigor-- and rigidity-- of the academy for something more natural and less satisfying. To say they evoke Feldman, Reich or Messiaen is like saying the long-haired kid down the hall ""sounds like"" Jimi Hendrix.If nothing else, the album is beautiful. The arrangements may sound like staid chamber music, but the fact that it's the same four people swapping off between these instruments-- horns here, strings there, harmonium, guitar and some unrecognizable whistles or percussion-- gives the album some vigor. And you'll get plenty of time to contemplate the timbres of every instrument they use, because the pace is mostly laborious. ""Aubergine"" and ""Old Fashioned"" follow an introduction/tension/resolution arc, but the melodies roll out so, damn, slowly that the tracks feel too long even at five or ten minutes (respectively). When ""Lifestyled"" bursts in with a rattling, whistling flurry of action, it might finally grab your attention, but only for about half a minute, after which it settles into a shallow, meandering arrangement.But some of the album's other moments offer a more engaging approach. The opening track, ""Sleeping in the Midday Sun"", opens with sustained tones on strings and a horn, intense enough to leave a dent in your forehead before it segue to trance-like percussion led by a triangle. On ""Nonstop Dancer"", what could have been another rote stretch of ambling, by-numbers post-rock finds a center of gravity in long, droning sounds. And pulsing rhythms drive ""Shirtless"" into shifting patterns of percussion, sparking the record's most spontaneous playing.Though Town and Country are far from the first band to take this path, the drones and hypnotic percussion fit their mission: they're naturalistic, evenly paced, and not distractingly complicated. Instead of lulling you into simplicity, they excite you with it, focusing you into the buzzing center of their music. While there are plenty of bands doing better work with the same materials, Town and Country sound so committed in these moments-- so elated by what they're doing-- that you actually forget to want more from them."

Considering how record companies love to sell you the same album multiple times, that's a bizarrely long tenure for the newest music industry-approved technology. Because the CD refuses to yield the throne to any other physical formats (DVDs? Minidiscs?), labels have long been forced to find other ways to repeatedly plunder their catalogs, most notably by releasing remastered and expanded versions of any album that was reasonably successful. In some cases, the cleaned-up sound and snazzier packaging of these records corrects lazy, negligent editions released in the CD's early days, but more often it's just a case of shaking loose change out of the couch cushions.That's not the case with Electric Light Orchestra, subjects of a lengthy restoration project that has reached Out of the Blue in time for its 30th anniversary. ELO may not immediately seem like an essential part of music history, but there's no denying they're a band well served by the fancy frills that accompany a reissue. For starters, ELO records hearken back to an era where album art meant Awesome Fucking Spaceships, and Out of the Blue has an especially fine one that resembles a cross between a jukebox and the old Simon games. It's a disservice to shrink such a cover down to CD-size packaging, but the reissue compensates by including a build-it-yourself punch-out space needle thingy and pictures of the band's ridiculous spaceship stage-set.More importantly, ELO records respond well to remastered sound, due to the band's entire aesthetic being based upon Jeff Lynne using approximately 250 tracks of instruments and vocals in every song. Out of the Blue is often thought to be the band's high water mark because, in many ways, it was the culmination of Lynne's ambitious original mission to blend rock'n'roll with orchestral flourishes, his presumptuous effort to ""pick up where the Beatles left off."" By this, his seventh album, Lynne had developed the idea far beyond the cheesy primordial mashups like his ""Roll Over Beethoven"" cover (excepting the silly throwback ""Birmingham Blues""), and had even reached past the increasingly restrictive borders of 70s rock to embrace treble-heavy elements of the rising disco sound like liberal uses of falsetto, arcade synths, and melodramatic strings.Prophetic anticipation or dumb luck, Out of the Blue hit the zeitgeist jackpot in 1977, coming out within a month of Saturday Night Fever and reflecting, if not true disco, a perfect crossover gateway-drug to piggyback on the explosion of their fellow rock defectors, the Bee Gees. Though ELO's finest singles may have appeared on the two prior albums (can you argue with ""Evil Woman"" or ""Livin' Thing""?), Out of the Blue has its share of greatest hits regulars sprinkled across its four vinyl sides: ""Turn to Stone"", ""Sweet Talkin' Woman"", ""Wild West Hero"". The side C four-song suite ""Concerto for a Rainy Day"" (god bless the 70s) even includes the triumphant ""Mr. Blue Sky"", deservedly exhumed in the past few years by the hipster cognoscenti as a perfectly weird slice of gaudy, over-the-top FM-dial pop."

Today, we revisit the classic rock staple from a band who rebounded from tragedy to record one of the biggest albums ever made.","For many bands, the sudden and horrific death of their lead singer at the peak of their popularity would be a career-ender. AC/DC took a few weeks to regroup and then recorded one of the biggest albums of all time.Back in Black is claimed in equal measure by the jocks, the stoners, the nerds, the delinquents, and the teachers. Nashville studios used it to test their acoustics. The title track boasts nothing less than one of the most gloriously elemental riffs ever devised—the perfection of the form, the ne plus ultra of jock jams, destined to be clumsily chunked out for eternity by teens testing fuzz pedals in God’s own Guitar Center. It might not necessarily be AC/DC’s best—if their career can even be measured in units of particular albums rather than one long, loud, continuous mid-tempo guitar riff spanning five decades. But it is their most album—most accessible, most successful, most enduring, most emblematic, and, given its genesis, most unlikely.In 1979, AC/DC had made the leap from workingman Australian hard-rock band, opening arena tours for the likes of Cheap Trick and UFO, to bona fide headliners in their own right. Highway to Hell—their seventh album in five years—had gone platinum in the U.S., thanks in large part to producer Robert John “Mutt” Lange, whose kitchen-sink ethos would define the sound of rock radio for the next decade. (Previous AC/DC albums had been produced by the legendary Australian songwriting duo of Harry Vanda and George Young, the latter of whom happened to also be the older brother of AC/DC guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young.) The success of the album cemented the image of the band as libidinous but harmless dirtbags, perfecting carnal anthems tuneful enough to attract normies seeking an edge and heavy enough to keep the metal faithful in line. Angus was as much mascot as musical director, a perpetual motion machine decked out in a schoolboy uniform, but ultimately less threatening than an actual teenager.Though not necessarily the band’s focal point, their lead singer was 33-year-old Bon Scott, a hard-partying, Scottish-born, impossible-voiced dynamo for whom the word impish was invented. He died alone in the passenger seat of a car on a freezing February night in London in 1980 following a night of drinking, having asphyxiated on his own vomit; authorities ruled it “death by misadventure.” The Young brothers retreated doing the only thing they knew how—coming up with shitloads of guitar riffs—then kicked off a search for Scott’s replacement in earnest almost immediately."

Now, it's no secret that, when it comes to rock's metal edge, these Queens want badly to be kings; you need look no further for proof than 2000's blistering, thuggish Rated R, on which frontman Josh Homme's searing guitars and theatrical vocals brought the band close enough to their goal to sniff the fleurs de lis. That, however, is history, and with Songs for the Deaf, the Queens have hit a new peak in their development: the sound is more massive, the chaos is more calculated, and with hired gun Dave Grohl at the kit, the band has an unprecedented drive that leaves them poised for their strongest bid for power yet.""You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire"" embodies the greatest strengths of rock at its hardest-- stunning riffs, breakneck speed, and guitars that churn and spit like a threshing machine. It's riddled with decades-old metal cliches, but the Queens know what their audience expects, and they use this knowledge to continually twist rock stereotypes into a vicious full-nelson until they beg for mercy. It's fantastic, and this is just the first track.""No One Knows"" changes Songs for the Deaf's pace by sliding into an easy groove, sleazing its way across a dimly-lit bar, half-drunk and reeking of cheap cologne, to put the moves on your girlfriend (or, you know, you, depending). This is four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality, folks, and it's the second installment in this album's triad of genius, completed subsequently by the next track, ""First It Giveth"". ""Giveth"" brings the drama like a champ, with Homme singing in pained falsetto over punishing riffs during the verses, and opening up into aggro-overdrive for the appropriately apocalyptic chorus.But along the path to greatness, there are pitfalls, and one Homme often falls into here is the old ""chamber of lost souls"" effect (made popular by Alice in Chains on some of their later albums), which he uses to fill out the backgrounds of some of these songs. The multitracked Hommes aaah'ing melodramatically in undead unison make slogging through ""Hanging Tree"" and ""Go with the Flow"" a pretty grim endeavor. It doesn't help that these songs churn along interminably long after their riffs have run dry, either. And worse still, the band has quit winking at their metal excesses entirely, toeing the line between mindless fun and xFC-metal gothery. Fortunately, this is only a temporary decline, but that these two tracks hit back-to-back in the dead center of the record makes for a much steeper dropoff than if they'd been sequenced farther apart."

Today, we revisit Beck’s ramshackle 1994 album, a quintessential piece of alternative rock, experimental folk, and hip-hop that felt magically displaced in time.","If you were around to hear Beck’s “Loser” in the early 1990s, you probably felt the plates shift a little. Maybe you heard it on local radio in Los Angeles, where it arrived without context or marketing. Maybe you heard it in Seattle, where, six months after Beck had ad-libbed it in a cramped living-room studio, it became the most requested song on KNDD’s nightly People’s Choice Countdown, beating out the most recent single by Pearl Jam, who at the time may as well have been on the city’s tourism board.Or maybe you, like me, heard it on MTV, where it seemed like a cool breeze blowing through the abstract pain of mainstream alternative music. When, in July, 1994, an interviewer from Spin magazine suggested that Beck’s backstory—poverty, an 8th-grade education, bouts of borderline homelessness—felt like fodder for darker sentiments, Beck, 23 and blindsided by his own new fame, pitched his voice up and whined, “You just gotta rage against the appliance, man. The toast is burning, and you just gotta rip it out and free it before it fills the house with smoke.” For Vedder, hearing “Loser” lap you on the radio must’ve felt like getting hit in the face by trash thrown from a passing car.Much of Mellow Gold was recorded in the home studio of a guy named Carl Stephenson. By “home studio,” I mean a tape recorder set up in such a way that Beck later remembered having to finish vocal takes before Stephenson’s girlfriend wanted to get in and cook dinner. Stephenson had grown up playing in youth symphonies around Olympia, Washington, before quitting his grocery-store job and moving to Houston to work at Rap-A-Lot Records, then home to the Geto Boys. Rap-A-Lot was hardcore; Stephenson was not. He loved watching DJ Ready Red strip samples from old funk and soul records, but he was uncomfortable with the violence and misogyny of the material. He soon moved to Los Angeles, where he struggled to plant his homey, psychedelic productions in an increasingly gangsta market.The way Stephenson remembers it, Beck Hansen was a street busker with a bad haircut. But he had a mischievous sense of creativity and no attachments to his own artistic self-image, and when Stephenson—alongside co-producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock, who ran the small Bong Load label—suggested they pair his rudimentary folk songs with Stephenson’s loops and grooves, Beck went with it. After all, he liked rap—the immediacy, the beat, the sense of performance. In the same Spin interview where he raged against the toaster, he remembered the communal warmth he felt as a teenager riding the bus on L.A., hearing Grandmaster Flash playing on some kids’ boombox from the back, how people from all different parts of the city seemed to absorb the sound, some even getting up to dance."

To make matters worse, his self-titled solo debut, released earlier that year, was a monumental flop, a hastily thrown together collection of second rate re-recordings of Velvet Underground outtakes that lacked the intensity and focus of his earlier music. Reed was at a crossroads, unsure of which direction to take his newfound independence.At the same time, a new trend was emerging across the pond. Glam rock began to flower in 1971, and by the following year had swept up countless British kids, turning them from restless, discontended youths to consummate, androgynous hipsters decked out in platforms, sequins and imposing hair. It was the first mainstream rock movement to openly acknowledge the Velvets' influence, and in Marc Bolan, Ian Hunter and Bryan Ferry, Reed began to see his protégés: the coarse, primal rock 'n' roll he pioneered had found its audience.One of his progeny, a young David Bowie, was hot off the success of his chart-topping The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, and was perhaps the most vociferous in his love of the Velvets and the incalculable influence they'd had on his music. When given the chance, Bowie and guitarist Mick Ronson offered to produce Reed's solo follow-up: what followed was undeniably one of both glam rock's and Reed's finest moments, one that gave him a left-field radio hit and a blueprint for much of his solo work to follow.Thirty years on, Transformer still sounds startlingly fresh, free from many of the clichés that taint other similarly minded records of the period. It also works as an interesting diversion from most of VU's work: where they clearly had a full-band aesthetic, and often leaned toward the avant-garde, Transformer took the strong pop undercurrent that ran throughout their records and indulged. It's still fascinating to hear Reed outside the messy underproduction of the Velvets, yet even with Bowie and Ronson broadening the arrangements, Transformer feels remarkably natural. Their production work was so loaded that, were it not for the incredibly focused songs beneath, it might have been overbearing. But with a solid base, the ornate arrangements help bring these songs to life, lending Reed's music a broader palette. Lou himself, by contrast, sounds as intimate as ever on the record's more sedate tracks, crooning in a sensitive lilt that maintains his blissful, effortless cool."

Cheryl Cole, Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, and Kimberley Walsh were put together on the reality show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, and they proceeded to score 20 consecutive British Top 10 singles over the next seven years. That series of hits may well be their legacy, despite the fact that they've reunited for four new songs on this retrospective, their second greatest hits compilation to date.The most obvious comparison for Girls Aloud is, of course, Spice Girls: cheerful! Euro! girl-power-y! But it might be a little more accurate to compare them to the mid-60s-era Supremes, a group whose presence is all about charm and restraint, and whose behind-the-scenes powerhouse is a brilliantly original writing and production team. In roughly the same way that the Supremes of the period from ""Where Did Our Love Go"" to ""Reflections"" were the vocal adjuncts to Holland-Dozier-Holland, Girls Aloud are basically the most prominent performing associates of Xenomania, the UK song-factory collective centered on Brian Higgins.Xenomania has cranked out dozens of European hits over the past 15 years, for acts like Pet Shop Boys, Sugababes, and Kylie Minogue. They don't exactly have a signature sound, although they do have a signature songwriting style, which seems to consist of writing a lot of songs, then chopping them up into pieces, keeping the catchiest parts, and seeing which ones can be sutured together into new songs. The best Xenomania songs tend to come off like miraculously coordinated mini-suites; the second-rank ones sound more like ""Stars on 45""-style medleys.Girls Aloud, as it happens, got a lot of the best ones. The utterly wonderful ""Biology"" starts with a Chicago electric blues riff, of all things; that gets supplanted by a string of increasingly amazing Eurotechno melodies, the last of which-- the nominal chorus, which finally shows up two minutes in-- somehow transforms itself straight back into the blues riff again. ""Biology"" also features one of the proud Britishisms that are all over their records: ""We're gonna cause a conTROversy,"" Coyle wails. ""The Loving Kind"", which Pet Shop Boys co-wrote with Xenomania, pulls off another one by rhyming its title with ""disinclined.""As you might expect, Xenomania grab hooks wherever they can find them, and another other way of listening to Girls Aloud's hits is to try to catch all the allusions to the past 50 years' worth of pop as they whizz by. ""Love Machine""-- no relation to either the Miracles' or Morning Musume's respective hits called ""Love Machine""-- borrows its groove from the Smiths' ""Rusholme Ruffians"", its chorus melody from the Beatles' ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", and a stray lyric from Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Two Tribes"", for starters. It also contains one of their funniest lines: ""We're gift-wrapped kitty cats/ We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back."""

In roughly the same way that the Supremes of the period from ""Where Did Our Love Go"" to ""Reflections"" were the vocal adjuncts to Holland-Dozier-Holland, Girls Aloud are basically the most prominent performing associates of Xenomania, the UK song-factory collective centered on Brian Higgins.Xenomania has cranked out dozens of European hits over the past 15 years, for acts like Pet Shop Boys, Sugababes, and Kylie Minogue. They don't exactly have a signature sound, although they do have a signature songwriting style, which seems to consist of writing a lot of songs, then chopping them up into pieces, keeping the catchiest parts, and seeing which ones can be sutured together into new songs. The best Xenomania songs tend to come off like miraculously coordinated mini-suites; the second-rank ones sound more like ""Stars on 45""-style medleys.Girls Aloud, as it happens, got a lot of the best ones. The utterly wonderful ""Biology"" starts with a Chicago electric blues riff, of all things; that gets supplanted by a string of increasingly amazing Eurotechno melodies, the last of which-- the nominal chorus, which finally shows up two minutes in-- somehow transforms itself straight back into the blues riff again. ""Biology"" also features one of the proud Britishisms that are all over their records: ""We're gonna cause a conTROversy,"" Coyle wails. ""The Loving Kind"", which Pet Shop Boys co-wrote with Xenomania, pulls off another one by rhyming its title with ""disinclined.""As you might expect, Xenomania grab hooks wherever they can find them, and another other way of listening to Girls Aloud's hits is to try to catch all the allusions to the past 50 years' worth of pop as they whizz by. ""Love Machine""-- no relation to either the Miracles' or Morning Musume's respective hits called ""Love Machine""-- borrows its groove from the Smiths' ""Rusholme Ruffians"", its chorus melody from the Beatles' ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", and a stray lyric from Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Two Tribes"", for starters. It also contains one of their funniest lines: ""We're gift-wrapped kitty cats/ We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back."""

It was\n ...","cLOUDDEAD's debut was an unassuming record, if you overlook how many people it confused or annoyed. It was the breakthrough success for the three artists who spearheaded it, but it built on a series of low-budget and bedroom projects-- like rappers Why? and Doseone's Greenthink project, Dose's murmuring Slowdeath, or producer and DJ Odd Nosdam's Plan 9: Meat Your Hypnotist-- where obtuse verses spilled out like ripped-up paper scraps over hazy, droning vinyl, overheard conversations or snippets from TV, on CDs that were fragmented into at least forty tracks apiece.The cLOUDDEAD project extended those methods; sharp humor and surreal images leavened the album's odd shapelessness, and the band even managed to eke out a few cogent concert pieces for their tour. But the way they stitched the record together was even more interesting: The songs run together at the drop of an attention span, and the band combined them as intuitively as a found sound artist creating order out of tossed-off materials. It had an unfinished feel fed by the two years that they worked on it, at dorms and parents' houses, and even through their relocation from Cincinnati to the Bay Area. It was an album about a process, not an outcome.The cLOUDDEAD record hit, as much as records like that ever do, and the Anticon collective-- of which Why?, Doseone and Odd Nosdam are founding members-- made waves beyond the underground hip-hop community with which it feuded. (And to be clear once again, the group never claimed this project was ""hip-hop,"" although the controversy from purists has done nothing but make people think harder about their work.) So as they finally release their follow-up, Ten, we know more about the artists, and they've grown more into their styles.You can identify the two frontmen at the start of ""Pop Song"": Why?'s the one gently singing, ""Elvis, what happened?"" while Dose chants, ""The wooden man and his splintering self."" Why?'s excellent Oaklandazulasylum revealed a rap-based artist who wants to write songs and strum a guitar, making him one of very few artists trying to cross over from hip-hop to indie rock. Doseone has worked with producer Jel under the name Themselves, and he also came into his own as a performer on his album with Circle, where partner Boom Bip's production challenged the sometimes self-absorbed intricacies of his lyrics.Completing the trio is Odd Nosdam, who produced half the tracks (Why? handled the rest) and played electronic drums. Nosdam demonstrates his deft taste in ambient vinyl and oompah beats, with a couple kitschy samples mixed in; on his tracks, the most static sounds can buzz and excite-- like the smoggy ""Rifle Eyes"", where the crackling noise seems to come from something more sinister than just old vinyl."

Note how ""Hung Up on a Flower"", the otherwise dirgey balladic centerpiece of last year's Endless Flowers, degenerates into two minutes of a woman nattering on in German, her voice echoing out in mutated shapes atop a bed of grimy guitar fuzz. The dying moments of ""I Like It in the Dark"" -- the opening track from Crocodiles' fourth LP, Crimes of Passion -- yield something equally nonsensical yet startling: The song's joyous gospel-delic groove fades out, but singer Brandon Welchez isn't quite finished talking yet, as he lets loose with an extended, a capella stream of beat-poet babble that was seemingly being drowned out all along by the boisterous song preceding it, like a dubbed-over cassette that didn't fully erase its previous contents.No other moment on Crimes of Passion approaches the same degree of wanton absurdity. But where that random Deutsch-laden rant on ""Hung Up on a Flower"" stood into stark contrast to Endless Flowers' student-disco formalism, Crimes of Passion's off-kilter intro serves as a harbinger of the album's guileless, unguarded spirit, as producer Sune Rose Wagner successfully coaxes the band to drop their Ray Bans and reveal the puppy-dog eyes welling up underneath. Sonically, Crocodiles are still very much the sort of band scientifically engineered to appease the small minority who believe the Jesus and Mary Chain's second-best album is Munki (not that there's anything wrong with that); Welchez lets his suggestive lyrics ooze out of his mouth like he was a third Reid brother, and whenever the band deviate from their trusty fuzz-pop playbook, it's in precisely the same ways U.K.-indie idols like Primal Scream and Spiritualized once did, whether deploying roadhouse horns, gospel-diva vocal wails, and steeple-shaking piano rolls as signifiers of Southern-soul authenticity or sci-fi synths to exude some Teutonic futurism. However, thanks to Rose Wagner's punchy production and emphasis on economy, Crimes of Passion-- unlike the band's previous records-- doesn't require the accompaniment of strobe lights and dry ice to fully connect. The new record basks in Endless Flowers' sunny afterglow*,* but the songs here are brasher, nervier, and a lot more fun.Even at its most slavishly Mary Chained-- ""Cockroach"" practically comes outfitted with its own pompadoured Afro-- Crimes of Passion evinces a fidgety, tambourine-rattled exuberance that lends the record a brisk momentum, meaning a band that once routinely droned on past the five-minute mark can now get the job done in three. But the album is most distinguished by its starry-eyed ballads, like the Las-esque jangle-pop standout ""She Splits Me Up"" or the Jean Genet-copping moonlit lullaby ""Un Chant D'amour"". And while it may be a stretch to call the retro-gear fetishism of ""Teardrop Guitar"" a love song, its ecstatic verve makes for as solid a sequel to ""She Bangs the Drum"" as the reunited Stone Roses could come up in 2013 if they tried. Such open-hearted gestures may not be enough to fully redirect Crocodiles away from the nihilism-by-numbers of ""Me and My Machine Gun"" and ""Gimme Some Annihilation"", but they offer encouraging evidence that the band is becoming more adept at not just projecting the aloof attitude of their Brit-rock influences, but their flair for disarming, emotionally resonant songcraft. At this point in the game, we've grown accustomed to seeing Crocodiles flash their teeth; it's much more interesting to see them shed their skin."

They crafted a laid-back sound but kept the tension of heartland rock‘n’roll.","Part of the reason Tom Petty’s passing earlier this month felt so profound was his unofficial status as the mortar of classic-rock radio. The Florida-born, Malibu-haunting music lifer had top billing on a slew of songs that served as the glue between your Stones and Beatles chestnuts—the spitfire chronicle of lovers’ wariness “Refugee,” the sparkle of “The Waiting.” The format’s parameters had already been well-established by the time Full Moon Fever—the first album credited to Petty without his longtime musical pals the Heartbreakers—came out in the spring of 1989. But as soon as its first single, the laid-back yet steadfast “I Won’t Back Down,” was released, the rule book was rewritten.Full Moon Fever came out of a most Southern Californian set of circumstances. In November 1987, Petty—then coming off his seventh album as frontman of the Heartbreakers, Let Me Up (I’ve Had Enough), as well as a May 1987 arson attack on his house—had a chance encounter with Jeff Lynne, the songwriter and maximalist producer behind Electric Light Orchestra, at a traffic light (“just before the Thrifty [Drug Store],” he told SPIN in 1989) that, as it happened, was located near where they lived. Lynne was just off producing George Harrison’s Cloud Nine, the 1987 album that spawned the surprise MTV hit “Got My Mind Set on You,” and was at work on Brian Wilson’s “Let It Shine.” ”Around Christmas that year, I wrote a couple of songs and showed them to [Lynne], and he had a few suggestions, which really improved them,” Petty told The Chicago Tribune in 1989. “So we ended up going over to [Heartbreakers guitarist] Mike Campbell’s house and putting them down in his studio… by then I was already having too much fun and I didn’t want to stop and go back to doing nothing, so I kept convincing Jeff song by song to do one more, and then finally hooked him into finishing the whole album.”Even at its most urgent, Full Moon Fever has a laid-back feel. Petty’s sardonic observations, delivered in his wizened drawl, coast on loose-limbed riffs that were largely written with the rhythm guitar parts at the forefront of Petty and Lynne’s collective mind. Every song was written on 12-string or 6-string acoustic guitars. Petty told The Boston Globe in 1989: “I wanted to experiment with the art of rhythm guitar. Jeff and I feel that acoustic guitars can be rock’n’roll instruments, not just folk instruments.”"

It has resulted in political pundits-- many, it must be noted, with latently racist agendas-- dismissing the entire culture as violent, misogynistic, and ultimately destructive. Stylistically, gangsta is a mesh of Cinema Verite and action blockbusters, where the grime and moral ambivalence of the crack trade clash with the unmitigated bravado of playa anthems. At its best, gangsta delves into these contradictions-- the pull between community and wealth, morality and survival-- with a deftness and wit alternately charming and horrifying.Unfortunately, Get Rich or Die Tryin' rarely reaches these pinnacles; for most of the album's duration, 50 wallows in the genre's clichés. The wit is sparse, the details are slim, and the threats are hollow. This isn't as much a moral quarrel as it is one of thematic development. Biggie came with the soul, Pac came with the charisma, L. had the wit, and Nas had the words. But, with the exception of a few quality verses sprinkled here and there, 50 strikes as a parody of these masters, and does little on his debut to establish a persona of his own. He doesn't delve into the character of the gangsta any deeper than the prosaism he spits, and while he obviously has an excellent vocal cadence and a finely tuned ear, his lyrics lack the textured imagery and dexterity of themes necessary to sustain interest over the course of a full album.In perhaps his biggest misstep, 50 Cent eschews a world inhabited by real people doing real shit for most of Get Rich, instead relying on generalized threats, proclamations of invincibility, and calls for pussy. Even the threats and declarations, bereft of the violent, pull-no-punches absolutism of Big L.'s early horrorcore, seem sanitized for Middle America. To put it bluntly, 50's rap sounds cold and mechanical, as though he were paralyzed by the pressures of hype or the prospect of his album being used as evidence against him in his trial for alleged weapons possession; the album sees him alternately declaring that he cares/doesn't care whether the D.A. hears these tracks.Yet, for all the flaws in 50 Cent's persona, Get Rich or Die Tryin' isn't without its redeeming qualities. For one, the album offers a handful of great singles (obviously: ""In Da Club"", ""Wanksta""), anchored by his distinctive, rolling drawl. Loping beats and Caribbean Casios adorn ""P.I.M.P."" while 50 flosses that misogynistic swagger; trigger-happy snares and organ punches cry out from the Dre-produced highlight ""Heat"". Yet, none of the tracks touch his appearance on 1999's In Too Deep soundtrack-- even while its fish-in-a-barrel attacks on virtually every platinum-selling artist of the last five years smacked of Eminem strategies, ""How to Rob (An Industry Nigga)"" factored heavily into the anticipation surrounding Get Rich, offering a glimpse of the juggernaut he might become."

Rapping entirely in ad-libs, hooks, and Instagram-ready one-liners, he sounded like a kid raised on a strict diet of Get Rich or Die Tryin’, Finally Rich, and Newports. His production, mostly from UK drill beat wizard 808Melo, mixed grimy, fast-paced drums with vocal samples ripped from UK garage and melodies that could score an anime. This stew of influences could only come from an artist raised on the internet, but Pop Smoke’s smooth arrogance and West Indian lingo remains distinctly Brooklyn. Now that “Welcome to the Party” is his borough's current summer anthem, he capitalizes on the momentum with his debut mixtape Meet the Woo.Meet the Woo arrives at a pivotal moment for Brooklyn’s still-growing drill scene. Ever since 22Gz’s “Suburban” and Sheff G’s “No Suburban,” Brooklyn drill has lingered in the shadows of its Chicago and UK counterparts. Even as 22Gz signed to Kodak Black’s Sniper Gang and Sheff G became a phenomenon in New York City high schools, the prevailing theory was that these guys would never break out of the Northeast unless they switched up their style. Meet the Woo doesn’t overthink this dilemma; it’s just Pop Smoke taking nine swings at making the hardest, dirtiest shit he possibly can.Previous singles “Meet the Woo” and “Welcome to the Party” lead off the mixtape and set its sinister tone. Of the new tracks, “Scenario” comes closest to recreating their magic: Pop Smoke’s voice is harrowing and Marvel-supervillain worthy, the beat a haunted amusement park. He doesn’t show a lot of lyrical creativity, but he can catch you off guard with his delivery: On “Better Have Your Gun,” he goes from ignorant bravado—“Shoot a nigga, go to jail for it/Cause I know I got the bail for it”—to demented and playful, whispering designer brands with a nightmarish echo on his voice.  His limitations as a writer are exposed on “Dior”—outside of the mesmerizing hook, which doubles as an Amiri Jeans ad, he sounds stuck, repurposing lines like “Bitch I’ma thot get me lit” and throwing in a lazy and unneccesary and homophobic one-liner.It might be occasionally unimaginative, but overall Meet the Woo injects life into a Brooklyn drill scene that was running on fumes. Pop Smoke just wants to cause chaos and dominate the playlists of every party before the NYPD inevitably shuts them down. He’s already accomplished this feat with “Welcome to the Party,” and something on this mixtape will follow in its footsteps soon. Maybe a Brooklyn drill rapper can break through without changing, after all."

Metro watches the mayhem unfold from the roof of a compound while Morgan Freeman dissuades him from intervening. “Your place in history is already cemented,” Freeman tells him. “You’ve built a legacy, something people will clearly kill for.” A stoic Metro then snatches a chain floating behind a glass case before hopping into a Batmobile-like whip and jetting into the city. It doesn’t make much sense, but it doesn’t have to: Like Metro’s music, the trailer is expensive, exciting, and crammed with vibrant characters—the plot or message hardly matters. Enjoy car chases and sinister 21 Savage verses? Spectacular explosions and generic Travis Scott hooks? Metro Boomin has an album for you.Heroes & Villains, though, is more than just fireworks and big-name features. It’s an ambitious, detail-rich record that splits the difference between streaming fodder and world-building. The rappers featured here are either aging out of the spotlight (Future), transitioning into corporate avatars (Travis Scott) or, unfortunately, serving time behind bars (Young Thug, Gunna). While Heroes & Villains scans as an opus of psychedelic trap and star-laden singles with cool comic book packaging, it almost feels like a last triumphant gasp from the past decade’s most prominent rappers and their favorite hitmaking producer.But Heroes & Villains proves that Metro aspires to more than hits. He first demonstrated his wide-scale vision on 2018’s Not All Heroes Wear Capes, a project in which his sparse, moody beats grew thicker, grander, and more intricate. When he attempted to swerve from his signature sound, though, his limited range was exposed: Metro is great when he makes Metro-type beats, shaky when he ventures outside of his comfort zone. On Heroes & Villains, he surpasses his standard quota of bangers while also taking a few fun risks. A symphonic, Francis and the Lights-esque intro? Why not. An interpolation of Mario Winans’ “I Don’t Wanna Know,” featuring the Weeknd and 21 Savage? Let’s do it. Metro is thinking outside the box a bit more, without sacrificing the foundation of what makes his music so appealing in the first place.Chief among these appeals is his ability to mine grade-A material from his guests. His beats are distinct enough to sound good on their own, yet understated enough to afford a vocalist stylistic freedom. Few artists melodically thrive over a Metro beat like Don Toliver, who delivers two of the album’s more magnetic vocal performances on “Too Many Nights” and “Around Me.” Even Future’s got a little pep in his step here, particularly on the anthemic “Superheroes (Heroes & Villains).” But it’s Young Thug, on “Metro Spider,” who steals the show. Slithering over a menacing string note and ominous piano, he snaps off a string of vivid, eccentric bars about luxury watches and feeling more famous than the president. Unlike other Thug verses that have emerged since his incarceration, “Metro Spider” hardly feels like a leftover—in fact, Metro positions it as the album’s centerpiece."

This is the guy who entered the realm of semi-stardom 15 years ago with “Losing My Edge,” a song that both poked fun at and paid tribute to music snobbery, that imagined a miracle man who witnessed every “seminal” underground event up-close, that used a list of cooler-than-thou names as an impenetrable shield. It made sense for him to concoct his very own “I was there” moment on April 2, 2011, when LCD Soundsystem played what was billed as their final show at the most storied venue in New York City. It was instantly legendary, the underdog’s big day. A perfect ending. Too perfect, maybe.As an ace student of the game—“LCD is a band about a band writing music about writing music,” he once quipped—Murphy knew that he couldn’t just reunite for a lucrative victory lap, playing his most popular songs on Spotify to the genre-agnostic, dance-friendly demographic he helped cultivate throughout the 2000s. It would ruin the legacy and go against everything LCD stood for: integrity, respect, a sly but genuine love of just how much music can shape a human being’s identity. So even though a new album was always planned since the band officially reformed 20 months ago, the intervening hit-filled gigs could feel odd. Yes, they sounded great, and all the members looked excited to be playing together again, but the context was tweaked. LCD Soundsystem were no longer on the cusp of a cultish zeitgeist. Murphy still sang “this could be the last time” during “All My Friends,” though the line’s tang of finality was dulled.For his part, Murphy recently promised to never make a show of LCD’s retirement ever again. But as much as the band’s fourth album, American Dream, marks a rebirth, it’s also obsessed with endings: of friendships, of love, of heroes, of a certain type of geeky fandom, of the American dream itself. These are big, serious topics for a project that essentially started as a goof, but it’s the direction Murphy has taken since Sound of Silver’s “Someone Great” combined his affection for bubbling synths with a poignancy about the fleeting nature of life. Now, as a 47-year-old father of a young child, Murphy is using his long-running affection for bygone post-punk and art-rock sounds to carry on traditions; the album includes pointed references to Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen, Suicide’s Alan Vega, and David Bowie, all of whom passed in the years since LCD’s last record. Whereas Murphy once took on all of these influences lightly and cleverly, they feel heavier across much of American Dream’s 70 minutes, with the lingering responsibilities of a disappearing history becoming more apparent."

Uzi’s still hot off Eternal Atake, one of the year’s best rap albums, and its star-studded B-side, LUV vs. The World 2. On the other hand, Future’s most recent release was High Off Life, a record in which he sounded nearly asleep, as if operating on autopilot. One of the only highlights from High Off Life was the bubbly, Uzi-featuring “All Bad,” a strange yet welcome breath of fresh air that felt like an Eternal Atake cast-off. A collab album from Uzi and the man who inspired his Baby Pluto persona felt inevitable after they appeared on each other’s albums, but the disappointing two-pack of “Patek” and “Over Your Head” from this summer left much to be desired. However, Pluto x Baby Pluto is more than a slight improvement from their earlier missteps—it’s like watching two friends trade lives for a day.They warmly embrace each other’s production choices on here. Future sounds just as comfortable over the cartoony, electronic Working on Dying production as he does on DJ Esco’s racing melodies. The cheery horns and rattling drums of “Bankroll” sound like they were ripped straight from a Stunt Taylor mixtape. The chaotic tracklist puts producers like WOD’s Brandon Finessin and NeilaWorld’s Lukrative, who first rose to prominence on SoundCloud, on the same album as Atlanta veterans like Zaytoven.What Uzi brings to Pluto x Baby Pluto is a revitalizing energy that makes Future wake up for the first time since The WIZRD. On “Marni on Me,” they trade bars over ominous whistles, trying to one-up the other with uncounterable flexes. “I push a button my car need no keys,” Uzi says with a carefree shrug. “I push a button, the car drive by itself,” Future immediately fires back. As the album goes on, their designer lifestyle gets even more animated and expensive. They talk about owing money to Elliot Eliantte and buying out stores in Paris as if these were regular occurrences. But even with all this super-charged energy, it’s hard to ignore the moments where Future lags behind, like his unimaginative hook from “Sleeping on the Floor.”If a project from Future and Lil Uzi didn’t spend some time trying to get their exes to fall back in love with them, it wouldn’t be a project from them at all. On “I Don’t Wanna Break Up,” it’s bizarre hearing someone as self-serious as Future right after Uzi goes full pop-punk on the chorus. “Tryna make better decisions, tryna be more consistent, yeah,” Future dreamily sings. “I’m going through hell just to get to you again.”"

And so here comes his obligatory label compilation, a signal boost for his signees designed to be a flex in and of itself. Only problem is: He doesn’t have much of a crew. The only people in Scott’s orbit are the three rappers signed to his Cactus Jack imprint: Don Toliver, Luxury Tax 50, and Sheck Wes (in a joint deal with GOOD Music). As roster compilations go, this seven-track sampler spread what few assets it has too thin and hardly makes for a showcase.JACKBOYS has been pegged as a “debut album” for the titular crew, but that is clearly an overstatement. There are two Don Toliver songs and one Sheck Wes song. There is one Luxury Tax 50 verse. Travis Scott fills out the tracklist with a 50-second instrumental and a remix to his recent hit single, “Highest in the Room,” with Rosalía and Lil Baby. JACKBOYS is a branding opportunity, pure and simple: From the Harmony Korine cover art to the promotional film shot as if A24 produced a Need For Speed sequel, it all seems like empty influencer bait. This is music as part of a merch bundle, about as necessary as a branded fire extinguisher.With ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott finally earned the maestro mantle he was so eager to bestow upon himself, but that curator’s touch is missing here. Pop Smoke is in his element over AXL’s drill production on “Gatti,” pushing Travis into the margins. The song sounds like diet “Welcome to the Party,” and drill isn’t the kind of subgenre where you’re looking to cut calories. “Out West” finds Young Thug carrying Travis (for the umpteenth time), and in this case Thug is barely even trying. Don Toliver’s “Had Enough” is his song in name only; with Quavo and Offset on hand, it sounds like another Migos demo for the Carters’ album with its blatant “Summer” sample and blank, reference-track vocal takes. The sole JACKBOYS posse cut, “Gang Gang,” is all over the place, squandering WondaGurl production.If anyone comes off like they didn’t waste their time making this, it’s Don Toliver, who goes full tilt even working in the periphery of other people’s songs. His breakthrough on ASTROWORLD’s “Can’t Say” outlined his promise; his was such a distinct performance among an all-star cast that it left listeners scrambling to identify him on the creditless tracklist. He doesn’t squander any of that goodwill here, coming off as a budding talent even as the album grows more and more forgettable. (He scored his first TikTok hit with “No Idea” late last year.) Toliver is like the T-1000 model of Travis Scott: he uses Auto-Tune to similar effect, but he works in a higher octave range than Scott and is simply a more lifelike upgrade of his prototype. This is best expressed on “What to Do?”, a duet with Scott in which they both try to put the pieces of a drunken night back together. It’s Toliver who sounds like he’s rallying, his voice less like a piece of software and more an instrument of feeling. His singsong verse is one of the few moments on JACKBOYS that isn’t just product."

On his debut album, executive-produced by 50 Cent, his voice shines through despite a raft of unnecessary features.","Nearly every New York neighborhood has a character like Pop Smoke: flashy, cocky, trash-talking while hitting a dance, all jokes until suddenly he’s deadly serious. Born Bashar Jackson in Canarsie, Brooklyn, Pop Smoke was raised among blocks so rich with Caribbean culture that his breakout music video was partially filmed at Peppa’s, a local Jamaican jerk chicken hotspot. During the year or so his career lasted, he was the centerpiece of the borough’s drill movement, a subgenre born and popularized in Chicago, and adopted and personalized by New York. By the time he was shot and killed at 20, Pop Smoke wasn’t just a rapper, he was the voice of Brooklyn drill.In the winter of 2018, a teenage Pop Smoke arrived with one of his first-ever recordings, a thunderous remix of Sheff G’s “Panic Part 3.” By the summer, kids across the city were emulating his bellowing voice and signature dance, using any opportunity to shout the quotables off of his instant classic debut mixtape, Meet the Woo—“Bitch, I’m a thot, get me lit,” should replace “Fuhgeddaboudit” on the leaving Brooklyn sign. His breakthrough single, “Welcome to the Party,” was so hot that Nicki Minaj hopped on the remix to assure that Pop would bring Brooklyn drill to the masses. Soon enough, he was riding around the borough in a Bugatti with Travis Scott, in Paris with Virgil Abloh, and shutting down shows in the UK. When his second mixtape rolled around in February, he was a borderline superstar. He was dead less than two weeks later. It went so fast he never even got the chance to perform an official hometown show.Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon, Pop Smoke’s debut album, released posthumously, attempts to cement his legacy by expanding his world. Executive produced by his would-be mentor 50 Cent, it’s big, polished, versatile, feature-packed, and loaded with radio and playlist-friendly records. It’s the type of album that will boost streams, but it runs counter to what made Pop Smoke appealing in the first place. When “Welcome to the Party” and “Dior” first began to play on the radio, it was like the airwaves had been hacked. There was no way this Canarsie rapper with the hulking voice, chanting on nightmarish UK drill beats, was supposed to be playing in between Drake and DaBaby, right? Yet there he was.On Stars, Pop Smoke’s animated personality and charisma are drowned out. We didn’t need Pop Smoke’s wannabe Cali-strip-club anthem with Tyga and Mustard on “West Coast Shit.” Or a hollow Astroworld retread on “Aim for the Moon.” Or a forced Rap Caviar-bound marathon with Lil Baby and DaBaby on “For the Night.” Pop Smoke’s music came to life most when he made a couple of blocks in Canarsie seem like the only place that mattered—a subway ride to SoHo might as well have been a private jet to Bora Bora."

His latest mixtape, Yellow Tape, is a street-rap saga peppered with such trenchant insights, narrating the lonely world of a 22-year-old who has been through more bad times than any 22-year-old deserves.This chronicle begins with Key Glock’s birth. “I came in this world flexin’,” he says on opener “1997” before detailing his reckless existence in what he calls the “trenches.” Over the mournful piano keys and guitar riffs of “What Goes Around Comes Around,” Glock links life lessons from his elders to his dedication to rapping: “My granny told me what’s done in the dark must come to light/I recorded every night, now I got hella ice.” Detailing your come-up is pretty standard street-rap fare, but Glock’s rich use of language and slyly spiritual edge distinguish him.To be sure, Yellow Tape is a brutal record, lyrically and musically. You won’t find a viral hit or lame commercial compromise; there are zero guest rappers diluting Glock’s energy. Even “Amen,” the album’s most obvious reference to faith, finds Glock calling on God not for moral guidance, but to give thanks for his expensive chains, cars and the strength to turn the blocks where his enemies roam into “a morgue.” This autobiography has no sentimental moments.Production is mostly handled by a group of rising beatmakers who serve up moody instrumentals rippling with muscle. Sledgren’s horror-movie orchestration scores a drug-slinging tale on “Mr. Glock”; traditionalists will delight in hearing the young rapper reference old Snoop Dogg bars over BANDPLAY’s hard-hitting drums and swampy bassline on “Dough.” On “Crash,” Glock teams up with seasoned pro Southside, using vocal processing effects to render his voice dank and spectral. As a rapper, Glock’s accent is identifiably Memphis, if not quite the thick drawl of regional forefathers Three 6 Mafia. But like Juicy J, he can be a walking hook machine, coating every bar on songs like “Flyest Highest Coolest Smoothest” with swagger.Glock does have some growing up to do. It’s fair to say that there are occasions when his similes can sound off the shelf—there’s countless references to not letting a woman get between him and his money. But these are small grumbles in a grand scheme. A focused vision of what Glock is capable of, Yellow Tape is a work of wicked truths and unfiltered confidence, a book of genesis that feels like a post-mortem."

It’s led to arguably his most defining trait: the incredibly specific and memorable Drakeisms, which are sometimes delivered with the belief that they’re profound—making them unintentionally funny, too. Think of the melodramatic and self-loathing details that fill up Take Care (“I think I’m addicted to naked pictures/And sittin’ talkin’ ’bout bitches that we almost had”); the batshit diatribe at the end of “Diamonds Dancing”; the mafioso myth making on If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late (“I order that Alfredo Pasta/Then eat in the kitchen like I’m in the mafia”). Even on Views, his most self-serious album, his ego is so goosed up that surely he must know how ridiculous he sounds. But maybe not.In recent years, Drake’s growing desire to be in on the joke has made his writing way less exciting. That’s how we ended up with the failure-to-launch “Toosie Slide” viral dance challenge, the desperation of 2021’s Certified Lover Boy, and now the up-and-down nature of his newest album Honestly, Nevermind. The album threads styles like house and Baltimore and Jersey club into his moody, washed-out foundation. It sounds refreshingly different from any other Drake album, and he brings back his go-to trick of legitimizing trend-hopping by recruiting genre heavyweights into his orbit: South African DJ Black Coffee and chameleonic electronic producer Carnage (under his house alias Gordo) both have major contributions to the production. It’s light and breezy, and the songs flow right into each other like a DJ mix, not unlike 2017’s More Life. All this should work, but it feels a little empty for one glaring reason: Drake’s writing lacks its former zest.Honestly, Nevermind’s most memorable line isn’t actually on the album. In a weepy Apple Music note that accompanied the release, he wrote, “I can’t remember the last time someone put they phone down, looked me in the eyes and asked my current insight on the times.” It is hilarious—a level of self-obsession and delusion missing on the record. On “Calling My Name,” where a pulsing house beat does all the work, Drake talks about lost love with details that amount to, “You’re my water, my refresher/Take off your clothes, relieve pressure.” When he’s not saying anything worthwhile, you tend to zoom in on his singing, but his voice is too one-note to carry the load. Similarly on the 40-produced “Down Hill,” his lyrics about heartbreak are full of banalities. In the past, his genre-bouncing, even if watered-down, was made singular through his writing. Without that, you’re left with a flattened version of a superior, pre-existing sound."

In fact, featurelessness has become a defining trait of the 24-year-old South Memphis rapper’s work; aside from a supporting turn by fellow Paper Route Empire upstart Jay Fizzle on 2017’s Glock Season, none of Glock’s solo releases for the independent label owned by Young Dolph have included other voices—just the effortlessly confident Glizock all by his lonesome. He’s hesitant to offer his own services to other artists too, occasionally showing up on releases from Gucci Mane’s New 1017 but otherwise keeping his circle tight. As he explains on this album’s “Eve,” “They like, “Why you don’t do features?” ’Cause I don’t like meetin’ new n****s.”Glock seems almost uniquely disinterested in playing games, kissing rings, or otherwise seeking approval, and defines himself as “in the streets, not industry.” Songs like “Ambition for Cash” lyrically reflect that emphasis on self-reliance and standing on one’s own. That’s not to say he’s allergic to collaboration: He’s proven his mettle as a tag-team specialist alongside his mentor, Dolph. The pair are more equal partners than teacher and student, their smooth flows interweaving with ease. If Dolph is the self-proclaimed King of Memphis, then Key Glock is somewhere between Merlin and Rasputin, a mysterious man of influence who keeps a low profile but pulls more strings than you’d think.Without trading in nostalgic aesthetics or noticeable samples, Key Glock embodies the spirit of Southern rap more easily than any of the countless contemporary rappers who cite Three 6 Mafia as a formative influence. With a tiptoeing piano line and a little soul sample in the mix, the Juicy J-produced “Gangsta” is right out of the classic Hypnotize Minds songbook; it sounds like it could have been an unused beat from Project Pat’s Mista Don’t Play. Bandplay comes through with church organ swells on “Juicemane” that, befitting the title, sound straight out of a late-2000s OJ da Juiceman mixtape.The drum patterns frequently follow a standard Memphis formula—a series of clean and sturdy kicks and claps, with a dash of trap hi-hat—but Glock’s beats are deceptively complicated, almost baroque, as liable to feature a harp or flute as an 808 cowbell or lighter click. There’s a sense of unease to the piano line 808 Mafia affiliate Pyrex builds “Da Truth” around, a scattered rhythm with sudden pitch shifts. “Can’t Switch” adds dubby drums and a little bit of reggae echo on the keys, not entirely switching up the genre but experimenting with the flavor. When guitars infrequently show up, like on “Luv a Thug” or “Quarterback,” they add a sultry, sensual flavor—a much-needed reminder that the history of Memphis rap is just as much soul music as it is horrorcore. It’s on a song like “Quarterback” where Key Glock demonstrates his greatest strength, not as a pure MC or lyricist but something close to a bandleader, slickly flowing over a clean bass guitar and traces of flute. The Dun Deal-led instrumental feels more like a studio session than a Logic project file."

His voice on the mic is distinctive, a high-pitched whine well-suited to jokes and boasts, but Hykeem Carter, the man behind the persona, often receded from view. Personal details in his music and interviews were scarce, and Keem outright hid his face until he began promoting his 2018 project, The Sound of Bad Habit. Even after revealing himself, he remained tight-lipped, but that didn’t stop eagle-eyed fans from noticing his name in the songwriting and producer credits of Top Dawg Entertainment albums like the 2018 Disney collab Black Panther The Album and Jay Rock’s Redemption. Rumors swirled that Keem was actually Kendrick Lamar’s cousin and merely benefitted from rap nepotism, but as Keem’s popularity and mystique grew on the heels of his 2019 breakout project Die For My Bitch, he kept his distance and mostly let his boisterous music speak for itself.Nepotism or not, the rollout (or, according to former TDE president Dave Free, the “well-executed plan”) for Keem’s debut studio album The Melodic Blue telegraphed a more personal, or at least less secretive, direction for him. He publicly embraced his relationship with Lamar, signing with Lamar and Dave Free’s pgLang collective and releasing the tag-team track “family ties.” The album’s trailer is soundtracked by “scapegoats,” a brief but somber reflection on family that hits a bit closer to home (“Flowers on my uncle’s tomb, thousands to my auntie’s, too/I’m used to taking backstreets, last week was nothing new”) before drawing the curtain back again. While The Melodic Blue is indeed flecked with more intimate writing than usual, it isn’t exactly a confessional. Instead, Keem uses the opportunity to expand his well-established fascination with trap and melody to feature-length—with mixed results.On earlier projects, Keem showed a skill for hopping between rapping and singing, sometimes within the same song. Whether he was screaming “Baby Keem just humbled a model!” on “STATS” or cooing about his indifference toward anyone’s opinions on “Opinions,” it felt like a natural progression, the same artist coming with a different approach. Some of that synergy remains on The Melodic Blue, and the highs are exhilarating. His opening verse on “family ties” is easily among the best of his career. Keem triumphantly skips over horns and thudding 808s with a handful of flows and reminisces on childhood Popeyes trips while puffing out his chest (“It’s a red dot, don’t get on the wrong red-eye”). Both “pink panties” and “first order of business” see Keem switching effortlessly between melody and bars about paying for lace fronts and thanking his mother for her love and support. When he sticks to what initially made Two Phone Baby Keem a success, it’s easy to understand the initial hype."

Between his Snapchats, his advice book, the luxury furniture line (We the Best Home), the podcast, and his reinvention as a self-help guru, Khaled has spent the last decade in pursuit of constant virality, too in on the joke for it to be funny anymore. Following his motivational triumph routine in 2021 feels like discovering you still have the T-Pain app or Lil B’s Basedmojis on your phone—you remember why everyone found them amusing, but you’re a little embarrassed that you once did, too.Buying into DJ Khaled’s shtick has never been a prerequisite for enjoying his music, though. He’s always taken a backseat to the collaborations he curates; and lately, he’s been less of a presence on his albums than ever—he doesn’t even shout or ad-lib much anymore, and that was his one thing. There’s a growing disconnect between Khaled the gregarious living meme and Khaled the auto-pilot behind star-studded rap albums with all the individuality of a Now That’s What I Call Music compilation. Khaled Khaled is his 12th record, and we’re so used to them by now that you can forget what a radical exercise they are: rap albums where the A&R rep is the star, unapologetic unit shifters that don’t even disguise their disinterest in artistry, cohesion, or substance.Khaled’s albums weren’t always this cynical. His earliest records lovingly hyped his native Florida rap scene and other kindred pockets of the south. But over the years, he lost any sense of scene stewardship, and his purview expanded to include anything that sells—out went Trick Daddy and in came Justin Bieber, who joins 21 Savage on one of Khaled Khaled’s lowlights, “Let It Go,” recycling the summery, Bud Light Lime-A-Rita vibes of 2017’s “I’m The One.” Consider it one of Khaled’s unwritten keys: If it worked before, then repeat. It’s not for nothing that he’s made “Another one...” one of his guiding mantras.Khaled’s aversion to risk is unrivaled: He gathers the biggest names in rap, then has them make the same music they’d record on their own anyway. Sometimes staying out of the way works—the album’s first two singles were just Drake solo tracks with Khaled’s name on them. But the returns are never more than the sum of the talent involved. Put Lil Durk and Lil Baby (in the first of his three features on the record) over a brass-knuckled Tay Keith beat on “Every Chance I Get,” and you get an undeniable banger. Weigh down H.E.R. with messy Migos and Meek Mill verses, and you’re cutting your losses."

It’s led to arguably his most defining trait: the incredibly specific and memorable Drakeisms, which are sometimes delivered with the belief that they’re profound—making them unintentionally funny, too. Think of the melodramatic and self-loathing details that fill up Take Care (“I think I’m addicted to naked pictures/And sittin’ talkin’ ’bout bitches that we almost had”); the batshit diatribe at the end of “Diamonds Dancing”; the mafioso myth making on If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late (“I order that Alfredo Pasta/Then eat in the kitchen like I’m in the mafia”). Even on Views, his most self-serious album, his ego is so goosed up that surely he must know how ridiculous he sounds. But maybe not.In recent years, Drake’s growing desire to be in on the joke has made his writing way less exciting. That’s how we ended up with the failure-to-launch “Toosie Slide” viral dance challenge, the desperation of 2021’s Certified Lover Boy, and now the up-and-down nature of his newest album Honestly, Nevermind. The album threads styles like house and Baltimore and Jersey club into his moody, washed-out foundation. It sounds refreshingly different from any other Drake album, and he brings back his go-to trick of legitimizing trend-hopping by recruiting genre heavyweights into his orbit: South African DJ Black Coffee and chameleonic electronic producer Carnage (under his house alias Gordo) both have major contributions to the production. It’s light and breezy, and the songs flow right into each other like a DJ mix, not unlike 2017’s More Life. All this should work, but it feels a little empty for one glaring reason: Drake’s writing lacks its former zest.Honestly, Nevermind’s most memorable line isn’t actually on the album. In a weepy Apple Music note that accompanied the release, he wrote, “I can’t remember the last time someone put they phone down, looked me in the eyes and asked my current insight on the times.” It is hilarious—a level of self-obsession and delusion missing on the record. On “Calling My Name,” where a pulsing house beat does all the work, Drake talks about lost love with details that amount to, “You’re my water, my refresher/Take off your clothes, relieve pressure.” When he’s not saying anything worthwhile, you tend to zoom in on his singing, but his voice is too one-note to carry the load. Similarly on the 40-produced “Down Hill,” his lyrics about heartbreak are full of banalities. In the past, his genre-bouncing, even if watered-down, was made singular through his writing. Without that, you’re left with a flattened version of a superior, pre-existing sound."

It’s ambitious, impressive, and a bit unwieldy.","Kendrick Lamar is a giddy dramatist. He loves to pack his music with perspectives, personifying his many characters and muses with distinct voices, cadences, and beat switches that bring them to life. Those virtuosic tics have made him one of rap’s most celebrated storytellers and stylists; he is the first and only rapper to have won a Pulitzer Prize. For some, Kendrick’s elastic narration and indignant dispatches on Black life have made him a figure of supreme moral authority in hip-hop—a role he spurns on his fifth studio album. Kendrick spends Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers gleefully immolating his cherished reputation, swinging between caustic taunts and plaintive confessions over slick funk and soul production that gleams like shards of a mirror. The double album offers rap’s most jarring heel turn since Future cut loose on Monster, taking an unfocused but probing look at Kendrick’s most elusive character: himself.Five years have passed since Kendrick released the punchy and vivid DAMN. and curated the easygoing soundtrack for Black Panther—eons in the rap world, and quite a chunk of regular time too. Aside from the splashy launch of pgLang, his opaque media company with Dave Free, and a few scattered features, Kendrick has kept a low profile. His final album for his longtime label home Top Dawg Entertainment enters a world shaped by the pandemic, #MeToo, and the global protests against police brutality, events Kendrick comments on across the record while recounting how he’s spent his hiatus. His main priority, however, is clarifying who, exactly, Kendrick Lamar represents.The short answer is his family and his homies. The search for the longer answer propels the album. Prompted by narrator Whitney Alford, his romantic partner since high school, Kendrick opens the record by framing his honesty as dangerous, the first of many disclosures to come. “I been goin’ through somethin’/Be afraid,” he says, a warning that is followed by frantic double-time verses that slink around oblique piano stabs and brisk drums. His rapping jerks and lurches as he reveals he’s going to therapy and wracked by grief and shame, feelings that he copes with through luxury purchases and infidelity. Even as he details a specific fling, his storytelling frays, held together by the repetition of his paramour’s eye color rather than mise-en-scène or dense rhyme.Throughout Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, Kendrick seems to actively reject the elegance and structure of past songs like “DUCKWORTH.” and “good kid,” writing in quick strokes and sketches that channel his messy admissions. Ideas scamper around like field rabbits and he avoids clean hooks, denying the listener easy access to his thoughts. It verges on antipop. His flows streak across “Count Me Out,” bouncing off the kick drum, dancing with the chords. The “Kim”-inspired “We Cry Together” stages a noxious melodrama where Kendrick and Zola star Taylour Paige trade barbs that feel almost improvised despite being tightly rhymed and metered. Eminem can finally retire happy. His commitment to untidiness extends to the production, which is smooth but askew, rhythms and chords stacked precariously. Many of the songs, most of which have at minimum three producers, seem to split at the seams. On “Rich (Interlude),” Duval Timothy’s piano lines drift apart and glom back together, rain into vapor into clouds. On “Purple Hearts,” the drums fall away for the entirety of Ghostface’s stellar verse, strings and splashes of piano shadowing the rapper’s meter. The performances don’t always tap into the lushness of the production, but the beats and occasional R&B sample here and there give the often rambling verses some much-needed shape.Kendrick meanders to the album’s high points, stopping for strange and goofy hot takes on cancel culture, a neuron-melting non-issue that explains literally no rich and famous person’s actual life. His candor turns pugilistic on “N95” and “Worldwide Steppers,” tracks that find him praising Oprah’s moxie (“Say what I want about you niggas, I’m like Oprah, dawg”) and lamenting a time he paid for unhealthy catering. “I am not for the faint of heart,” he says after a preamble by Kodak Black, whose inclusion here and throughout the album brings to mind DaBaby and Marilyn Manson’s appearances on Donda. It's unclear whether his presence is meant to make a case for redemption or musical kinship."

Cut off from the resources and promotional budget of a label, many singers fade into B-list obscurity, their best work behind them. It’s a fate Tinashe might have met after she ended her stymying seven-year run with RCA, but instead, she parlayed her independence into the freest, most exuberant album of her career. Revealing a wider range than any of its predecessors, 2019’s exceptional Songs for You bounded between buoyant R&B, spry dance-pop, minimalist trap, Cali funk, and throwback roller skating jams with such capricious glee, it played as if it’d been sequenced by a giant game show wheel.To the extent that Song for You’s “whatever feels good” approach could be considered a template, Tinashe’s follow-up 333 repeats it, leaning further into the singer’s two great strengths: her omnivorous tastes and her supremely light touch. The outline is the same—brisk songs with lots of movement—but the particulars are even more refined and surprising. “Let Go” introduces the album with a fake-out, a velvety, two-minute neo-soul fantasia that sounds precisely like nothing that follows. “Shy Guy” test-drives a jungle beat for 66 seconds before retiring the idea. The pivots continue one after another, often within the same song. “Small Reminders” is 333’s longest track at four and a half minutes—a veritable Ken Burns documentary by the standards of this album’s fleet pleasures—but it rewards every second, transforming from smoldering jazz into doobie-lighting funk at the flip of a breakbeat.The album also indulges Tinashe’s growing interest in EDM and IDM. On “Unconditional,” her weightless voice triple axles over an intricate Kaytranada beat that continually folds in on itself. But even that song sounds downright understated compared to 333’s title track, a puzzle box that never stops molting its skin. There’s no chorus, or even a clear throughline, just a cosmic scope and a series of bombastic, staccato movements that keep one-upping each other. The song is a flex, a tease of all the fantastic avant music Tinashe could make if she wanted to.But it’s clear she’s not interested in that. Whenever 333 threatens to skew too far left of the dial, it snaps back to instant-gratification R&B like “X,” a Hitmaka-produced sheet burner featuring Jeremih, or “Bouncin,” a gleaming, feeling-myself affirmation (“I been sending dirty pics/Hope they make it to the cloud”). As deft as her stylistic experiments are, Tinashe’s default is bright and poppy, and for all the chocolate ganache she puts on display, she doesn’t deny herself penny candy either. The dance workout “Undo (Back to My Heart)” and Rihanna-esque power ballad “The Chase” may not wow with innovation, but they’re both great jams.Tinashe’s voice glides through much of the record as if she’s smirking at a private joke. Ultimately, it’s that breezy, impish spirit that most distinguishes 333 and its predecessor from her RCA albums. Early in her career, Tinashe was uncomfortably lumped with the era’s alternative-R&B movement and was too often cast against vibey, overly serious production that snuffed out her natural ebullience. With its stodgy interludes and thick ambiance, even her excellent 2014 debut Aquarius occasionally dragged. But 333 never does. It’s Tinashe’s second consecutive triumph, another gregarious rebuke of the notion that R&B has to be difficult or demanding to be transcendent.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

It's an incredibly personal record, as well as a bittersweet final statement of purpose.","Before anyone had a chance to hear 333, the fourth and final full-length from Baltimore garage punk purists Double Dagger, the band's corpse had already begun to reek. The hometown DIY heroes decided to call it quits back in 2011, rounding out their career by recording of the final six songs offered up here, as well as a brief farewell tour. Along for that ride was filmmaker Gabriel DeLoach, who chronicled Double Dagger's last days on the road, cataloging their manic live performances. The resulting footage eventually became the feature-length documentary If We Shout Loud Enough (a DVD of it came bundled with 333 as a Record Store Day perk), which focused not only on Double Dagger's demise, but the larger story of Baltimore's gritty music scene, featuring Future Islands, Dan Deacon, and music historian Tim Kabara, among others, espousing the virtues of Charm City's underground music and arts community. ""Most bands now don't have a personality, they have a haircut. And they don't have a point of view, they have a publicist,"" frontman Nolen Strals mentions in a trailer for the film. ""I'm happy as hell that you could never say that about Double Dagger.""Over Double Dagger's nine years of activity, the trio never strayed from their core principles. Musically, things couldn't get much more basic, with Bruce Willen on bass, Denny Bowen on drums, and Strals on vocals. Fundamentally, they were amongst a dwindling number of bands using punk as a soapbox, decrying false prophets, the commodification of art, the hollowness of social climbing, and just about anything else that smelled fishy to them along the way (they're the same band that denounced the futility of a life spent online before Facebook had even been invented). But instead of allowing their slavish adherence to a set of pre-prescribed ethics translating as chilling, Double Dagger used these seemingly simple guidelines to reinforce and strengthen their sound and aesthetic.As musicians, Double Dagger are rare in their ability to make so much out of so little, with Bowen smashing away at his kit like a pissed off Thing, and Willen defying the limitations of what most assume a bass guitar can do, coaxing a wide variation of sounds from his instrument while still (sometimes simultaneously) conjuring an earthquaking thrash. And Strals, alternating between plainspoken rants and throat-ribboning shouts, was often as invaluable as a piece of human projectile as a mouthpiece. (His role as mouthpiece was, in fact, an inspiring one-- having a microphone in his hand was the only real remedy for his pronounced stutter.) You could fault the band for being a bit too preachy, a bit too rigid in their outlook, too smart aleck-y for their own good. But more often than not, Double Dagger did things with such passion, humor and energy, these slight annoyances barely scanned. Plus, they were a band that got better with each release (see 2010's sharpened Masks EP for evidence), and 333 is once again no exception."

The shift in speed works, somehow making Swanson's warning about an embroiled eternity seem great-- the kind of stuff that, several decades ago, you might've pumped your fist to in an outsized arena. Closer ""Lucky Bones"" triggers back and forth between mid-tempo quake, squealing solos, and an inescapable chorus, with several short, forlorn sections lending appropriate gravity to the song's observations on burial, or being ""given to the dust."" Again, these sprawls work because they're so very immersive, temporarily beating back Hour of 13's revivalist stigma.But if this music already exists within a canon so well-established to not only have classics but successors who have pushed those sounds into dizzying new realms, why bother listening to it? It's a query that 333 refuses to approach or ease; there are no nods to funeral doom, noise or abstraction at large here, no post-modern referents to prompt lengthy features in The New York Times or the New Yorker. Hour of 13-- or at least this lineup, featuring Swanson and Davis-- broke up and reunited since the release of their 2010 album, The Ritualist. Swanson temporarily yielded the frontman throne. It's nearly possible to perceive that difficult delivery here within the enthusiasm and earnestness with which these seven songs are offered; Swanson and Davis play them hard, fast, and fun, a quality that might just be the record's chief surprise. In playing these tunes like they nearly never recorded them, Hour of 13 recharge the music of Cathedral, Candlemass, and Pentagram rather than simply remake it."

It's a query that 333 refuses to approach or ease; there are no nods to funeral doom, noise or abstraction at large here, no post-modern referents to prompt lengthy features in The New York Times or the New Yorker. Hour of 13-- or at least this lineup, featuring Swanson and Davis-- broke up and reunited since the release of their 2010 album, The Ritualist. Swanson temporarily yielded the frontman throne. It's nearly possible to perceive that difficult delivery here within the enthusiasm and earnestness with which these seven songs are offered; Swanson and Davis play them hard, fast, and fun, a quality that might just be the record's chief surprise. In playing these tunes like they nearly never recorded them, Hour of 13 recharge the music of Cathedral, Candlemass, and Pentagram rather than simply remake it."

Baby came up watching Young Thug and Migos in the studio, and it was Thug’s eager cosign along with the backing of Migos’ label Quality Control that put him on the national radar last year, mere months after he picked up a microphone—an incredible stroke of fortune for someone who’d spent the previous two years “sitting in prison getting no mail,” as he puts it here.Baby’s rapping isn’t any flashier than his fashion sense. He rhymes in a tuneful, half-sung stream of thought, sort of like a more nuanced Rich Homie Quan. On a purely technical level, he’s impressive. His words are vivid, his emotions pronounced, and his flow is frictionless; he hovers just over every beat like a puck on an air hockey table. In a rap scene suddenly dominated by eccentrics and self-proclaimed rock stars, there’s room for a rapper this grounded, even if that isn’t the most exciting stake to claim. His practical, melodic flow is an alternative to Migos’ staccato patter or the indifference of SoundCloud rappers like Playboi Carti—a respectable option for listeners who like the general sound of Atlanta right now, but find some of those other guys over-the-top.Harder Than Ever is mostly of a piece with the mixtapes that preceded it, it does flaunt some of the privileges of Baby’s rising stature. The beats are a little better this time, more voluptuous and, yes, harder. Baby leans particularly on producer Quay Global, whose work is a bit like Baby’s delivery: polished, efficient, and kind of nondescript. And most prominently, Baby has landed a Drake feature, the ultimate score for any rapper looking to take their regional act global.What a debacle their collaboration turns out to be, though. While Drake does just enough to make sure “Yes Indeed” charts, Baby completely flubs his verse, inexplicably adopting a quirky flow that cuts against his entire persona. Pitching his voice somewhere between Young Thug at his whiniest and Pharrell’s deliberately dopey Swae Lee impression from “Chanel,” he even tests a dead-on-arrival catchphrase: “Wahhhh wahhhh wahhhh, bitch I’m Lil Baby.” It’s a complete misrepresentation of what he stands for, an introduction to a far more insufferable rapper than the one who’s been building heat for the last year.The album’s other features fare better, especially the ones from some of those aforementioned weirdos. Lil Uzi Vert and Young Thug both sweep through their tracks with the crazed velocity of untied helium balloons, and Offset absolutely crushes “Transporter,” sending volts through the track. Lil Baby takes his verse after Offset’s, and dexterous as it is, it’s a bit like trying to follow an incredible magic act with a PowerPoint presentation about fuel economy—highlighting the challenge of being a rapper as low-key as Baby. In a thrilling world of weirdos, it takes more than just showing up to make an impact."

Lil Uzi Vert),0.0,1.0,11.0,0.0611,trap,8.1,The Atlanta trio Migos come back after a commercial and creative dry spell with a #1 single and a definitive work.,"Okay, just for a second—as a thought experiment—let’s treat Culture as the sophomore album from the Migos. In this reality, it marks a sharp improvement from the North Atlanta trio’s debut, 2015’s Yung Rich Nation, an album that showed a tremendous amount of technical dexterity, but stiffer writing and only half-formed pop instincts. The Migos are better now, we’d say. They really grew.In the real world, of course, Culture comes in a long, long line of hits, mixtapes, and one-offs. Since “Versace” and Y.R.N. (Young Rich Niggas) marked their breakthrough in 2013, they’ve been one of the most influential acts in hip-hop, and frequently one of the best. Their most obvious mark on the culture has been the tight, triplet-laced flow they resurrected and perfected. They also brought the dab to the world at large, and injected a handful of slang terms into the syntaxes of aspiring rappers from coast to coast.So Culture arrives in what feels like the second act of a long career, by rap standards. The Migos came out as young upstarts, suffered through a litany of legal hang-ups and incarcerations, had short creative dry spells where they sniped at the kids on the lawn stealing their styles, and eventually came back around. This time, they have a #1 hit in tow, and they want to stick at the top of the commercial pyramid.The first voice you hear on Culture is DJ Khaled’s, which couldn’t be more misleading. This isn’t a big-budget parade of set pieces and stunt casting; if anything, it’s remarkable for how long stretches of it are sober, somber. Culture’s midpoint is the phenomenal, Zaytoven-produced “Big on Big,” which is towering and defiant, and even flips their well-documented label troubles into a point of pride. That track is followed by two more (“What the Price,” “Brown Paper Bag”) that stick to minor keys and contemplative piano. There are plenty of stray prescription pills and idle threats to go around, but they’ve been reassembled to be eerier, more perilous. (Incidentally, this would have been a perfect place to insert “Cocoon,” their staggering loosie from last year.)Culture is front-loaded with singles, which—perhaps counter-intuitively—makes for a nice balance. Heard back-to-back-to-back, “T-Shirt,” “Call Casting,” and “Bad and Boujee” are not only packed with color and virtuosic rapping, but elucidate exactly what each of the three rappers bring to the table, how they complement one another. Hearing Quavo float is a joy, but it’s even better when it’s underscored by Takeoff’s bass and Offset’s serration. There are also fascinating reconciliations: The Cardo-produced, 2 Chainz-featuring “Deadz” seems to find a middle ground between the sparse Atlanta sounds and Chicago’s maximalism that were warring around the time of Y.R.N."

T-Shyne),0.0,1.0,1.0,0.00669,trap,6.7,"The latest compilation from Young Thug’s YSL label is packed with appearances from rap’s biggest stars, though its flamboyant host seems content to take a backseat.","In 2016, Young Thug received a dressing-down on national television, at the hands of his then-mentor and label boss, Lyor Cohen. “You just record so many songs and leave them like little orphans out there,” Cohen snapped, during a meeting that was filmed for the CNBC show “Follow the Leader”. Cohen had a point. Thug had been recording at a furious pace, as leak dumps of hundreds of tracks revealed. And yet, the announcement of his debut album failed to stick, much like his short-lived name changes. A steady stream of mixtapes showed an artist who was evolving at a pace that was hard to comprehend and who didn’t always care for details like editing and sequencing. His innovations in songwriting and vocal delivery were pushing rap forward, but it was difficult to imagine Young Thug ever becoming an elder statesman—if anything, he seemed like a shooting star that we were lucky to have witnessed at all.In hindsight, 2019’s So Much Fun looks like a turning point in Thug’s career. It stands as his most focused and consistent release since the mid-career masterpiece Barter 6. So Much Fun was also the first time we’d seen Thug standing still; it’s hard to point to something on the album that he hadn’t done before. What was new was the way that Thug ceded so many of that album’s big moments to his mentees Gunna and Lil Baby, both of whom have arguably become even better-known than Thug among younger listeners. Slime Language 2 expands on that approach: here Thug comfortably rubs shoulders with superstars, peers, influences, and descendants, serving as the glue that holds these songs together while rarely commanding the spotlight. He feels a bit like Jay Gatsby here: the guests are glamorous and the trappings of the party are opulent, but the host is content to recede into the background.Still, a party’s a party, and much like with the previous installment, the aspiration here is clearly to provide an hour of breezy songs designed to go off during the summer. Surely a few of these will. ""Solid"" feels by turns like a Drake song, a Gunna song and a Thug song, each rapper fully commanding the shifting, distant beat. Lil Uzi Vert draws a line in the sand between himself and his elusive host by infusing ""Proud of You"" with a gracious, wide-eyed sincerity (he also coins the term “Smithstoneian”). In one of his first high-profile appearances since his release from a New York state prison, Rowdy Rebel stomps all over the horn-filled fanfare of ""Came and Saw,"" which feels like a sequel to Thug and Gunna’s hit “Hot.” It's telling that ""Superstar"" is one of the weirdest songs on here thanks to an appearance from Thug’s direct antecedent, Future: the trap legend reaches for notes out of his range and coos in a singsong cadence over what sounds like kazoos while Thug just coasts comfortably."
3Kh5a6vXMiJtC35jMEfmyy,0.928,109.966,0.616,hip-hop,-2.34,0.156,0.23,Matuê,4.0,0.043,70,333,Trap,Castlevania,0.0,0.0,9.0,0.0168,trap,7.8,"Parlaying creative independence into her best work to date, the R&B star’s latest self-released album is a showcase for her omnivorous tastes and supremely light touch.","For all the indignities that major labels subject R&B artists to—the constant album delays, retoolings, and forced-fit singles—life after the majors is rarely glamorous. Cut off from the resources and promotional budget of a label, many singers fade into B-list obscurity, their best work behind them. It’s a fate Tinashe might have met after she ended her stymying seven-year run with RCA, but instead, she parlayed her independence into the freest, most exuberant album of her career. Revealing a wider range than any of its predecessors, 2019’s exceptional Songs for You bounded between buoyant R&B, spry dance-pop, minimalist trap, Cali funk, and throwback roller skating jams with such capricious glee, it played as if it’d been sequenced by a giant game show wheel.To the extent that Song for You’s “whatever feels good” approach could be considered a template, Tinashe’s follow-up 333 repeats it, leaning further into the singer’s two great strengths: her omnivorous tastes and her supremely light touch. The outline is the same—brisk songs with lots of movement—but the particulars are even more refined and surprising. “Let Go” introduces the album with a fake-out, a velvety, two-minute neo-soul fantasia that sounds precisely like nothing that follows. “Shy Guy” test-drives a jungle beat for 66 seconds before retiring the idea. The pivots continue one after another, often within the same song. “Small Reminders” is 333’s longest track at four and a half minutes—a veritable Ken Burns documentary by the standards of this album’s fleet pleasures—but it rewards every second, transforming from smoldering jazz into doobie-lighting funk at the flip of a breakbeat.The album also indulges Tinashe’s growing interest in EDM and IDM. On “Unconditional,” her weightless voice triple axles over an intricate Kaytranada beat that continually folds in on itself. But even that song sounds downright understated compared to 333’s title track, a puzzle box that never stops molting its skin. There’s no chorus, or even a clear throughline, just a cosmic scope and a series of bombastic, staccato movements that keep one-upping each other. The song is a flex, a tease of all the fantastic avant music Tinashe could make if she wanted to.But it’s clear she’s not interested in that. Whenever 333 threatens to skew too far left of the dial, it snaps back to instant-gratification R&B like “X,” a Hitmaka-produced sheet burner featuring Jeremih, or “Bouncin,” a gleaming, feeling-myself affirmation (“I been sending dirty pics/Hope they make it to the cloud”). As deft as her stylistic experiments are, Tinashe’s default is bright and poppy, and for all the chocolate ganache she puts on display, she doesn’t deny herself penny candy either. The dance workout “Undo (Back to My Heart)” and Rihanna-esque power ballad “The Chase” may not wow with innovation, but they’re both great jams.Tinashe’s voice glides through much of the record as if she’s smirking at a private joke. Ultimately, it’s that breezy, impish spirit that most distinguishes 333 and its predecessor from her RCA albums. Early in her career, Tinashe was uncomfortably lumped with the era’s alternative-R&B movement and was too often cast against vibey, overly serious production that snuffed out her natural ebullience. With its stodgy interludes and thick ambiance, even her excellent 2014 debut Aquarius occasionally dragged. But 333 never does. It’s Tinashe’s second consecutive triumph, another gregarious rebuke of the notion that R&B has to be difficult or demanding to be transcendent.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

It's an incredibly personal record, as well as a bittersweet final statement of purpose.","Before anyone had a chance to hear 333, the fourth and final full-length from Baltimore garage punk purists Double Dagger, the band's corpse had already begun to reek. The hometown DIY heroes decided to call it quits back in 2011, rounding out their career by recording of the final six songs offered up here, as well as a brief farewell tour. Along for that ride was filmmaker Gabriel DeLoach, who chronicled Double Dagger's last days on the road, cataloging their manic live performances. The resulting footage eventually became the feature-length documentary If We Shout Loud Enough (a DVD of it came bundled with 333 as a Record Store Day perk), which focused not only on Double Dagger's demise, but the larger story of Baltimore's gritty music scene, featuring Future Islands, Dan Deacon, and music historian Tim Kabara, among others, espousing the virtues of Charm City's underground music and arts community. ""Most bands now don't have a personality, they have a haircut. And they don't have a point of view, they have a publicist,"" frontman Nolen Strals mentions in a trailer for the film. ""I'm happy as hell that you could never say that about Double Dagger.""Over Double Dagger's nine years of activity, the trio never strayed from their core principles. Musically, things couldn't get much more basic, with Bruce Willen on bass, Denny Bowen on drums, and Strals on vocals. Fundamentally, they were amongst a dwindling number of bands using punk as a soapbox, decrying false prophets, the commodification of art, the hollowness of social climbing, and just about anything else that smelled fishy to them along the way (they're the same band that denounced the futility of a life spent online before Facebook had even been invented). But instead of allowing their slavish adherence to a set of pre-prescribed ethics translating as chilling, Double Dagger used these seemingly simple guidelines to reinforce and strengthen their sound and aesthetic.As musicians, Double Dagger are rare in their ability to make so much out of so little, with Bowen smashing away at his kit like a pissed off Thing, and Willen defying the limitations of what most assume a bass guitar can do, coaxing a wide variation of sounds from his instrument while still (sometimes simultaneously) conjuring an earthquaking thrash. And Strals, alternating between plainspoken rants and throat-ribboning shouts, was often as invaluable as a piece of human projectile as a mouthpiece. (His role as mouthpiece was, in fact, an inspiring one-- having a microphone in his hand was the only real remedy for his pronounced stutter.) You could fault the band for being a bit too preachy, a bit too rigid in their outlook, too smart aleck-y for their own good. But more often than not, Double Dagger did things with such passion, humor and energy, these slight annoyances barely scanned. Plus, they were a band that got better with each release (see 2010's sharpened Masks EP for evidence), and 333 is once again no exception."

Frontman Phil Swanson's piercing wail pairs high-flying Ozzyisms with theatric harmonies and verses so pensive you'd swear he was cupping a chalice. Arranger and multi-instrumentalist Chad Davis wraps massive, squealing solos through most every space he can. It's a sound that Jack Black might conjure for his next rock'n'roll hero. Meanwhile, the title and cover of Hour of 13's latest and third album, 333, both seem custom-crafted by a marketing firm you'd never hire: ""Let's cut the Number of the Beast in half, because everyone loves a good Crowley reference, etch it into a big-jawed skull lit by candlelight, and put it in the middle of three gold-embossed triangles. And don't forget the freak-show font. Those dark kids will just love it.""While their gestures and symbols are inarguably mawkish and predictable, even in a field with an unending history of such, Hour of 13's swill of lurching Saint Vitus-style doom and gymnastic New Wave of British Heavy Metal technique makes the band itself a rarity-- an act evidently reverent to its stylistic forebears but energized as if they'd invented this music themselves. ""Deny the Cross"" takes the lead for 333; it's a passionate, dynamic expanse, shifting between moments of head-banging rumble and psychedelic smear. On ""Rite of Samhain"", Davis inlays crisscrossing guitars above a basic rhythm section, a prototypical doomy chug offset by kinetic bursts cutting constantly through the track. Swanson's voice is masterful, occasionally doubling and tripling itself to foster a sense of spectacle. The duo's transitions-- whether a basic drum fill or quick and extended guitar lick-- serve these songs well, too, helping the pieces Davis and Swanson put together actually stay that way.Indeed, Hour of 13's most audacious tracks are, at least on 333, also their best. ""Lucky Bones"" and ""The Burning"", the two multi-part tunes that break the eight-minute mark, overcome the obvious stylistic touchstones from sheer force of will, allowing the disbelief-- an American crew in 2012, making this music so well, in the South-- not to be simply suspended but almost forgotten altogether. After a compelling intro that touches at the edge of stoner metal, ""The Burning"" lets Swanson set up his story-- essentially, the cost of sin is damnation, and now you are burning, so whatever, mortal. The song's middle third picks up the pace to, if you will, turn up the heat on the same topic. ""Divorced from salvation,"" Swanson sings over one of the record's best sprints, ""into damnation."" The shift in speed works, somehow making Swanson's warning about an embroiled eternity seem great-- the kind of stuff that, several decades ago, you might've pumped your fist to in an outsized arena. Closer ""Lucky Bones"" triggers back and forth between mid-tempo quake, squealing solos, and an inescapable chorus, with several short, forlorn sections lending appropriate gravity to the song's observations on burial, or being ""given to the dust."" Again, these sprawls work because they're so very immersive, temporarily beating back Hour of 13's revivalist stigma.But if this music already exists within a canon so well-established to not only have classics but successors who have pushed those sounds into dizzying new realms, why bother listening to it? It's a query that 333 refuses to approach or ease; there are no nods to funeral doom, noise or abstraction at large here, no post-modern referents to prompt lengthy features in The New York Times or the New Yorker. Hour of 13-- or at least this lineup, featuring Swanson and Davis-- broke up and reunited since the release of their 2010 album, The Ritualist. Swanson temporarily yielded the frontman throne. It's nearly possible to perceive that difficult delivery here within the enthusiasm and earnestness with which these seven songs are offered; Swanson and Davis play them hard, fast, and fun, a quality that might just be the record's chief surprise. In playing these tunes like they nearly never recorded them, Hour of 13 recharge the music of Cathedral, Candlemass, and Pentagram rather than simply remake it."

Those dark kids will just love it.""While their gestures and symbols are inarguably mawkish and predictable, even in a field with an unending history of such, Hour of 13's swill of lurching Saint Vitus-style doom and gymnastic New Wave of British Heavy Metal technique makes the band itself a rarity-- an act evidently reverent to its stylistic forebears but energized as if they'd invented this music themselves. ""Deny the Cross"" takes the lead for 333; it's a passionate, dynamic expanse, shifting between moments of head-banging rumble and psychedelic smear. On ""Rite of Samhain"", Davis inlays crisscrossing guitars above a basic rhythm section, a prototypical doomy chug offset by kinetic bursts cutting constantly through the track. Swanson's voice is masterful, occasionally doubling and tripling itself to foster a sense of spectacle. The duo's transitions-- whether a basic drum fill or quick and extended guitar lick-- serve these songs well, too, helping the pieces Davis and Swanson put together actually stay that way.Indeed, Hour of 13's most audacious tracks are, at least on 333, also their best. ""Lucky Bones"" and ""The Burning"", the two multi-part tunes that break the eight-minute mark, overcome the obvious stylistic touchstones from sheer force of will, allowing the disbelief-- an American crew in 2012, making this music so well, in the South-- not to be simply suspended but almost forgotten altogether. After a compelling intro that touches at the edge of stoner metal, ""The Burning"" lets Swanson set up his story-- essentially, the cost of sin is damnation, and now you are burning, so whatever, mortal. The song's middle third picks up the pace to, if you will, turn up the heat on the same topic. ""Divorced from salvation,"" Swanson sings over one of the record's best sprints, ""into damnation."" The shift in speed works, somehow making Swanson's warning about an embroiled eternity seem great-- the kind of stuff that, several decades ago, you might've pumped your fist to in an outsized arena. Closer ""Lucky Bones"" triggers back and forth between mid-tempo quake, squealing solos, and an inescapable chorus, with several short, forlorn sections lending appropriate gravity to the song's observations on burial, or being ""given to the dust."" Again, these sprawls work because they're so very immersive, temporarily beating back Hour of 13's revivalist stigma.But if this music already exists within a canon so well-established to not only have classics but successors who have pushed those sounds into dizzying new realms, why bother listening to it? It's a query that 333 refuses to approach or ease; there are no nods to funeral doom, noise or abstraction at large here, no post-modern referents to prompt lengthy features in The New York Times or the New Yorker. Hour of 13-- or at least this lineup, featuring Swanson and Davis-- broke up and reunited since the release of their 2010 album, The Ritualist. Swanson temporarily yielded the frontman throne. It's nearly possible to perceive that difficult delivery here within the enthusiasm and earnestness with which these seven songs are offered; Swanson and Davis play them hard, fast, and fun, a quality that might just be the record's chief surprise. In playing these tunes like they nearly never recorded them, Hour of 13 recharge the music of Cathedral, Candlemass, and Pentagram rather than simply remake it."

Over the course of his immortal four-project run in the mid-2010s—Monster, Beast Mode, 56 Nights, and Dirty Sprite 2—the word became the defining trait of his persona. As he emerged as one of rap’s biggest superstars, it was like his conscience was telling him one thing and his masculinity another. But “toxic” also flattened the emotional complexity and thoughtfulness of Future’s songwriting. He wrote brooding sagas about self-inflicted heartbreak; candid reflections on the drugs that he blamed for his pain and relied on to heal it, too; turn-up joints about a life of luxury layered with the sense that he was overcompensating for lost love. Often on these tapes, he could go through all those feelings in one verse, blurring reality and myth.But since then, despite some great moments—specifically 2017’s HNDRXX—Future has increasingly become a caricature of himself. His writing started to feel one-dimensional, embellishing the Future persona with even more devious lines. His stories used to contain mistakes and melodrama, but lately it feels like the goal is to get one over on the women he sings about. His latest album I Never Liked You—the title sounds like a breakup note passed in the back of a middle-school classroom—has the ingredients of a really good Future album but lacks the depth of one. It plays it safe by continuing to lean too hard on the schtick.Still, Future is such a slick rapper and vocalist that his songs are pretty fun even when the lyrics feel routine. “I’m Dat Nigga” introduces a bunch of subtle yet exciting change-ups to his flow: He accelerates for a couplet, slows down for the next, and by the end, he’s in full boastful monologue mode. The eeriness of “Puffin on Zootiez” might make you believe Future is saying more than he actually is, but it’s OK because his downbeat yet rapid delivery and the ornate instrumental carry the song. The repetitive but memorable “Chickens” is a highlight, as Future embraces the cartoonish side of his character and gets a fresh burst of energy from EST Gee’s menace.But Gee is the only collaboration on the album that feels inspired; the others are so formulaic that they’re indistinguishable. Check “Wait For U” with Drake: Sampling Tems’ “Higher” is a cheat code to a catchy song, but Future and Drake are on such autopilot that I’d rather listen to the original. The other joint with Drake, “I’m on One,” wouldn’t have even made the cut for What a Time to Be Alive. “For a Nut,” with Young Thug and Gunna, is the bottom of the barrel. The song is supposed to be a sleazy, darkly funny good time, but the lyrics are so half-assed that they come off more like a parody."

Cut off from the resources and promotional budget of a label, many singers fade into B-list obscurity, their best work behind them. It’s a fate Tinashe might have met after she ended her stymying seven-year run with RCA, but instead, she parlayed her independence into the freest, most exuberant album of her career. Revealing a wider range than any of its predecessors, 2019’s exceptional Songs for You bounded between buoyant R&B, spry dance-pop, minimalist trap, Cali funk, and throwback roller skating jams with such capricious glee, it played as if it’d been sequenced by a giant game show wheel.To the extent that Song for You’s “whatever feels good” approach could be considered a template, Tinashe’s follow-up 333 repeats it, leaning further into the singer’s two great strengths: her omnivorous tastes and her supremely light touch. The outline is the same—brisk songs with lots of movement—but the particulars are even more refined and surprising. “Let Go” introduces the album with a fake-out, a velvety, two-minute neo-soul fantasia that sounds precisely like nothing that follows. “Shy Guy” test-drives a jungle beat for 66 seconds before retiring the idea. The pivots continue one after another, often within the same song. “Small Reminders” is 333’s longest track at four and a half minutes—a veritable Ken Burns documentary by the standards of this album’s fleet pleasures—but it rewards every second, transforming from smoldering jazz into doobie-lighting funk at the flip of a breakbeat.The album also indulges Tinashe’s growing interest in EDM and IDM. On “Unconditional,” her weightless voice triple axles over an intricate Kaytranada beat that continually folds in on itself. But even that song sounds downright understated compared to 333’s title track, a puzzle box that never stops molting its skin. There’s no chorus, or even a clear throughline, just a cosmic scope and a series of bombastic, staccato movements that keep one-upping each other. The song is a flex, a tease of all the fantastic avant music Tinashe could make if she wanted to.But it’s clear she’s not interested in that. Whenever 333 threatens to skew too far left of the dial, it snaps back to instant-gratification R&B like “X,” a Hitmaka-produced sheet burner featuring Jeremih, or “Bouncin,” a gleaming, feeling-myself affirmation (“I been sending dirty pics/Hope they make it to the cloud”). As deft as her stylistic experiments are, Tinashe’s default is bright and poppy, and for all the chocolate ganache she puts on display, she doesn’t deny herself penny candy either. The dance workout “Undo (Back to My Heart)” and Rihanna-esque power ballad “The Chase” may not wow with innovation, but they’re both great jams.Tinashe’s voice glides through much of the record as if she’s smirking at a private joke. Ultimately, it’s that breezy, impish spirit that most distinguishes 333 and its predecessor from her RCA albums. Early in her career, Tinashe was uncomfortably lumped with the era’s alternative-R&B movement and was too often cast against vibey, overly serious production that snuffed out her natural ebullience. With its stodgy interludes and thick ambiance, even her excellent 2014 debut Aquarius occasionally dragged. But 333 never does. It’s Tinashe’s second consecutive triumph, another gregarious rebuke of the notion that R&B has to be difficult or demanding to be transcendent.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

It's an incredibly personal record, as well as a bittersweet final statement of purpose.","Before anyone had a chance to hear 333, the fourth and final full-length from Baltimore garage punk purists Double Dagger, the band's corpse had already begun to reek. The hometown DIY heroes decided to call it quits back in 2011, rounding out their career by recording of the final six songs offered up here, as well as a brief farewell tour. Along for that ride was filmmaker Gabriel DeLoach, who chronicled Double Dagger's last days on the road, cataloging their manic live performances. The resulting footage eventually became the feature-length documentary If We Shout Loud Enough (a DVD of it came bundled with 333 as a Record Store Day perk), which focused not only on Double Dagger's demise, but the larger story of Baltimore's gritty music scene, featuring Future Islands, Dan Deacon, and music historian Tim Kabara, among others, espousing the virtues of Charm City's underground music and arts community. ""Most bands now don't have a personality, they have a haircut. And they don't have a point of view, they have a publicist,"" frontman Nolen Strals mentions in a trailer for the film. ""I'm happy as hell that you could never say that about Double Dagger.""Over Double Dagger's nine years of activity, the trio never strayed from their core principles. Musically, things couldn't get much more basic, with Bruce Willen on bass, Denny Bowen on drums, and Strals on vocals. Fundamentally, they were amongst a dwindling number of bands using punk as a soapbox, decrying false prophets, the commodification of art, the hollowness of social climbing, and just about anything else that smelled fishy to them along the way (they're the same band that denounced the futility of a life spent online before Facebook had even been invented). But instead of allowing their slavish adherence to a set of pre-prescribed ethics translating as chilling, Double Dagger used these seemingly simple guidelines to reinforce and strengthen their sound and aesthetic.As musicians, Double Dagger are rare in their ability to make so much out of so little, with Bowen smashing away at his kit like a pissed off Thing, and Willen defying the limitations of what most assume a bass guitar can do, coaxing a wide variation of sounds from his instrument while still (sometimes simultaneously) conjuring an earthquaking thrash. And Strals, alternating between plainspoken rants and throat-ribboning shouts, was often as invaluable as a piece of human projectile as a mouthpiece. (His role as mouthpiece was, in fact, an inspiring one-- having a microphone in his hand was the only real remedy for his pronounced stutter.) You could fault the band for being a bit too preachy, a bit too rigid in their outlook, too smart aleck-y for their own good. But more often than not, Double Dagger did things with such passion, humor and energy, these slight annoyances barely scanned. Plus, they were a band that got better with each release (see 2010's sharpened Masks EP for evidence), and 333 is once again no exception."

Drake),0.0,0.0,4.0,0.259,trap,7.7,"Despite being born of injustice, an air of victory hangs over Meek’s first full-length since he was released from prison. It captures an intensity that the Philadelphia rapper is known for and best at.","Meek Mill is now saddled with something bigger than himself. From the moment he helicoptered out of Pennsylvania’s Graterford Correctional Facility in April of this year after being imprisoned for a parole violation, he embraced his role as a poster child for criminal justice reform. “It’s a shame that model probationers can be immediately put back behind bars simply for missing curfew, testing positive for marijuana, failing to pay fines on time or, in some cases, not following protocol when changing addresses,” he wrote last month in a New York Times op-ed, imploring lawmakers to pass legislation granting reductions in probation time for good behavior.These concerns aren’t foreign to Meek’s music. All of his projects have told the story a man who, because of where he was raised, has never known true freedom. Yet he’s never made that case as passionately or comprehensively as he does on Championships, his first full-length since his release and the closest he’s come to sustaining the “1812 Overture”-intensity of his “Dreams and Nightmares (Intro)” for an entire album. “Invisible shackles on the king, ’cause shit, I’m on bail/I went from selling out arenas, now shit, I’m on sale,” he raps on “Trauma,” one of several righteously operatic numbers tying black incarceration to the legacy of slavery.As always, Meek Mill raps with a level of buy-in that few of his peers could muster even in their imagination. On “What’s Free,” an impassioned flip of Biggie’s “What's Beef,” Meek launches a valiant defense of not only his character but his humanity. “Two-fifty a show and they still think I’m sellin’ crack,” he raps. “When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts/Tell him how we fundin’ all these kids to go to college/Tell him how we ceasin’ all these wars, stoppin’ violence/Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it.” Though the track is marred by Rick Ross, who muddles its message with a repulsive, sub-Eminem homophobic quip about 6ix9ine in prison, it closes with a grand finale: a bravado, 50-bar JAY-Z verse that stands among his meatiest ever.Up until now, every Meek Mill album has been several shades less entertaining than it should have been, as the rapper’s fired-up screeds inevitably gave way to a dreary parade of grievances. Championships finally breaks that curse. Despite being born of injustice, an air of victory hangs over most of the record and that jovial spirit carries through many of its guest spots. Cardi B raps exclusively in flexes on “On Me,” a rowdy number cut from a distinctly “Bodak Yellow”-esque cloth, while Drake returns to bury the hatchet over a tipsy Wheezy beat on “Going Bad.” Meek lands an especially good feature from Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA on “Uptown Vibes,” a reggaeton-spiked update of the cheery champagne rap of Camp Lo’s Uptown Saturday Night.The success of Championships is all the more impressive given the market pressure on Meek to make a very different kind of album. His last few radio hits have come not from locker-room-igniting anthems, but rather a string of soggy, sleepy R&B tracks that have been poorly matched with his human-megaphone routine. Thankfully, save for the limp “Almost Slipped” (where he shares the groaner “relationships turn into situationships”) and this summer’s hit “Dangerous,” redundantly reprised from his Legends of the Summer EP, Championships avoids that trap. Mostly the record commits to what he does best: substantial rap with clear stakes and an uncommon sense of purpose. After a career marked too often by botched opportunities and wasted potential, Meek Mill has finally risen to the moment."

After a splashy, very public relationship with the singer Ciara, the two had a splashy, very public breakup that spilled from the courts and onto Twitter. In its wake, Future measured his pain into cups of codeine-spiked soda and poured it all over his music, most notably on 2015’s Dirty Sprite 2. Dudes who lived vicariously through him dredged up all sorts of relationship trauma in order to wail alongside him, once more with feeling.After DS2’s 4 a.m. drive through the desert, Future cartwheeling back into the heart-clutching love songs and sweet-street persona of his 2012 debut, Pluto, might have been jarring. But nobody stays in beast mode forever, and FUTURE, the companion piece to HNDRXX, showed a few cracks in his hardened facade. Heartbreaks heal, especially when you’re a Romeo rapper with an R&B bedside manner and an unending supply of Vicodin. Over a well-played hand of wistful, bright-eyed and reflective beats, HNDRXX strikes a near-perfect balance between a man still licking his wounds and a man emerging from a long, dark night.That’s not to say there isn’t a little bumpiness upon re-entry. For all of us who missed the old Future—that “Turn on the Lights” Future, that love-you-down-in-the-sheets and buy-you-a-new-Range-for-the-streets Future—HNDRXX’s opener “My Collection” is a bit of a mind fuck. Over a wispy lullaby of a beat that sounds like more like an outro than an intro, Future peels off bills before asking, “You wanna come to Pluto?” Yes! Unfortunately, he lapses into light shaming of Ciara’s sexual history before the cringe-worthy declaration, “Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection.”A trio of standard-issue songs follows, filled with flossy verses flush with cash, cars, designer namedrops and a couple funny lines (“I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes,” he says in “Lookin Exotic”; “Baby mama back drinking liquor/Now she tryin’ to fuck my life up” in the DJ Mustard-produced “Damage”). The Weeknd’s sniveling on “Comin Out Strong” aside, these all blur together.But redemption comes on the ghostly “Use Me.” One of Future’s gifts is imbuing his voice with such emotion that lyrics become putty in his hands. As shadows flit across the wall, the plaintive refrain of “use me” is made all the more gut-wrenching when he belts it. By the time an organ warbles onto the song, he’s spent, his heart wrung dry. The shivery chorus begins to fade, and birds start chirping. It’s chilly, but dawn has finally broken, and somebody's cooking Nayvadius breakfast this morning."

It’s an ambitious, detail-rich record that splits the difference between streaming fodder and world-building. The rappers featured here are either aging out of the spotlight (Future), transitioning into corporate avatars (Travis Scott) or, unfortunately, serving time behind bars (Young Thug, Gunna). While Heroes & Villains scans as an opus of psychedelic trap and star-laden singles with cool comic book packaging, it almost feels like a last triumphant gasp from the past decade’s most prominent rappers and their favorite hitmaking producer.But Heroes & Villains proves that Metro aspires to more than hits. He first demonstrated his wide-scale vision on 2018’s Not All Heroes Wear Capes, a project in which his sparse, moody beats grew thicker, grander, and more intricate. When he attempted to swerve from his signature sound, though, his limited range was exposed: Metro is great when he makes Metro-type beats, shaky when he ventures outside of his comfort zone. On Heroes & Villains, he surpasses his standard quota of bangers while also taking a few fun risks. A symphonic, Francis and the Lights-esque intro? Why not. An interpolation of Mario Winans’ “I Don’t Wanna Know,” featuring the Weeknd and 21 Savage? Let’s do it. Metro is thinking outside the box a bit more, without sacrificing the foundation of what makes his music so appealing in the first place.Chief among these appeals is his ability to mine grade-A material from his guests. His beats are distinct enough to sound good on their own, yet understated enough to afford a vocalist stylistic freedom. Few artists melodically thrive over a Metro beat like Don Toliver, who delivers two of the album’s more magnetic vocal performances on “Too Many Nights” and “Around Me.” Even Future’s got a little pep in his step here, particularly on the anthemic “Superheroes (Heroes & Villains).” But it’s Young Thug, on “Metro Spider,” who steals the show. Slithering over a menacing string note and ominous piano, he snaps off a string of vivid, eccentric bars about luxury watches and feeling more famous than the president. Unlike other Thug verses that have emerged since his incarceration, “Metro Spider” hardly feels like a leftover—in fact, Metro positions it as the album’s centerpiece."

YHLQMDLG, released in March, flirted with the top of the pops and dominated the Latin charts; he’s graced awards-show stages and the covers of Western media’s storied publications; he’s evolved into a vocal ally of marginalized communities, with a willingness to acknowledge and rectify his mistakes; and with the release of El Último Tour Del Mundo, he’s made history with the first-ever No. 1 Spanish-language album on Billboard’s album chart. No other artist had more Spotify streams in 2020.For El Último Tour Del Mundo, Bad Bunny transports himself a decade into the future, imagining the music he’d play on his final world tour in 2030. It’s not his best record, but that’s almost beside the point. You’ll still find vestiges of his particular nuevo reggaetón sound on tracks like “Te Mudaste” and “Dákiti,” even if the latter is one of its weakest examples, pummeling the dembow riddim into submission with a thumping four-on-the-floor that’s devoid of any actual flavor. But by track four he takes a sharp left turn from the rap and perreo that defined previous LPs in favor of a morose, introspective vibe that pulls from British post-punk and the rock en español of Central and South America as much as it does the hip-hop and R&B of the American South.For better or worse, El Ultimó Tour Del Mundo’s rock sound leans heavily on producer Marco “MAG” Borrero (and, to a lesser extent, Borrero’s human riff machine Mick Coogan), best known for crafting pop hits for the likes of Flo Rida, Bebe Rexha, and Selena Gomez. The collaboration doesn’t always work; tracks like “Te Deseo Lo Mejor” and “Antes Que Se Acabe” suffer from a saccharine sound that’s generic enough to blend in with Top 40 radio. But when it does, it’s sublime. “Yo Visto Así” and “La Droga” inhabit the same universe of distorted emo rap as the late Lil Peep and Juice WRLD, with grunge guitars ringing out over rumbling trap beats. And “Maldita Pobreza,” a poor man’s lament that effortlessly bounces between buoyant new-wave riffs and booming 808s, evokes Café Tacvba, New Order, and modern-day traperos in equal measure, offering a glimpse of the brilliance that can result from Benito’s experimentation."

His skill as a curator helps sculpt a sticky, humid, psychedelic world with dazzling production and odd pleasures at every turn.","“Who put this shit together? I’m the glue” declares Travis Scott on Astroworld, and it’s hard to think of a more accurate summation of his aesthetic approach. The 26-year-old is an avatar for a generation of playlist-making curators who have positively embraced “creative” as a job title. He’s risen to mainstream rap prominence by way of pure tastemaking, exerting the au courant currency of borrowing exactly the right talent at exactly the right time since the hybrid hip-hop of his 2015 debut, Rodeo. Depending on a variety of factors—age, genre predilections, level of active investment in the myriad intersections between popular culture and social media—Scott’s artistic approach can come across as inspiring or infuriating, but it’s also proved undoubtedly successful.He’s wielded his own influence over areas of pop culture—Drake’s 2017 “playlist” More Life was arguably as influenced by Scott’s revolving-door A&R approach as it was by the evolving fluidity of the album format—even as he remains indebted to mentor Kanye West, whose titanic 2013 album Yeezus (to which Scott contributed) was its own ultra-collaborative, cut-and-paste monster. If Yeezus embraced by-committee creativity as a means to an end, Scott has taken it several steps further by allowing such an ethos to define his very artistic being. This has, of course, made him a divisive figure in hip-hop circles and elsewhere. A 2015 Deadspin post titled “Travis Scott Is Worse Than Iggy Azalea” made the case for Scott as a canny cultural plagiarist—a notion that became somewhat more fortified the following year, when he was accused of essentially stealing the framework for the Young Thug and Quavo collaboration “Pick Up the Phone” from Thug himself.The album that song appeared on, 2016’s Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, captured Scott in the process of refining the rougher edges of his sound, with bolder hooks and a slow tilt towards streamlined song structures. But last year’s full-length collab with Migos member Quavo, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, felt driftless and tossed-off by comparison, suggesting a weird paradox embedded in his career thus far: For someone so reliant on others to properly perfume his own work, Scott seems to be most engaged when he’s able to solely take credit for it.Such is the case with Astroworld, unquestionably his strongest release to date. The album takes its name from a since-shuttered amusement park in his hometown of Houston and often resembles a humid day spent at a carnival: sticky, sweet, bustling with activity, and packed with cheap thrills that still feel a tad overpriced. As far as trippy-sounding hip-hop goes, Scott is operating at something of a gold standard here, out-hallucinating fellow stylist A$AP Rocky’s own recent blotter-blotted efforts. “Psychedelics got me goin’ crazy,” he lolls over the spooky and beautiful “Stargazing,” his voice sounding like a sentient iTunes visualizer as he nods to Houston legend Big Moe and shouts out Ellen DeGeneres. It's the epitome of the Travis Scott experience."

It was produced by Rich Costey, who has worked with Muse and Foster the People, and though it has been framed as a new beginning, little of Kintsugi gives the impression that Gibbard’s motivation to reboot Death Cab is matched by legitimate inspiration.","Chris Walla quit Death Cab for Cutie last year, which means he will never again be called the band's ""secret weapon."" His nuanced craftsmanship served as a buffer against Ben Gibbard’s increasingly broad and bland songwriting on recent LPs Narrow Stairs and Codes & Keys, but Walla ""long[ed] for the unknown"" and Gibbard felt the band was becoming stagnant and ""self-referential"". Though Walla contributes guitar and electronic collage to the band's eighth LP Kintsugi, he abdicates the producer’s role for the first time in the band’s history—in his stead is a proper big-budget pop guy, the preposterously and perfectly named Rich Costey (Muse, Foster the People, Chvrches). But it wouldn’t have mattered if DJ Mustard or Steve Albini produced Kintsugi: as with Codes & Keys, Gibbard promises reinvention and continues to play against his strengths without developing new ones.Gibbard’s desire to write from a less personal standpoint is understandable, considering the widespread misunderstanding that any song in the first-person has to be autobiographical—his private life is a matter of public record these days, and surely he’s grown tired of having to clarify that wasn’t him eating Thanksgiving dinner in a suburban Denver Catholic church after dad bounced or treating that girl from Silver Lake like complete shit. But even when Gibbard was clearly writing in character, the sketches were personalized, and therein lay the genius of his work—he had an uncanny ability to see things as others might, penning deeply felt and detailed lyrics, willing to risk certain sentiments and awkward phrasings to reward the listener with a richer, more complex and relatable experience. They were someone’s stories. This is why Death Cab for Cutie played the KeyArena in Seattle and not, say, Matt Pond PA or Rogue Wave or any of their other peers from the ""O.C. indie"" era.But Gibbard's change in approach hasn't coincided with a change of subject; Death Cab for Cutie has not developed a political conscience, nor is Gibbard suddenly experimenting with tone poems. The same relationship breakdowns and travelogues captured on The Photo Album have gone big screen as Gibbard strives for universal, one-feel-fits-all songs meant to be shared but not owned. Take ""Little Wanderer"", where the narrator (not Gibbard, y’all) is stuck at home and the girl is showing him pictures of her very commonplace vacation spots (Tokyo and Paris) through Messenger. Gibbard knows how to wring pathos out of long-distance relationships; he invented a damn word for it. He can also tease out how technological improvements in communication can leave even more unsaid. And yet, here’s the chorus: ""You’re my wanderer, little wanderer/ Off across the sea/ You’re my wanderer, little wanderer/ Won’t you wander back to me?"" It’s startling, almost amusing, to hear a hackneyed line like that cutting against the stonefaced sobriety of his delivery and plangent reverbed guitars—every pejorative stereotype of Death Cab becomes true for four minutes."

Here he's trying for something even more grand, but the trouble with big leaps is that they can come with precipitous drop-offs.","In 2010, George Lewis, Jr. released Forget, a small and evocative synth-pop record dotted with sense-memory details: ""Here’s all I know/ Your checkered room and your velvet bow/ Your Elvis song in my ear,"" he crooned. The record was a success, but Lewis seemed impatient with the smaller-scale stardom it brought, and made his hunger for bigger stages plain in interviews. On his 2012 follow-up Confess, he upped the stakes, projecting in a booming, testosterone-rich voice over massive pop-rock tracks. It was a self-consciously spectacular pop record, and it solidified Lewis as someone eager to make Big Statements.It’s easy to root for artists with this drive—the bedroom-to-stadium leap, when it goes right, is thrilling to witness, and major statements (and artists’ desires to make them) are a large part of what makes following music so worthwhile in the first place. The trouble with big leaps is that they can come with precipitous drop-offs, and on Eclipse Lewis plummets, hard, into a valley of deep ridiculousness.Lewis’s influences have always felt rooted in '80s pop radio, when thundering drum machines and vocal overdubs stormed the Earth. On Eclipse, the sound edges into the twilight of '88, a moment when power ballads like Chicago’s ""Look Away"" ruled the airwaves. The dewy piano of ""Alone"", coupled with Lewis’s echo-drenched vocal, summon unwelcome memories of Richard Marx’s ""Right Here Waiting"". As he did with Confess, Lewis produces, and on Eclipse he pushes everything so far to the brink that it all tips over. The album sounds like the work of Ron Nevison, whose late-'80s work for Damn Yankees and Jefferson Starship set a new standard for what it meant to sound ""overblown.""On Confess, Lewis gave us an outsized performance of masculinity that felt slippery, or at least self-aware, and a lot of that complexity lived in the dynamics. The choruses were massive, but the verses were taut and punchy, and the two worked in tandem. On Eclipse, that nuance is mostly erased, as is nearly any dynamic marking south of ffffffff. Most of the album is delivered in a triumphal shout. The chorus of ""To the Top"" punches the top of the mix so hard that there is almost nothing left to feel except stunned, and it carries a dangerous whiff of Dirk Diggler performing ""You’ve Got the Touch"".Lewis dials back the volume once or twice on Eclipse, and each time it’s a welcome reprieve. ""Old Love/New Love"" is a legitimately sexy, fluid dance-pop song, marked out with a side-chained four-to-the-floor pulse and house pianos. The big, blocky synths of ""When the Lights Turn Out"" are slightly reminiscent of '80s Jam & Lewis, and Lewis’s voice is light and pretty above them. It might have a slight whiff of aerobicizing to it, but it’s sincere, and it’s possible, if you squint, to imagine it playing alongside One Direction (a huge compliment, in this case).Playing next to One Direction is Lewis’s goal, and he is admirably focused and direct about it. ""I hate when people that are definitely in the indie world posture themselves as pop stars when they lack the ambition, practice, and craft of someone who is at the top of their game in pop,"" he told Pitchfork in January. His disdain is rooted in a competitive impulse to swim with the big fish—he has also submitted material for Chris Brown and Eminem—and Eclipse, which is also his first album on Warner Bros., is his bid to join them. But the music feels wedged between weight classes—too ridiculous to be indie rock and too ponderous and generic for Top 40 pop. Say this for Eclipse: It doesn’t miss by half measures."

Last year, the Sheffield quartet’s Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not became the fastest-selling debut album in UK music history, spawning two No. 1 singles and winning the Mercury Prize. The band's early press clippings, like those for Gnarls Barkley, Lily Allen, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, highlighted their rapid netroots success story as much as their music, which is a traditionalist brew of observational storytelling, post-Libertines meat-and-potatoes guitar rock, and the heady enthusiasm of youth.Fifteen months later, Arctic Monkeys’ sophomore effort is already receiving a royal welcome at home, though the premature use of words like “comeback” underscores the precariousness of the group’s situation. As for the Arctics, they’ve come back tougher, sharper, and bleaker, even if to non-fans of this brand of no-frills Britrock it probably still sounds pretty much the same. Favourite Worst Nightmare is in some ways better and in other ways worse than its breakthrough 2006 predecessor, but above all it’s the assured statement of a self-conscious young band determined to deserve their acclaim. Eventually, maybe they will.In interviews, singer and lyricist Alex Turner stays low-key about his abilities. “You never think, like, ‘We’re amazing, aren’t we?’,” the 21-year-old recently told Mojo. Nevertheless, Favourite Worst Nightmare flexes Arctic Monkeys’ considerable songwriting and musical muscle with a confidence that sets the group apart from their UK rock peers; the latest songs seem to glimpse the possibility of greatness even when they fail to attain it. Turner finds new emotional depth on songs like breakup anthem “Do Me a Favour,” which climbs patiently from baggy drums to a searing, guitar-led crescendo. Gradually shifting from the man’s perspective to the woman’s, he concludes, “How to tear apart the ties that bind?/Perhaps ‘fuck off’ might be too kind,” his raggedly bereaved croon adding Damon Albarn to the list of plausible vocal comparisons alongside Morrissey and Noel Gallagher. Similarly, the drum-less and bass-less “Only One Who Knows” is another big step forward for the band, taking a more deliberate, atmospheric view of a dying relationship: “They made it far too easy to believe/That true romance can’t be achieved these days.”If such heartache is a fresh addition to Turner’s songs, so too, it seems, is the feeling that makes the pain possible. Real affection glimmered through the bickering on the debut’s “Mardy Bum,” but the girls on that album are mostly fake-tanned participants in meat-market mating rituals (“I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,” “Still Take You Home”). By contrast, Favourite Worst Nightmare unveils one of Turner’s first proper love songs: The closing “505,” draped with an apparent Ennio Morricone organ sample, poignantly if none too adventurously describes Turner’s longing to get back to a hotel room where his lover awaits. “I’m always just about to go and spoil the surprise/Take my hands off of your eyes too soon,” Turner admits, displaying his usual gift for vivid imagery."

The music was also confrontational, with lead singer Karen O following in the footsteps of countless riot grrls and righteous rock queens in crafting a persona of raw defiance and sexual menace.Fast-forward six years, and a glance at the instantly iconic cover of the band's third full-length, It's Blitz!, tells you all you need to know about how far the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have come, from Fever to Tell through the middle-ground growing pains of 2006's Show Your Bones and up to today. A clean, simple image of a woman's hand bursting an egg-- it's no less powerful an indication of feminine strength and defiance than Fever's abrasive scrawl, yet it's miles and miles more subversive. It's also a fitting symbol for its music, taking familiar shapes and tools and recombining them in ways that are bracing and unexpected.It's Blitz! is constructed from parts that by themselves aren't extraordinary-- in fact, many of them are quite banal, like the generic Franz-Bloc-Killers modern rock riff that propels ""Dull Life"" or the doomy one that drives ""Shame and Fortune"", sounding ripped straight off a late-period Smashing Pumpkins record. Much has been made of the album's heavy reliance on rock's eternal bugaboo, the synth, but often the synths are doing rock things rather than dance things, like on the buzzing, road-burning opener ""Zero"". Only two songs, ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"", deliver real disco backbeats.With these unremarkable tools, however, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs still create great, compelling pop-rock, largely because of the way the songs themselves are organized, with conventional verse-chorus structures repeatedly eschewed in favor of detours, miniature grooves, and lengthy asides that produce the sensation of a band and a singer impulsively following their own emotional whims. Take the lovely, insinuating ""Soft Shock"", for instance-- it starts with tinkly keyboards and an Far East-sounding melody that builds to a refrain utilizing the words in the song's title, but it isn't the song's emotional climax, which is hidden until later, when Karen worriedly intones ""what's the time, what's the day, gonna leave me?"" Even more compositionally jarring are the slow, stretched-out set showcases ""Skeletons"" and ""Runaway"", the former taking a blippy little electro-ballad and then plopping martial drums and a melody that sounds taken from some Scottish battle hymn smack dab in the middle. In keeping with the arty tendencies that have blossomed within the band from the beginning, these songs often feel portioned out into passages or movements as opposed to flowing organically throughout.With such an absence of easy signposts, we're especially apt to follow Karen wherever she goes, since she's our only hope for a guide. Yet she refuses to be a locus of explanation or control, keeping her lyrics generally vague and frequently losing herself in bursts of incomprehensible excitement or fervor. These fits and embellishments account for most of the best moments on the album-- the way she breathlessly pants ""crying, crying, crying"" on ""Zero"", or giddily draws out the last syllable of the line ""a hundred years old"" on ""Dull Life"", or how ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"" periodically dissipate into an inchoate softness.The ninth song on Fever to Tell was ""Maps"", a fleeting glimpse of vulnerability on an album of gleeful scorn. On It's Blitz! that slot is occupied by ""Hysteric"", a song every bit as emotionally naked and immediately indelible as ""Maps"". Here though, it represents an island of piercing clarity and happy convention in a sea of bewilderment, impulse, and ecstasy."

Funny band name, funny sound, funny masks, and a funny (and incredibly fun) hit called “Da Funk,” found on their debut album, Homework. They’ve come a long way since, but the playfulness remains, and so does their ability to surprise. Every new step in their career, whether positive (the landmark Discovery, their life-altering pyramid live shows), negative (the inert Human After All, their forgettable score for Tron), or somewhere in between (the film Electroma) has been met initially with a collective sense of puzzlement: “Now what’s this all about?”Random Access Memories, the fourth proper studio album from Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, continues the trend. But the differences between their first three albums and this one are vast. RAM finds them leaving behind the highly influential, riff-heavy EDM they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early ’80s. So we get a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic. It’s all rendered with an amazing level of detail, with no expense spared. For RAM, Daft Punk recorded in the best studios, they used the best musicians, they added choirs and orchestras when they felt like it, and they almost completely avoided samples, which had been central to most of their biggest songs. Most of all, they wanted to create an album-album, a series of songs that could take the listener on a trip, the way LPs were supposedly experienced in another time.Daft Punk, in other words, have an argument to make: that something special in music has been lost. You can’t have an argument without a thesis, and they start the album with one called “Give Life Back to Music.” The song’s opening rush brings to mind “old” Daft Punk, but then come percussive guitar strums courtesy of Nile Rodgers followed by orchestral surges. From the jump, it’s clear that the particulars of the sound are important. In a strictly technical sense, as far as capturing instruments on tape and mixing them so they are individually identifiable but still serve the arrangements, RAM is one of the best engineered records in many years. If people still went into stereo shops and bought stereos regularly, like they did during the era Daft Punk draw from, this record, with its meticulously recorded analog sound, would be an album to test out a potential system, right up there with Steely Dan’s Aja and Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Daft Punk make clear that one way to “give life back to music” is through the power of high fidelity."

The understanding that youthful innocence is a potent force-- a theme first established in ""Time to Pretend""-- continues throughout the record. Instead of the ""Knights of Cydonia"", though, MGMT fights ""Weekend Wars"", ostensibly an ode to the fictionalized childhood battles that treat backyards as independent colonies in need of conquering. The gentle, chiming melody and effete vocals of ""The Youth"" recall Sparks or Queen at their most restrained moments, and ""Kids"" comes across as an inspirational dance anthem for playgrounders.Most impressive on Spectacular is Vanwyngarden and Goldwasser's ability to dabble, with the shared understanding that whatever they do is Big.

""4th Dimensional Transition"" augments its cavernous psychedelic vocals with a jacked-up BPM count, and on ""Electric Feel"", MGMT pull off lithe, falsetto electro-funk surprisingly well.

But their attempts at topicality are clumsy.","“Can you say Sellout The Man?” griped one fan in a YouTube review of Portugal. The Man’s latest album, one of a handful compiled for posterity by the band themselves in a supercut of their own bad reviews. It’s a criticism the band had clearly braced for. Months before Woodstock’s release, they pre-butted that attack with shirts reading, in all caps, “I Liked Portugal. The Man Before They Sold Out.” Even without that caps-locked heads up, the band’s embrace of modern-rock glitz and EDM bombast shouldn’t have come as too much of a surprise. The Alaska psych-pop group had been telegraphing their commercial ambitions for years, first by signing to Atlantic for 2011’s In the Mountain in the Cloud and then by partnering with Danger Mouse on 2013’s streamlined Evil Friends. Those aren’t things bands do when they’re hoping to stay under the radar.Evil Friends was too little distinguished from any other album with Danger Mouse on it to move the needle much. With Woodstock, however, Portugal. The Man have finally made good on whatever latent commercial potential Atlantic saw in them. The band topped the alternative charts this summer with the single “Feel It Still,” a shimmying throwback built from borrowed pieces of the Marvelettes’ “Please Mr. Postman,” with more than a little inspiration from Pharrell’s “Happy,” and that peppy breakout track is no fluke. Recorded with an expanded cast of studio hands including familiar faces like John Hill, one of Santigold’s ace producers, and Danger Mouse—who returns for three tracks, one of which features a Gorillaz-style cameo from Fat Lip of the Pharcyde—Woodstock is sharper, catchier, and craftier than its predecessor. If it’s a shameless sellout record, it’s an effective one.Still, for fans who enjoyed the band’s messier edges, Woodstock’s origins make it hard not to fantasize about the album that might have been. In a significant departure for a band that fired off their first eight albums at a one-a-year clip without overthinking them, they spent years working with the Beastie Boys’ Mike D on a sprawling, nearly completed record titled Gloomin + Doomin before scrapping it for this one. The inspiration for their course correction, frontman John Gourley has explained repeatedly, was a speed-it-up pep talk from his father and the discovery of his dad’s old Woodstock ticket stub, which he says triggered the band’s desire to make a more charged record that spoke to the times."

After all, what Strokes fan wouldn’t want to believe this band’s spotty recent output was the result of a long-dormant period and not because, you know, they all hate each other and have a dozen other projects they’d rather focus on? And what better time to launch their comeback than a holiday marked by great expectations and even greater partying?The New Abnormal, the Strokes’ sixth album and first in seven years, mostly just feels like a hangover. It’s sluggish and slight, and the strongest hooks are so familiar that they require additional writing credits for the ’80s hits they copy note-for-note (Billy Idol’s “Dancing With Myself” in “Bad Decisions,” Psychedelic Furs’ “The Ghost in You” in “Eternal Summer”). Of course, the Strokes have never been subtle with their references—that’s part of the fun—but they’ve become increasingly uninterested in the tight, classic songcraft that once felt entirely their own. With producer Rick Rubin, a presence so hands-off as to feel merely symbolic, their signature sound is rendered as background music, a set of bleary-eyed mood pieces, all hovering around the five-minute mark before fizzling out with a shrug.A generous read is that it’s a style they have never attempted before: pushing their songs to their limits, maintaining a state of Zen in their machinelike interplay. In the nearly 20 years since Is This It, the Strokes have never quite found a way to successfully expand on their blueprint. There are the loungey, drum-less ballads you can expect to find about halfway through all their tracklists (“Ask Me Anything,” “Call Me Back,” this album’s first single “At the Door”). And then there are the proggy, metallic experiments that Casablancas now seems content to channel through Voidz, a project he has plainly admitted is where his passion lies. Historically, neither mode has led to anyone’s favorite Strokes songs. And so the best moments on The New Abnormal, like the genuinely pretty “Ode to the Mets,” feel like a step in the right direction. When everything locks into place, it’s like watching an old pinball machine light up, one level at a time."

Last year, the Sheffield quartet’s Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not became the fastest-selling debut album in UK music history, spawning two No. 1 singles and winning the Mercury Prize. The band's early press clippings, like those for Gnarls Barkley, Lily Allen, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, highlighted their rapid netroots success story as much as their music, which is a traditionalist brew of observational storytelling, post-Libertines meat-and-potatoes guitar rock, and the heady enthusiasm of youth.Fifteen months later, Arctic Monkeys’ sophomore effort is already receiving a royal welcome at home, though the premature use of words like “comeback” underscores the precariousness of the group’s situation. As for the Arctics, they’ve come back tougher, sharper, and bleaker, even if to non-fans of this brand of no-frills Britrock it probably still sounds pretty much the same. Favourite Worst Nightmare is in some ways better and in other ways worse than its breakthrough 2006 predecessor, but above all it’s the assured statement of a self-conscious young band determined to deserve their acclaim. Eventually, maybe they will.In interviews, singer and lyricist Alex Turner stays low-key about his abilities. “You never think, like, ‘We’re amazing, aren’t we?’,” the 21-year-old recently told Mojo. Nevertheless, Favourite Worst Nightmare flexes Arctic Monkeys’ considerable songwriting and musical muscle with a confidence that sets the group apart from their UK rock peers; the latest songs seem to glimpse the possibility of greatness even when they fail to attain it. Turner finds new emotional depth on songs like breakup anthem “Do Me a Favour,” which climbs patiently from baggy drums to a searing, guitar-led crescendo. Gradually shifting from the man’s perspective to the woman’s, he concludes, “How to tear apart the ties that bind?/Perhaps ‘fuck off’ might be too kind,” his raggedly bereaved croon adding Damon Albarn to the list of plausible vocal comparisons alongside Morrissey and Noel Gallagher. Similarly, the drum-less and bass-less “Only One Who Knows” is another big step forward for the band, taking a more deliberate, atmospheric view of a dying relationship: “They made it far too easy to believe/That true romance can’t be achieved these days.”If such heartache is a fresh addition to Turner’s songs, so too, it seems, is the feeling that makes the pain possible. Real affection glimmered through the bickering on the debut’s “Mardy Bum,” but the girls on that album are mostly fake-tanned participants in meat-market mating rituals (“I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,” “Still Take You Home”). By contrast, Favourite Worst Nightmare unveils one of Turner’s first proper love songs: The closing “505,” draped with an apparent Ennio Morricone organ sample, poignantly if none too adventurously describes Turner’s longing to get back to a hotel room where his lover awaits. “I’m always just about to go and spoil the surprise/Take my hands off of your eyes too soon,” Turner admits, displaying his usual gift for vivid imagery."

Each amplifies the other’s songwriting, enriches the detail, and heightens the emotion.","The steadfast devotion between the women of Boygenius is a subject worthy of a dog-eared literary classic, one that’s passed from friend to friend until the pages come fluttering off the spine. In 2016, Julien Baker spotted Lucy Dacus reading Henry James in the green room of a venue and felt an immediate affinity; the two became friends and developed mutual, unspoken crushes as they wrote each other lengthy correspondences online. A month later, a similar kinship transpired between Baker and Phoebe Bridgers, who traded favorite authors and poets in their own email thread. They were three young singer-songwriters of shrewd sensitivity, tentatively navigating early-career acclaim; “Things were happening for us all at the same time and I think we’ve gravitated to each other,” Baker has said. Cut to 2018, when they got booked together on a triple bill and headed into the studio, thinking they’d record one song. They emerged with six. By all accounts, making that initial Boygenius EP was an ineffable experience, the consequence of which should not be diminished through careless simile: “It was not like falling in love,” Bridgers states. “It was falling in love.”It’s not just that Boygenius poke fun at the degree to which male artists are lionized—in the EP artwork imitating Crosby, Stills, & Nash; their recent recreation of Nirvana’s 1994 Rolling Stone cover; and the new album’s working title contenders like In Rainbows and The White Album. It’s not just that their commitment to making music together pushes against the competitive forces of patriarchy, in the same spirit as women-led supergroups from Wild Flag to the Highwomen. It is that the three women seem to actually love each other, as expressed on their long-awaited debut album, ultimately titled The Record. It’s a kind of love that rejects the ingrained impulse for women to route their emotional, spiritual, and erotic attention away from their peers and toward men—what the feminist poet Adrienne Rich diagnosed in a famous essay—but also troubles the commonly accepted division between romance and friendship. Boygenius are teammates, confidantes, soon-to-be onstage make-out partners; the songs on The Record are largely for each other, about each other, littered with inside references.This time, Dacus, Bridgers, and Baker bring in the best guys in the business: Jay Som’s Melina Duterte on bass, Autolux’s Carla Azar on drums, Illuminati Hotties’ Sarah Tudzin as engineer, and Catherine Marks on co-production. The Pulitzer-nominated novelist Elif Batuman wrote the introductory essay; Oscar-nominated actress Kristen Stewart directed three Boygenius music videos. Boygenius embrace how we are always responding to and being formed by others, and how this porousness can enrich our lives. As they wonder on the album’s opener, in braided unison: “Who would I be without you, without them?”"

In fact, those forward trajectories are made up of millions of tiny spirals—routines followed, patterns performed, habits fallen into. Most days are slightly deviating copies of one another, with periodic breaths of novelty. On their debut full-length, Jinx, New York City psych-rock band Crumb give shape to the ambivalence and hypnosis of those lulling spirals, bending indie rock and jazz influences to shape a clear-eyed perspective tinted amber with dirt. Beckoning the listener with dreamy keyboards, twinkling guitar, and a recognizable buzz of stoic anxiety, Jinx rewards with the promise that within the dizzying haze are moments, turns in direction, worth waking up to.Crumb formed in 2015 while the group’s members attended university in Boston, and their first, self-titled EP realized songs that guitarist, vocalist, and lead songwriter Lila Ramani began writing as far back as high school. Crumb and 2017 follow-up Locket, both misty and meandering, cast the four-part group as the new kid on today’s jazz-influenced psych block, among bands like Tame Impala and King Krule. On Jinx, those free-jazz influences and arrangements—an affinity Ramani also flexes as a member of New York City experimental collective Standing on the Corner—remain, but there’s something decidedly murkier afoot. Embracing the analog-suffused production they dabbled in on past projects, Crumb’s debut offers a warm, hazy snapshot of banal existence from the inside out.Concealed emotion, strained facades, and the desire to break free from the numbness underlying both are recurring themes, but Jinx is no dense, depressing slog. Languid love song “Ghostride” sets a scene of passive action as Ramani, voice wavering at a dispassionate hum, observes her subjects moving through the world on autopilot. A moment of hope emerges as guitar and drums break to a higher register and she breathily sings, “Come on now/Don’t let this go/Don’t let the light fade away/People come/And people go/But I—.” With a shade of hesitancy, she cuts off the sentiment, not finishing until the chorus repeats with the final word, almost a pronouncement: “stay.” That longing for cloud-parting connection and devotion peek out through the album’s rises and falls.Crumb have a knack for entrancing the listener, only to then displace them with airy, twinkling release. Flashes of silence—abruptly muted guitar strums, complete rests—and Ramani’s penchant for spell-like repetition can warp time, one hallucinatory spiral suddenly interrupted by another, more promising one. The album’s hypnotic quality grows ever more romantic and tense with repeat listens, a prescient-feeling experience that matches a zeitgeist: strung-out maintaining in the face of impending doom. “This city is dense/And it makes me tense/And it makes me tense/And it never ends/And it never ends,” Ramani sings, her voice recessed by a gauzy filter, on “And It Never Ends.” How do we get off the eye-glazing treadmill of the day-to-day? In lieu of tidy answers, Jinx offers a sympathetic fellow witness to the mystery.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Weekend are making lucid, pop-conscious moves.","When you release a record like Sports, the 2010 debut from San Francisco ex-pats Weekend, the smartest thing you can do is tour the hell out of it. Tapping into a strain of noisy, shadowy post-punk, it succeeded largely because of its texture. Carried on waves of serrated guitar, it was not only bracingly cathartic on headphones, but captivating, malleable, and very loud on the stage. Weekend did wisely tour it extensively, recording only a five-song EP,  Red, in the three years since. Some of the material on Red reflected the image of a band whose ears might need a break; though it still sounded like the work of the guys who gave us Sports, it hinted at a cleaner, glossier update of their sound.On their second LP, Jinx, Weekend are still working with a strong palette of blacks and grays. But where Sports' only light was the mineral glint of smeared charcoal, Jinx has a reflective, acrylic gloss to it. Expanding from a trio to a four-piece after hiring bassist Nick Ray, frontman Shaun Durkan moved his band to Brooklyn in the wake of a family death that found him seeking therapy. Still bleak, but surprisingly spirited and indebted to new wave, this newfound clarity and change of scenery has had an impact on the band: Weekend have put together a record that's begging to be played to more ears in bigger spaces. Like their arena-goth forebearers the Cure and Depeche Mode, they're making lucid, pop-conscious moves, focusing on melody and cleaner sonics to contrast the doubt, melancholy, and occasional tenderness already present.During Jinx's hook-minded first half, Weekend nearly pull off the transformation. With its buoyant low-end and surprisingly straightforward guitar work, opener and first single ""Mirror"" is an obvious indication of Weekend's commitment to reshaping their sound. While the torrents of noise are missed, Durkan and company prove that they have the songwriting chops to make up for it. ""July"" is a step further in the right direction, managing to capture the balmy freedom of summer's favorite month without alienating what could be the track's core constituency. It only takes a few listens for choruses to open up, with ""Oubielete"" pulling off a rare trick in that it sounds like a lost 1980s college radio staple that, despite not having been heard in years, feels like it never went away. (You could say the same for the big-beat anchored ""Celebration, FL"", but it's more likely thanks to the fact that it just sounds like a really bummed-out cover of ""Just Can't Get Enough"".)"

Ascending mediocre bands to heights of unwarranted popularity, and smacking the truly great down to ""critics' pet"" status, hype has become a plague on any band hoping to achieve unbridled adoration among music elitists. When the media hounds smell success and respond with their annual cry of ""saviors of rock and roll,"" disappointment is inevitable. So it goes with the Strokes, a band that's seen enough publicity in 2001 to make bin Laden jealous.Touted by the press as ""the forefathers of a bold new era in rock,"" ""the greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones"" and ""the second coming of the Velvet Underground,"" the Strokes have nowhere to go but out of style. And the album only came out last week! So why all the fanfare? Are they really that good? Of fucking course not. There is no bold new era in rock; the Rolling Stones have yet to be contended with; and if there ever is a second coming of the Velvet Underground, they won't be doing second-rate imitations of Lou Reed.The Strokes are not deities. Nor are they ""brilliant,"" ""awe-inspiring,"" or ""genius."" They're a rock band, plain and simple. And if you go into this record expecting nothing more than that, you'll probably be pretty pleased. See, while I can't agree with the Strokes' messianic treatment, I'd be lying if I said I thought Is This It was anything other than a great rock record.What's refreshing to me about the Strokes is that, in a musical climate where even the dirtiest garage bands can create the illusion of million-dollar studio techniques through sound filters on mom's Packard-Bell, the Strokes prefer to rock in the classic vein: no laser sounds, no ethereal reverb, no pre-programmed Aphex beats. Their influences are so firmly rooted in the post-punk tradition that it's as if the last two decades had never occurred. The same names are always dropped: the Velvet Underground, Television, the Stooges. And while the Velvets are obviously a major source of inspiration, the Strokes' only similarity to Television and the Stooges is the confidence with which they play.Frontman Julian Casablancas' vocals bear more than a passing resemblance to early Lou Reed, but where Reed seemed to accidentally dispense life-changing lyrics through a drugged drawl, Julian sings about the simple trivialities of big-city life with stark lucidity. These songs revolve around frustrated relationships, never coming near to approaching anything that might resemble insight. Yet, with Casablancas' self-assured, conversational delivery, and the almost primal energy of the four guys backing him, attention shifts from the simply present lyrics to the raging wall of melody these guys bang out like it's their lifeblood."

H.E.R.),0.0,1.0,7.0,0.808,modern,7.3,"On his debut album, Toronto R&B singer Daniel Caesar looks to gospel for a roadmap to the complexities of romantic love.","Daniel Caesar knows gospel. Twice on Freudian, the Toronto R&B singer folds in interpolations of well-known gospel songs: On “Hold Me Down,” he refashions the familiar melody and wispy soprano of Kirk Franklin’s “Hold Me Now” into a testament to romantic loyalty, and a few songs later, on “We Find Love,” he does it again with Kyle David Matthews’ “We Fall Down.” These instances are more than merely Easter eggs for gospel music fans; they’re also emblematic of the synergistic relationship between gospel and R&B, which Caesar embraces throughout his debut LP.The line between the two genres can be thin: Their similar tempos and lyrical themes lend themselves to interchangeability (see, for instance, the shift from Musiq’s “Love” to Trin-i-Tee 5:7’s “Lord”). It’s no surprise many singers have dabbled in both. In Caesar's world, love is a holy experience sullied by human imperfection. As often as he basks in the beauty of romance, he repents at the altar of a broken heart, performing with an unflashy sincerity more in line with spiritual offerings than R&B melodrama.Freudian opens with his breakout single “Get You,” a saccharine honeymoon-phase jam featuring Kali Uchis.  “Best Part,” which features H.E.R. is equally dulcet. The warmth of those two songs stands in stark contrast to a song like “Loose,” a poetic vent about letting go that’s backed by celestial organs and is reminiscent of one of Frank Ocean’s interludes. Similarly, the piano-driven ballad “Blessed” finds Caesar trying to make amends for his shortcomings (“Yes I’m a mess but I’m blessed to be stuck with you”). His cottony voice, complete with falsetto flourishes, adds emotional depth to his lyrics.On past projects, Caesar has generally worked alone, but with Freudian, a number of key collaborators help bring the album into focus. The features are a who’s who of female artists remaking soul music in their own images: Kali Uchis’ retro groove, Syd’s chilly futurism, H.E.R.’s updated traditionalism, and Charlotte Day Wilson’s folksy elegance. Providing balance to Caesar’s narrative, they serve as the subjects of his fawning and the elusive lovers to whom he atones. The quiet heroes, though, are CaDaRo Tribe, the go-to choir throughout Freudian. The trio offers its angelic vocals on five of the six songs without features, each time to different effect. On “Neu Roses (Transgressor’s Song),” they lay down throwback street-corner harmonies (complete with the infamous nayhoo). On “Hold Me Down” and “We Find Love,” they’re the melodic foils that make the samples work. Together, the generous spread of women’s voices makes the album feel like a continuous conversation across the seasons of a relationship rather than a one-sided musing."

No, we’re producing here, this is the concept, I’mma put you on this ... Put this here, do that there, say this line instead of that line ... It’s levels to it.” The implication is that a producer is hands-on where a beatmaker is not, and has a greater impact on the song’s direction without necessarily playing on it, in an almost advisory role. That seems to be an important caveat for his new album, Poison, which bills him as a lead artist despite the fact that he rarely raps and made only half the beats.Poison was culled from a massive backlog and whittled into a curated rap relic. It was made in a series with four other projects: an R&B album, an “energy” album for “motivation,” an “acoustics” album that’s “just vibes” and “for Sundays,” and a “global” album featuring international artists. There was an early version of this album that featured Kanye West, Bono, and Bruno Mars, but a change of direction led him to pick these 10 songs out of 70 to make what he called the “East Coast Chronic.”For what it’s worth: Poison isn’t East Coast Chronic, or even close. That album was helmed by two titans at the peak of their powers delivering under colossal stakes. This one has far less vision, less focus, and no stakes whatsoever. It isn’t essential or transcendent. But the album doesn’t have to invoke the authority of one of hip-hop’s greatest monuments ever to be produced effectively and full of defining moments. Where else can you find Young Thug tighten up and barrel through the fidgety MPC programming of AraabMUZIK, or hear 2 Chainz two-step and swagger for Bink? The characters shuffling through these songs are worth following, thanks in large part to Swizz stepping back and letting the guests star, playing the role of director more than performer.With his 2007 solo debut, One Man Band Man, Swizz Beatz cosplayed as a rap star that, for some reason, almost exclusively rapped about being a rich producer. (His attempts to rap about anything else were disastrous.) The idea that Swizz could do it all himself as a rap Swiss army knife was put to bed rather quickly. After more than a decade to reflect on that, Swizz has learned from his mistakes. His mic time declines exponentially from his first album to this one, with him mostly punching in for his typical hypeman duties or for a freestyled mini-verse or two. Those moments are still cringy but not insufferable, going on only long enough to be noticed and not long enough to become a nuisance."

Today we revisit a 1990 R&B blockbuster that bridged the gap between new jack swing and hip-hop soul.","They’d been talking about Bell Biv DeVoe for four minutes straight, and Ralph Tresvant was getting pissed. All six members of R&B group New Edition were back together, sitting on BET’s black leather “Video Soul” sofa for an interview, and these three guys who usually sang backup for Ralph—Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe—wouldn’t shut up about their little hip-hop side project.Tresvant decided to interrupt and set it straight. “Mike keeps stressing BBD—it’s not a BBD moment,” he said. “It’s a New Edition reunion.”This was 1990, and the trio’s debut single “Poison” was on the verge of breaking into the Top 10. Their album, also called Poison, had just dropped, and it was on its way to selling 4 million copies. By the end of the year, Billboard would declare BBD the biggest new pop group of 1990. It was definitely Bell Biv DeVoe’s moment.Poison was a conceptually groundbreaking pop album that reinvented the relationship between R&B and hip-hop for the ’90s. BBD even had a neat little mission statement to explain their vision: “Our music is mentally hip-hop, smoothed out on the R&B tip with a pop feel appeal to it.” They stamped the slogan on their album cover and flashed it on screen during their videos. They talked about it in every interview, including that day on BET. The show’s host wasn’t sure what to make of it: “And like...what does that mean?”Ricky Bell spoke up: “You have to listen to the music to understand what we’re talking about.”You’ve heard “Poison” too many times, probably at a wedding or a school dance or some perennially bad episode of “Carpool Karaoke.” But Bell Biv DeVoe is more than just a song, and their debut album represents a critical leap in the evolution of R&B. A collaboration with revered Public Enemy production crew the Bomb Squad, Poison embodied the style and sound of hip-hop in a more convincing way than any R&B album before it. For better or worse, Bell Biv DeVoe set the stage for three decades of singers who want to talk, dress, and act like rappers.Back when he was only 14, Michael Bivins introduced himself to the world with a little rap on New Edition’s 1982 breakout hit “Candy Girl”: “She walks so fast, she looks so sweet/She makes my heart just skip a beat.” The group made smiling, bubble-gum electro-pop, but Bivins had the cool confidence of a rapper, even if he was stuck singing background vocals most of the time. As New Edition grew from boys to men, embracing a sophisticated sound on their 1988 album Heart Break, Bivins was quietly establishing his hip-hop credibility."

SZA’s deeply personal lens on modern romance gives these songs endless life.","Originally titled A, the debut album from SZA was meant to conclude a trilogy of self-titled releases following 2013’s S and 2014 ’s Z—her official entré into the music world. The release date was originally projected for summer 2016 and, as she revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly at the time, it was going to be a frank recounting of her romantic life, warts and all. “I’m talking a lot of grimy shit, but it’s truth,” she said. In the year the album sat in the wings with her label TDE, the fearless style of her grimy shit fermented into a powerful R&B set piece that is unlike any released in recent memory.Over a lonely electric guitar riff on CTRL’s opening track ”Supermodel,” she sets the tone: “Let me tell you a secret/I been secretly banging your homeboy/Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?” This sorry setup isn’t fiction, either. In the same EW interview, she said that one of the songs on her album would be about her ex-boyfriend leaving her on Valentine’s Day while she slept with his friend as revenge. “[It] will be the first time he hears about it,” she said.Boyfriends and more, ahem, casual acquaintances are taken to task across the album, but this isn’t a pity party. CTRL is about sexual freedom while still having your hunger for intimacy be taken seriously. On the woozy “Doves in the Wind,” SZA sings about Forrest Gump—not a figure running through her mind like Frank Ocean—but the kind of guy who sees women as more than just their bodies and who “deserve the whole box of chocolates.” Born Solána Rowe, the Jersey singer seems to take comfort in the freewheelin’ Forrest Gump character Jenny Curran (on Z track “Warm Winds,” SZA quotes young Jenny’s “Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far away” prayer). But SZA finds solace in the sweetness offered to the adult Jenny by Forrest. That sentiment (without literal Gump references) bleeds through on tracks like the heartbreaking “Normal Girl,” about being unable to find a paramour who wants to take her home to meet his family, not just home to his bedroom. But when she sings, “I really wish I was a normal girl?” it’s a stinging reminder that with so many platforms to meet people, there are just that many more people to be hurt by. What if not finding an emotional connection means there’s something fundamentally wrong with you?"

Today we revisit Alicia Keys’ outstanding 2001 debut, a self-produced, Chopin-inspired R&B album that blazed a unique path to mainstream superstardom.","Alicia Keys had a near-complete version of her debut album, Songs in A Minor, in the summer of 1998 when her label, Columbia Records, decided she should go in a different direction. Yes, she was a classically trained pianist and the rare 17-year-old prodigy who sang, wrote, arranged, and produced her own music, but maybe she could play piano less and be more like, say, Christina Aguilera? Maybe she could lose a little weight and show some skin, too?“They wanted me, the tomboy from Hell’s Kitchen, to become the next teen pop idol,” Keys wrote in her memoir. The label had already brought in big-name producers to strip away the retro-soul sound that separated artists like Erykah Badu, D’Angelo, Maxwell, Jill Scott, and Keys from the stream of sex-driven R&B in the late-’90s. Keys found the recording process crushing and chose instead to partner with producer Kerry “Krucial” Brothers to create a dexterous blend of classical music and soul that merged young-adult melodrama with Beethoven. Columbia execs told her it sounded like one long demo.The label was, of course, laughably wrong. Keys left Columbia in early 1999 to sign with Clive Davis at Arista Records and later his new label, J Records, where she could pilot her own vision. By November 2001, she had a No. 1 album and Rolling Stone had crowned her “The Next Queen of Soul.” By March 2002, she’d gone five-times platinum and won five Grammys, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for her No. 1 hit “Fallin’.”Songs in A Minor arrived amid the birth of iTunes and the sensual empowerment of Destiny’s Child. Britney Spears and JC Chasez’s boy band were on their third albums, and Usher was gaining momentum for 8701, about to crush pop music off rock-hard abs alone. Then came Keys with her self-produced, Chopin-inspired compositions about self-worth, survival, and practical pursuits of happiness. She sang of profound love and desire, emotional and career stability. But this was also a dark time. Songs in A Minor spent a third week atop the Billboard charts in the same week that Aaliyah’s self-titled album bowed at No. 2—just before the singer’s death and a month before 9/11. Keys found herself at the center of a pop landscape where she and India.Arie became the new ambassadors of neo-soul.Keys’ accolades were much-deserved, but they were also rich with subtext. She was a biracial girl from New York who performed in crop tops and blazers and wore beads in her cornrows like Stevie Wonder. She subverted expectations of what a classical musician should look like in a genre associated with stately white composers in starchy suits. Keys played up the culture clash, often seeming to materialize on stage in leather Going Out tops, headscarves, and floor-length furs—and suddenly in front of a grand piano. On the intro of Songs in A Minor, “Piano & I,” she embraces her position as a star over an instrumental that builds from the operatic hum of Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata” to jolting drums. “I didn’t know I was here,” she says. “Do you know my name?”"

The 24-year-old won’t be found crawling on his knees begging for his ex back, or making sugary love songs for lifestyle-advertising mood boards or direct-to-Netflix rom-coms. If you listen to the dreamy soul of his new album Fuck the World long enough, it starts to sound like a horror story. In his world, sex is a game and there are no consequences for anything.Faiyaz is at his best when he’s cold-hearted, like Future minus the bleak outlook. “Rehab (Winter in Paris)” is unsympathetic from the opening line: “I got too many hoes/But they ain’t you,” he sings warmly over neo-soul ready strings and finger snaps—so warmly, in fact, that you forget that he’s actually telling the girl he’s supposed to be in love with that he’s sleeping around. The stripped-down, self-produced “Fuck the World (Summer in London)” is similar, with countless bars that make him sound like a demon (“Your nigga caught us texting/You said ‘Baby don’t be mad you know how Brent is’”) or stand out for the wrong reasons (on the hook he calls himself a “walkin’ erection”). Both songs are minimal in their approach, but layered, with small tweaks—like his slowed vocals on “Fuck the World (Summer in London)”—that elevate it all.It’s worth noting that Brent Faiyaz is a savant at caption-worthy one-liners—“I’d probably be dead if I was basic,” “If you ain’t nasty don’t at me.” But there’s more to Fuck the World than Faiyaz’s ability to provide content for fit pics. He’s remarkably consistent as a songwriter; the weakest point over 10 songs is “Soon Az I Get Home (Interlude),” mostly because of its brevity. On “Let Me Know” he shows off his sweet (and under-used) falsetto, adding a coating of earnest gloom: “Who can I love when they tell me I can’t love myself?/How in the hell, could I possibly love someone else?” he croons.True to Fuck the World’s title, Faiyaz spends most of his time shrugging, and his looseness separates him from his more self-serious R&B peers. The ethereal “Clouded” is an exception. For a moment, he wonders about his legacy: “Is anybody gon’ remember me?/If I go tonight I doubt the world would change.” Then, the moment passes, and he instantly returns to his comfort zone: too much sex, destroying relationships that aren’t his, and breaking hearts without remorse."

Some of Aiko’s most honest writing occurs here.","Grief is unlike any other life experience. It is the process of feeling the spectrum of human emotion all at once: unbearable sorrow combined with profound joy to have known this person, immense love coupled with blinding anger that they’re gone. The weight of grief threatened to buckle Jhené Aiko after she lost her brother Miyagi in 2012, but she turned to music for respite. She turned to spiritual enlightenment, and she turned to drugs. Trip is the culmination of it all, hazily floating over a hefty 22 tracks.As a concept album, Trip aims to translate the hallucinogenic highs of weed, LSD, and shrooms into sound. Befitting its length, these are highs that last for hours on end. The airiness of Aiko’s voice blends well into the spare, psychedelia-inspired productions courtesy of Dot Da Genius, Fisticuffs, and Amaire Johnson among others. Where her peers often drift towards dense electronica or hip-hop to inform their sounds and give them commercial appeal, Aiko keeps this music light and ambient, a space where she’s at her best. It’s all part of a larger multimedia project comprising an emotional short film, the album, and a forthcoming book of poetry. Aiko has completely opened herself up for this work, bravely mourning in public and exposing all the ways she tried and failed to do so in private. With that, Trip exists for its own sake and on its own terms; it’s a respectable undertaking, even if 90 minutes seems daunting. Trip is more committed to its narrative of self-discovery than churning out a hit, but there are a few potentials.While the skating rink groove of “OLLA (Only Lovers Left Alive)” is the album’s most ostensibly pop-facing moment, the Swae Lee-assisted “Sativa” is the immediate standout. Lyrically, it’s a sexy party hookup anthem (“Why you make it so complicated?/Off the drink, we concentratin’/I know you won’t leave me hangin’,” goes the hook), but it ends up feeling like that moment when you’re too faded to actually complete the mission. It is bittersweet euphoria. These two tracks are some of the more dynamic within an album that can feel a bit one-note at times. It generally does well as chilled-out background music, but it’s also worthwhile as a focused listen, as some of Aiko’s most honest writing shows up here.On “Jukai,” Aiko grapples with the concept of suicide, inspired by Japan’s Aokigahara forest. With “Nobody” and “Overstimulated,” she battles her demons of addiction. “Pop one, pop two, pop three, four pills/These things tell me how I should feel,” she sings on “Nobody,” convinced she can (or has to) handle her problems alone. “Overstimulated” captures the dizzying effects of stimulants like cocaine and Adderall, but there’s a seductive element in her lyrics that makes the high sound as fleeting as a noncommittal lover. Ultimately, all of this is built around the grief. Aiko’s constant search “for a brother’s love in every single man” ties into her hope that if she can just “get high enough,” she can reach him."

Today, we revisit Ja Rule’s fleeting moment in the sun, a chart-topping 2001 album whose magnetic pop crossovers foreshadowed the future of melodic rap.","It was 2002 and Ja Rule was irate. DMX had recently appeared on DJ Kay Slay’s show to accuse Ja of biting his style; 50 Cent was taking to diss tracks and interviews to castigate Ja for imitating 2Pac. He’d had as much as he could take. He called into Hot 97. “Everybody wants to make comparisons to Pac and X and me,” Ja shouted through the receiver and across the airwaves. “Y’all niggas wanna see Pac come back? … It’s here, nigga. It’s here.”It wasn’t. Because Ja Rule might seem like a relic of 2000s hip-hop whose career-ending beef with 50 Cent should probably be above the fold on his Wikipedia page, it’s easy to dismiss this bravado as posturing, a snarling burst of delusion from the co-founder of Fyre Festival. But in 2002, Ja tried with all his might to fashion himself as Pac’s rightful heir. Now the comparison is ridiculous, an example of Ja’s boundless self-regard, but back then it didn’t seem completely implausible that Ja could one day have an impact akin to Pac. It wasn’t just the bandana looped around his head, the manicured mustache, or the way he stretched his vowels and spit from the pit of his stomach. It was how his bluster contorted into anguish, how his arm-wheeling freneticism made him seem 10 feet tall, how he packaged brazen attitude into radio-ready rap hits. Emboldened by a string of chart-topping singles and a pair of No. 1 albums, Ja was on the Hot 97 airwaves that day battling for position as the biggest rapper on the planet, trying to bring down anyone who stood in his way. The Greek tragedy of Ja was already in motion.A year earlier, from the height of his cultural ubiquity, Ja released his third studio album, Pain Is Love. His beefs were still inconsequential; his label, Murder Inc., was still a reputable force in mainstream music. Like his hero Pac, he leveraged his success to start acting, landing a supporting role in the first installment of the soon-to-be commercial behemoth Fast and the Furious franchise. His culture-dominating duet with Jennifer Lopez, “I’m Real,” made him such a household name that MTV, after 9/11, asked him to share his thoughts on the tragic events—a moment that Dave Chappelle memorialized for its absurdity.Ja achieved massive popularity in part because his music appealed to female audiences, a demographic often ignored in ’90s and early ’00s hip-hop. His R&B-styled crossovers influenced his identity as a “sensitive thug,” someone whose loverman persona counteracted his hard-edged street side. Ja was one of the rare A-list rappers whose songs could pop off at a bar mitzvah or a block party, whose work elided clear distinctions between hip-hop, R&B, and pop. And considering the imminent Auto-Tune era and melodic rap boom, Ja’s stylistic choices now feel prescient, a forward-thinking maneuver that soon became standard across mainstream hip-hop. But back then 50 Cent and hip-hop writ large taunted Ja for his doe-eyed love songs, and he chafed against this archetype, not knowing it would help define rap for the next 20 years."

A window slices open, and smoke streams out of the car; diamonds “doing Toosie Slides in both ears” glimmer as he coasts down the Vegas strip. Drake, whom Faiyaz takes such pains to reference in this track and the rest of his catalog, perfected this kind of pitched-down plunge into nihilism, adrenaline as the only end game. But amid this impending sense of doom, Faiyaz charmed with an ethereal voice and compelling sense of ease.“Dead Man Walking” went viral across TikTok, and remains one of the most graceful songs of the Maryland R&B singer’s career. The single seemed to offer a more elegant, elevated posture for the guy who branded himself a “walking erection” on “Fuck the World,” the title track of his previous project. But Wasteland, his latest full-length, shows that he’s learned the wrong lessons from his viral success. On the new album, he opts for grandeur over granularity, resulting in an expensive, ambitious collection that relies on gimmicks and conceit. Instead of trusting Faiyaz to carry his own momentum, Wasteland is both overbearing and underbaked, smothering strands of lovely vocals and wisps of ideas underneath blockbuster features and irritating interludes.Faiyaz has said that he binge-watched Tarantino movies while making the album, and Wasteland is cinematic in the most clunkily literal sense. Three of the record’s 19 tracks are skits, and that tally doesn’t include the introduction—a swirl of menacing piano chords, crowd chatter, and fragmented intonations spoken by Faiyaz and Jorja Smith about tunneling into a high to escape and, gratingly, how Twitter has co-opted the word “toxic.” (“Shakespeare used it,” Smith chimes in, “The Taming of the Shrew.”) The two-and-half-minute-long ramble culminates in an intriguing, if not obvious question: “What purpose do your vices serve in your life?” But Faiyaz spends the next hour dodging the answer. Instead, we get a plot. Wasteland follows Faiyaz’s character as he deflects the looming responsibilities of fatherhood, lying to the pregnant mother of his future child until she is so distraught that she threatens suicide. In a painfully drawn-out scene, “Skit: Wake Up Call,” Faiyaz crashes his car speeding to see her. Between these awkwardly scripted data-dumps, we get some gleaming songs—the catchy, Tyler, the Creator-assisted “Gravity,” the tingling percussion on “Addictions”, the hazy thrill of “Dead Man Walking”—but Faiyaz shoves the listener back into the overwrought narrative before any of the hits can metabolize."

SZA’s deeply personal lens on modern romance gives these songs endless life.","Originally titled A, the debut album from SZA was meant to conclude a trilogy of self-titled releases following 2013’s S and 2014 ’s Z—her official entré into the music world. The release date was originally projected for summer 2016 and, as she revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly at the time, it was going to be a frank recounting of her romantic life, warts and all. “I’m talking a lot of grimy shit, but it’s truth,” she said. In the year the album sat in the wings with her label TDE, the fearless style of her grimy shit fermented into a powerful R&B set piece that is unlike any released in recent memory.Over a lonely electric guitar riff on CTRL’s opening track ”Supermodel,” she sets the tone: “Let me tell you a secret/I been secretly banging your homeboy/Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?” This sorry setup isn’t fiction, either. In the same EW interview, she said that one of the songs on her album would be about her ex-boyfriend leaving her on Valentine’s Day while she slept with his friend as revenge. “[It] will be the first time he hears about it,” she said.Boyfriends and more, ahem, casual acquaintances are taken to task across the album, but this isn’t a pity party. CTRL is about sexual freedom while still having your hunger for intimacy be taken seriously. On the woozy “Doves in the Wind,” SZA sings about Forrest Gump—not a figure running through her mind like Frank Ocean—but the kind of guy who sees women as more than just their bodies and who “deserve the whole box of chocolates.” Born Solána Rowe, the Jersey singer seems to take comfort in the freewheelin’ Forrest Gump character Jenny Curran (on Z track “Warm Winds,” SZA quotes young Jenny’s “Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far away” prayer). But SZA finds solace in the sweetness offered to the adult Jenny by Forrest. That sentiment (without literal Gump references) bleeds through on tracks like the heartbreaking “Normal Girl,” about being unable to find a paramour who wants to take her home to meet his family, not just home to his bedroom. But when she sings, “I really wish I was a normal girl?” it’s a stinging reminder that with so many platforms to meet people, there are just that many more people to be hurt by. What if not finding an emotional connection means there’s something fundamentally wrong with you?"

The best moments capture her soulfulness alongside her fury.","Summer Walker’s music has the emotional intensity of a Real Housewives reunion. Her songs are as shady as they are chaotic—and irresistibly entertaining. Yet beneath the drama are layers of vulnerability. Walker’s 2019 debut Over It positioned the 25-year-old singer as a star in the moody landscape of contemporary trap R&B. With her follow-up, Still Over It, she cements herself as one of the genre’s most relatable storytellers, with a keen ear for melodrama that eventually starts to become monotonous.Still Over It charts a journey through a messy and complicated breakup. Walker wants you to know she’s singing about her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child, noted Atlanta producer London on da Track. London not only contributes production to half of the album; he’s also the subject of Walker’s lyrical anguish. Her sadness and insecurities aren’t theoretical, and her songwriting is most powerful when she’s descriptive about the depths of that agony: “How could you make me spend my whole fucking pregnancy alone?”Walker and London aren’t the album’s only contributors, nor the only characters in its story. Opening track “Bitter” is a hazy stream of consciousness where Walker presumably addresses her social-media spats with the mothers of London’s other children (“So why you puttin’ on for The Shade Room and Insta?” she questions). The track ends with a voicemail from Cardi B, who advises Walker to “put that drama in your music.” Lead single “Ex for a Reason”—featuring City Girls’ JT and co-produced by Sean Garrett—shines with a sleek hook and bubbly production reminiscent of Garrett’s early-2000s hits. On the pop-infused “No Love,” Walker and SZA regret defending a man who isn’t worth it: “Tried to act like I wasn’t good enough in your eyes/Funny now that you callin’, that you ringin’ my line,” Walker sings.The turbulent narrative feels true-to-life, but as the album stretches toward 20 tracks, Walker struggles to find new angles that are equally as compelling. On the Neptunes-produced “Dat Right There,” she re-emphasizes her sexual prowess and brags about stealing other women’s boyfriends, a boast that feels a little sour coming after so much heartbreak. And on the closing “Ciara’s Prayer,” the titular singer leads us in an earnest appeal to Jesus to send her a deserving partner: “I pray the next man in my life will be my husband/I pray he loves me, leads me, guides me,” she recites. It’s an appropriate closer for a breakup album but an awfully old-fashioned plea.The best moments on Still Over It capture Walker’s soulfulness alongside her fury. Hers and Ari Lennox’s bluesy vocals pair with an alluring sax solo on “Unloyal,” one of the strongest R&B singles of the year. Another standout, “Screwin,” is a slow groove about toxic intimacy featuring Omarion, and “4th Baby Mama” shows just how searing Walker’s songwriting can get: “I wanna start with your mama, she should’ve whooped your ass,” she sneers, modulating her voice to deliver an unsparing critique. Walker understands her strengths as a storyteller, and on Still Over It, she’s at her most commanding when she sings for herself while evoking the pain of other women who’ve been hurt.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Ty Dolla $ign),0.0,1.0,8.0,0.367,modern,7.6,"The Oakland R&B singer’s latest project is a shining example of both her emotional intelligence and her balmy, lucid songwriting.","“Somebody out there really needs to hear this,” Kehlani stated, with earned conviction, on the first track of her second mixtape, 2015’s You Should Be Here. That four-word title alone revealed her emotional intelligence and extraordinary empathy—attuned to the injustice of family members who died before they should have, to friends lost, and to how lovers can be physically present even when they are already long gone. “I’ve felt more pain than some will in their entire lives, all before the age of even being able to buy a fucking drink in a bar,” Kehlani continued on You Should Be Here’s opening monologue, setting the stage and clearing the air for all the raw feeling that would follow.In her journey from a gauged-ear teen on “America’s Got Talent” to her current zen-like self—pop music sage, wellness app guru, “Come As You Are” tattooed above a portrait of Lauryn Hill on her left bicep—Kehlani, who is now 23, has spoken bluntly about her struggles with mental health and her difficult childhood, likening her parents to Bonnie and Clyde. But in an era of morbid sadness in pop and rap, Kehlani’s songs are tinged with optimism. “Piece of Mind,” the breezy highlight of her 2017 debut LP SweetSexySavage, was a poised anthem about regaining composure and self-worth after a psychologically fraught time. Kehlani’s music knows hurt, but its theme is survival.While We Wait is Kehlani’s fourth project: her third mixtape and first since SweetSexySavage. Fittingly titled, it was made during her pregnancy (Kehlani’s daughter is due in March) and is her strongest, most distilled release. The playlistification of mainstream music has not hindered this refreshingly concise collection of pop, rap, and ’90s R&B resilience. The sparkling self-respect jam “Morning Glory” evokes TLC, autonomy, and collectedness. The tape’s most thrilling single, “Nunya,” is like Kehlani’s savage take on “Bug A Boo,” with a monster hook to match its monster kiss-off: “You put on a show/’Cause you don’t want the world to know/That you lost the girl who got it on her own.” And the opener “Footsteps” is angelic neo-soul with the piercing emotionality of Joni Mitchell. “When I walked away/I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me,” Kehlani sings, a simply gorgeous sentiment about leaving a person even if you don’t want to.The nine songs on While We Wait sometimes feel like a scripted drama about just how complicated love and communication can be in our hyper-mediated present. Kehlani meets peers like SZA and Drake in illustrating those messy realities and then some, sifting through past traumas, suppressed feelings, the shortcomings of language, and the constraints of masculinity. Her primary characters are broken people with baggage attempting to understand one another: “Shoulda never gave you my heart on consignment,” she sings on the aching, moody break-up banger “Nights Like This,” and things grow harder from there. But Kehlani treads into these seas, looks for anchors, and does not shy away from the crashing waves. “I see you duck and dodge at every bend,” she whisper-raps on the spare, vulnerable “Butterfly,” insuring a partner that, “It’ll make you no less of a man/To break your walls and simply grab my hand.” All of Kehlani’s music—but none so much as While We Wait—feels like taking TLC’s “Damaged” and trying to heal it."

The drums build from a tribal romp to a panicked bubbling, rife with stealthy, undercover bass—the kind that unintentionally nods to a techno-master’s version of footwork. Jonny Pierce of the Drums swoops in to set the scene for a distant dystopian landscape, crooning with a combination of innocent yearning and pop-worthy sentimentality. That pop sensibility is solidified once a wave of dubstep bolsters his hook: “We gotta leave before we dieeeee.” On the surface the song feels like a relatively natural progression after Trentemøller’s 2010 Into The Great Wide Yonder, an album that benefited from these types of wide-reaching cinematics. Whether Trentemøller’s newest album’s successes are indeed its songwriting is another matter.The fact that more than half of the songs on Lost carry guest vocalists is surely a sign of something. Or, at the least, that this producer is looking to test the boundaries of his abilities in the indie-pop/rock sphere. Sometimes his knack for blending minimal techno and house works towards that, sounding both progressive and true-to-self. Other times, the DJ's innovation is lost in the mix. Take “Gravity”, an opening track which features Jana Hunter of Lower Dens. The song carries Trentemøller signifiers—a ping-ponging, bleepy synth pattern and minimal, plodding bass—but add Hunter and the singer’s haunting moans are immediately lifted into a swirl of psychedelic grooves. An enveloping of strings and a somber horn ballad sweep the track into becoming something that’s dictated by Hunter’s presence; “Gravity” is a perfectly fine Lower Dens track.“Come Undone” features Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and the producer’s role similarly becomes second-string to his singer. Perhaps it’s the distinct way Makino bends her melodies into syrupy moans, but “Come Undone”'s slow burn sounds like something that could have come from a futuristic, alt-universe issue of Misery Is A Butterfly. But then there’s “Deceive”, featuring the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner, where we see Trentemøller's behind-the-scene skills stretched to their greatness. What begins as an exercise in the dark techno he's especially great at becomes much more. A feverish, unhinged synth buzz resonates as the speed picks up, making Wagner’s whispers of treacherous love sound increasingly harrowing in the process—all the while, “Deceive” ends up as one of Lost's most danceable tracks.Needless to say, the straight instrumentals on Lost are where Trentemøller ’s technical prowess is highlighted. As Philip Sherburne mentioned in his review of The Last Resort, this is a man who “deftly fuses minimal techno, big-room house, and the itchy-scratchy fidgeting of IDM without sounding tokenistic.” Here the DJ stays true to this idea while leaping into other universes altogether. “Trails” unfolds as a krautrock stomp where crashing chimes and furious guitars take cues from Indian folk before hopscotching into a spacey laser-light show. (It's too bad he didn't pull Hunter onto something like this.) “Constantinople” jumps on a similar ship: a shrill accordion melody sampled from old Bollywood cruises through a bombardment of electric guitar and driving drums. Add the bass and the whole thing plays out like his own version of a wild jam session in a Turkish nightclub.It's worth noting ""Never Stop Running"" was released on vinyl, its B-side featuring the instrumental track of the song. Listening to it stripped of its vocals, there's no doubting that the clever structuring of epic dance-floor blends is one of Trentemøller's greatest strengths. ""Still On Fire"", for example, is a simply-presented industrial escapade with grunting reverb, gloomy singing synths, and the tinkling of a million percussive embellishments—yet it still manages to deliver an emotive punch. The question for the producer going forward is whether any of these strong, statement instrumentals are more restricted by or benefit from collaborative effort. Because sometimes he's better off dancing on his own."

SZA’s deeply personal lens on modern romance gives these songs endless life.","Originally titled A, the debut album from SZA was meant to conclude a trilogy of self-titled releases following 2013’s S and 2014 ’s Z—her official entré into the music world. The release date was originally projected for summer 2016 and, as she revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly at the time, it was going to be a frank recounting of her romantic life, warts and all. “I’m talking a lot of grimy shit, but it’s truth,” she said. In the year the album sat in the wings with her label TDE, the fearless style of her grimy shit fermented into a powerful R&B set piece that is unlike any released in recent memory.Over a lonely electric guitar riff on CTRL’s opening track ”Supermodel,” she sets the tone: “Let me tell you a secret/I been secretly banging your homeboy/Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?” This sorry setup isn’t fiction, either. In the same EW interview, she said that one of the songs on her album would be about her ex-boyfriend leaving her on Valentine’s Day while she slept with his friend as revenge. “[It] will be the first time he hears about it,” she said.Boyfriends and more, ahem, casual acquaintances are taken to task across the album, but this isn’t a pity party. CTRL is about sexual freedom while still having your hunger for intimacy be taken seriously. On the woozy “Doves in the Wind,” SZA sings about Forrest Gump—not a figure running through her mind like Frank Ocean—but the kind of guy who sees women as more than just their bodies and who “deserve the whole box of chocolates.” Born Solána Rowe, the Jersey singer seems to take comfort in the freewheelin’ Forrest Gump character Jenny Curran (on Z track “Warm Winds,” SZA quotes young Jenny’s “Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far away” prayer). But SZA finds solace in the sweetness offered to the adult Jenny by Forrest. That sentiment (without literal Gump references) bleeds through on tracks like the heartbreaking “Normal Girl,” about being unable to find a paramour who wants to take her home to meet his family, not just home to his bedroom. But when she sings, “I really wish I was a normal girl?” it’s a stinging reminder that with so many platforms to meet people, there are just that many more people to be hurt by. What if not finding an emotional connection means there’s something fundamentally wrong with you?"

The 24-year-old won’t be found crawling on his knees begging for his ex back, or making sugary love songs for lifestyle-advertising mood boards or direct-to-Netflix rom-coms. If you listen to the dreamy soul of his new album Fuck the World long enough, it starts to sound like a horror story. In his world, sex is a game and there are no consequences for anything.Faiyaz is at his best when he’s cold-hearted, like Future minus the bleak outlook. “Rehab (Winter in Paris)” is unsympathetic from the opening line: “I got too many hoes/But they ain’t you,” he sings warmly over neo-soul ready strings and finger snaps—so warmly, in fact, that you forget that he’s actually telling the girl he’s supposed to be in love with that he’s sleeping around. The stripped-down, self-produced “Fuck the World (Summer in London)” is similar, with countless bars that make him sound like a demon (“Your nigga caught us texting/You said ‘Baby don’t be mad you know how Brent is’”) or stand out for the wrong reasons (on the hook he calls himself a “walkin’ erection”). Both songs are minimal in their approach, but layered, with small tweaks—like his slowed vocals on “Fuck the World (Summer in London)”—that elevate it all.It’s worth noting that Brent Faiyaz is a savant at caption-worthy one-liners—“I’d probably be dead if I was basic,” “If you ain’t nasty don’t at me.” But there’s more to Fuck the World than Faiyaz’s ability to provide content for fit pics. He’s remarkably consistent as a songwriter; the weakest point over 10 songs is “Soon Az I Get Home (Interlude),” mostly because of its brevity. On “Let Me Know” he shows off his sweet (and under-used) falsetto, adding a coating of earnest gloom: “Who can I love when they tell me I can’t love myself?/How in the hell, could I possibly love someone else?” he croons.True to Fuck the World’s title, Faiyaz spends most of his time shrugging, and his looseness separates him from his more self-serious R&B peers. The ethereal “Clouded” is an exception. For a moment, he wonders about his legacy: “Is anybody gon’ remember me?/If I go tonight I doubt the world would change.” Then, the moment passes, and he instantly returns to his comfort zone: too much sex, destroying relationships that aren’t his, and breaking hearts without remorse."

As the reality TV program has gained popularity, major Korean record labels have become more willing to invest in burgeoning rap stars instead of the typical idol or group. XXX’s Kim Ximya, who raps on top of production by the duo’s other half FRNK, has suggested that the commercialism of Korean rap has killed the authenticity of the genre, as it increasingly mirrors the formulaic nature of K-pop. “For most of the Korean rapper population, I feel they did not write about what they actually felt or what they were actually doing,” Kim said in an interview with Billboard. “They were making music they thought people would like to hear.”On their debut album Language, XXX present themselves as the alternative to the sanitized, hyper-glossy rap music typically pumped out by the billion-dollar Korean music industry. If BTS are measured and subtle about their politics, XXX cuss in two different languages to get the point across. Kim launches invectives against the corporate K-pop machine, money-thirsty rappers, and oppressive standards of “success” (as defined by capitalism). He’s at his best when he’s absolutely seething with rage—a refreshing mode of delivery that doesn’t appear often in K-pop’s biggest hits.“Y'all wanna know what the fuck hip-hop is?” Kim spits with vitriol on “S_it,” before he answers his own question: “Such luxury does not exist in Korea.” And although Kim’s intermittent English lyrics are sometimes clunky, they help non-Korean speakers get a sense of the themes he’s tackling here. It works best in “Sujak,” when he starts off by rapping in English: “Strip club/Casket/Body in that basket.” Kim charges the song with nihilistic energy before switching over to Korean to elaborate on living in a soul-sucking society that values money over people. It seems almost utilitarian, like how other K-pop stars add in random English interjections in order to appeal to as many international listeners as possible. But his bilingualism is more impressive in the moments when the shift is seamless and the two languages flow together, like when he rhymes Korean words with English ones and vice versa.While Language repeatedly takes aim at the overwhelmingly high pressures of the Korean music industry, Kim’s rage never becomes monotone or boring. His frustrations are nuanced, as he portrays his internal conflict of wanting to succeed within the system that he’s actively trying to fight. On “Ugly,” Kim admits that he ascribes his self-worth to his success as an artist. “This ranking system and poverty is fucking my mentality/In the end, my music doesn’t reach the charts,” he raps. And on “What You Want,” he illustrates how easy it is to find himself slipping back into the capitalistic ethos. His train of thought begins to unravel: “Art is human/Human is greed/Ergo greed is money.” He snaps himself out of the cycle and starts over, until he inevitably finds himself talking about money yet again."

Bryndon Cook has always understood this. From his first gig as a wide-eyed college kid on the road with Solange to his work on Blood Orange’s Freetown Sound, he’s fit right in with his contemporaries on the bleeding edge where style rises above the runway. And with Starchild & the New Romantic, we’re finally getting to see his own vision take center stage.Cook—a graduate of SUNY Purchase’s renowned acting conservatory and a former intern at Pitchfork—looks most comfortable performing, and when he’s under the big lights, it shows. It’s why Dev Hynes asks him to dance in his videos and lay down tracks for his Blood Orange project, and why Solange and Chairlift’s Patrick Wimberly trust him to bring their music to life on stage.But while he’s been in high demand as a hired gun in the studio and on the road, it’s been a bigger challenge to refine his own voice. Cook has been releasing music as Starchild since at least 2012, but Language is his first LP. A slick, colorful foray into ’80s-influenced funk, it’s the most forceful expression of his identity on record to date, the reflection of an artist of immense talent and a strong command of musical history. Cook’s bona fides are not in question. His burden is to find himself among the genius he surrounds himself with, to communicate something original with the tools left to him by his forebears.It’s a story as old as black music in the Americas: the blues bars injected with the energy that birthed rock and roll, the mining of old records for the samples and breaks that became hip-hop. Cook’s Language speaks to that history, both musically and spiritually. Much of Starchild’s outward expression—from the P-Funk-inspired name down to the MJ dance moves—feels like a nod to the greats. As a producer, he wields nimble guitar licks, bouncy brass, and bleating organs with equal aplomb, and appears to share Prince and Sheila E’s affection for the LinnDrum. It’s the aesthetic of someone who knows his history and aims to be included among his heroes.On Starchild & the New Romantic’s 2016 EP Crucial, Cook departed from the synthed-out rap&B vibe of 2012’s Night Music EP, offering a glimpse of the universe he was building. Language feels even more grown, relating political struggles to his own hopes and dreams. “Hangin On” reads like a letter to the late Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader assassinated on his own driveway in front of his family. “Saw you in my sleep/Chased you ’til morning came/My mama said ‘Follow your dreams’/Well I guess you were my warning,” he sings, weighing hope against the reality of what happens to black people who stir the pot. The song’s video elicits specific images of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, itself created to bridge the generation gap between Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the young students who represented the future of the civil rights movement."

When Drew Taggart and Alex Pall released “#SELFIE” in December 2013, they were relative nobodies trying to make a dent on the EDM scene. A month later, Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak label picked up the single—a novelty song about social media that suggested women are somehow more vain and annoying than men—and things started happening for the duo. But, like the viral spread of Baauer’s “Harlem Shake,” the success of “#SELFIE” and its attendant backlash threatened to eclipse their fledgling career.“We made a novelty record that was, in my opinion, one of the most clever records ever made... Obviously not everyone got the joke,” Taggart told Idolator in late 2015, gravely underestimating everyone's ability to get jokes. “But we’re working our way out of that and proving that we’re pretty well-rounded musicians.” So they abandoned their EDM to emphasize slower tempos, slinky melodies, and songs about bruised feelings. Whether they helped initiate the move away from super-sized dance music or merely sniffed the shifting winds, it was a canny move. In the past year, they have become one of the biggest names in pop music. On YouTube, a pair of videos for their single “Closer”—a moody, surprisingly convincing song about sex, regret, and the passage of time—has been viewed 1.6 billion times. Their 10 most popular songs on YouTube and Spotify alone account for a combined seven billion plays.This stylistic and emotional maturation is a big part of the narrative the Chainsmokers tell about themselves as party bros made good. The first lines we hear on the album are an apology: “You know I’m sorry,” sings a wounded, suspicious Taggart, sounding more like an emo singer than a superstar DJ, and it sets the brooding tone for an album preoccupied with breakups and betrayals. Musically, Memories… Do Not Open is of a piece with all of their output post-“Roses,” the single that marked their big shift. There are no big-room bangers, no concussive drops, no coked-up-mosquito-with-a-vuvuzela synth riffs. Diplo and Skrillex’s big hit for Justin Bieber, “Where Are Ü Now,” serves as the template for their pneumatic pads and processed vocals. With few exceptions—like “Break Up Every Night,” a peppy pop-rock number that could be a more caffeinated MAGIC!, or “Last Day Alive,” which features the country duo Florida Georgia Line in the musical equivalent of a poster of fighter jets—the duo and their 32 credited co-writers keep the tempos slow and the moods muted. It is an anodyne pop record for a post-EDM world, one where trap and trop-house mix with pale imitations of the Migos flow and Coldplay’s cornball sentimentality. None of it sounds anything like “#SELFIE,” but its worldview is barely any bigger than that song's narrow perspective; toggling between cheap thrills and bitter recriminations with all the emotional stakes of a drunken beach fight caught on Snapchat."

Other big time producers from, Afrojack to Zedd, make mostly humorless music. Their drops and major keys work for clubs of course, with huge dynamic shifts that play to the pit of your stomach the same way a roller coaster does. The genius of them is they also work for partying on a smaller scale, like for at-home pregaming. EDM’s lack of subtlety isn’t a fault—it’s the entire point. For the genre, you can often replace questions of “good” and bad” with “useful” or “useless.” EDM is a tool as much as it is a type of music. DJ Snake has taken EDM’s inherent grandeur and played around in its sandbox. “Turn Down for What,” especially, turned the dial past eleven. Its over the top aggression is written into its rhythms. The song has Lil Jon barking at you. It’s ludicrous, and excellently so. After billions of of plays, it’s still not old, as it well overshoots its modest ambitions. In other words, at his best, DJ Snake under-promises and over-delivers.Unfortunately, we don’t get much of DJ Snake at his best on Encore. Clearly DJ Snake has the ability to make some serious earworms: “Sahara,” with Skrillex, adds an element of surprise, in the form of tablas and chanting. It’s got a predictable buildup and inevitable drop, before some very “Turn Down” esque synth jabs take over. It’s dumb fun. “Ocho Cinco,” the album’s most successfully ridiculous track, mostly eschews vocals (like “Sahara”) and utilizes what basically sounds like a nail gun for most of its drums. It sounds appropriate for driving your car into a wall. Same with “Propaganda,” which follows a similar formula of exuberant pummelling.But instead of just riding out that vim and vigor, he looks to make a real album, more songs with choruses and verses. Why? There’s a fish with a bicycle comparison to be made here. The album is simply not the format for DJ Snake. The conventional song barely is. He makes tracks. Instead of being, at least, a collection of great, standalone singles, the album is riddled with ill-advised rap songs and bad ballads. At best, “Let Me Love You,” the collaboration with Justin Bieber (who knows his way around silly EDM beats) is forgettable. Jeremih, on “The Half” sounds half awake on the beat’s video game bloops. Closer “Here Comes the Night” with Mr. Hudson is actually pretty good in that slick Ryan-Gosling-movie-credits way. But how a clunker like “Future Pt 2” with limp vocals from Bipolar Sunshine ended up next to these songs is anyone’s guess. Can no one working on these records tell how bad they are?Ultimately, the question that remains with Encore is really just: Why does this exist? The party tracks on here are exceptional at doing what they do. The guy can make a banger. Surely those songs would have the life they deserve on computer screens and in subwoofers however they’re released. The “Turn Down for What” video has half a billion YouTube views! It’s digestible. In what way does an uneven album help DJ Snake or his fans? Is his ambition to be a producer and songwriter? It probably shouldn’t be. No one needs these wet noodle ballads. They’re inoffensive, sure, but they’re completely unnecessary. Not sure what made him turn down."

America loves a tale of redemption almost as much as one of comeuppance, but at the start of the decade you'd have gotten pretty long odds on the media and cultural elite spinning the Marshall Mathers yarn as the former before the latter. And yet, somewhere between hugging Elton onstage at the Grammys and sending that guy in the Pistons jersey to pick up his Oscar, Em was feted by many of America's best-known cultural crits, columnist, and pundits: Frank Rich, Andrew Sarris, Maureen Dowd, Greil Marcus, Neal Gabler, and Paul Slansky (among others) either laid garlands at his feet or rhapsodized about the supposed transformation of the rapper/actor.The epistolary weepie ""Stan"" and the survivalist self-helpisms of ""Lose Yourself"" played a part in the slow mainstream media embrace of Eminem, but it's that ""slash"" that seemed to complete the embrace. For whatever reason, a film career can do that-- maybe it's the ability for a lengthy narrative to be more explicitly mutli-dimensional or maybe it's just lazy thinking and knee-jerk reactionary assumptions about pop, but you're now as likely to see Em torn down on Vibe than The New York Times Magazine.Well, Maureen, Andrew, and Greil, get ready to be excited; most of the rest of you-- the ones who've been held enthrall by Em's complex games of shifting his identity, challenging hypocrisy, baiting liberal guilt, and spitting deft rhymes with his labyrinthine flow-- prepare for disappointment: Encore is a fourth fascinating record from Eminem, but it's also easily his weakest and, in many ways, tamest album to date.Eminem's reaction to respectability seems to have been to move in two different directions: introspection and reconciliation on the one side, and bodily fluid-obsessed humor on the other. Tracks in which Em offers confessions, explanations, and apologies for previous comments and his participation in high-profile beefs share time here with belching, farting, vomiting, and urinating. He's also scrubbed his lyrics of homophobia (instead, the fascinating and eyebrow-raising homoeroticism hinted at on The Eminem Show-- and literally fleshed out in his music video cross-dressing-- colors a handful of his songs here) and, save a few blasts at Kim, any elements of misogyny.Therefore, if Encore is anything, it's a transitional record. After an image-confounding trio of pseudo self-titled records, the Eminem of Encore is wounded and weary; he's removing the layers of meta, still laughing and nodding but rarely winking, and not disappearing behind what The Village Voice's Frank Kogan once labeled Em's lyrical ""trapdoors and escape hatches."" Instead, the LP is the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games, and often seems to be rapping only to entertain himself with little regard for any potential audience. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Despite the album's pronounced maturity/infantilism divide, it's a different dichotomy that characterizes the album's highlights: Here, Em is at his best when he's either more focused than even before or at his most scattered and playful. Unfortunately, most of the tracks that don't veer toward either extreme are plodding and unremarkable."

On In My Mind, his first major-label release, he doesn’t sing as much as he coos, adoringly, at the object of his affection, whose identity is renewed in each song. He might bring on current rappers like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, and Big K.R.I.T., but the real wellspring of his inspiration is Chicago soul music, and on In My Mind he both honors and renews the classic form.Tenderness is as inherent to Chicago soul music as the bass drop is to EDM, and BJ is surpassingly tender here, but that doesn't mean he's shy. Some of the tracks on In My Mind are so overtly sexual they could redden a teenager's ears. The adult and NSFW ""Love Inside,"" for instance, is not about someone being beautiful on the inside, à la Bruno Mars. It is about uncensored intimacy, as is ""Resume,"" ""Church,"" ""The New Cupid,"" ""Woman’s World,"" ""Heart Crush,"" and ""Turnin’ Me Up"". That’s almost half the album.These songs represent the best of In My Mind. Sledge is in the zone when he’s singing to women, about women, and especially in praise of women, as he does on ""Woman's World."" A clever inversion of James Brown’s ""It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World"", the track features Sledge doing his best Smokey Robinson impression atop doo-wop tones and a frenetic, electronically rendered string section.It’s one of the highlights on In My Mind, alongside ""The New Cupid,"" in which Sledge laments what he sees as a lack of romance infecting his generation. Above a mellow sampling of Raphael Saadiq’s ""Oh Girl,"" Sledge wonders where Cupid has gone, before ultimately deciding that he must be ""too busy at the club."" It’s up to Sledge, then, to play matchmaker, because ""without a love song, something’s gonna go way wrong."" Both in subject matter and style, the song is similar to fellow Chicagoans Carl Thomas’ stunning but slept on single, ""Don’t Kiss Me,"" and R. Kelly’s saccharine ""When a Woman Loves.""On ""Turnin’ Me Up,"" Sledge enumerates the ways in which his lover satisfies his every need over an ever-thickening beat. On ""Church,"" the woman Sledge adores is determined to ruin his Sunday. It’s Saturday night and she wants to ""drink, do drugs, and have sex,"" and she doesn’t care that Sledge has to go to church in the morning. As Chance the Rapper says in his slick guest verse, ""She always say, 'hey, I don’t wanna be saved.'"" It's an interesting dynamic for a soul song: The woman is the protagonist, and the listener learns more about her likes and dislikes than Sledge’s. She is self-assured in her hedonism, happy to be the devil perched on Sledge’s quivering shoulder.Sledge is a very straightforward lyricist; he doesn't stunt, he yearns. His lyrics favor plainspoken confessions over catchy turns of phrase, and when the album falters, it's because his words reduce a pair of lovers to their mouths and hands.  Tracks like ""Man Down"" and ""Crazy"" make clear that Sledge is at his worst when he tries to reinvent the R&B wheel. He knows too well what goes into a great soul song to be able to dismember it. He’s too much of a traditionalist, stubborn in his devotion to Chicago soul music and its unpretentious approach to sex, love and everything that happens in between."

So one’s got to wonder, with that pedigree, why the hell Pharrell would leave his longtime partner out of the production process for his debut solo album, In My Mind? The dark curls and eccentric lazers in the Neptunes’ music have always been attributed, at least in part, to Hugo. One listen to Kenna’s overlooked 2003 post-new wave album New Sacred Cow-- produced entirely by Hugo-- reveals the evil synths and cold kinetics he brings to Williams’ airy theatricality and bougie Turks & Caicos yacht-rap.Without that dark core, Pharrell is left to focus expressly on the bouncy and bounce-able. Not that there’s anything wrong with his brand of quasi-philosophical, brazenly materialistic music-- see Jay-Z’s ""I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)”, for example. But stretched over the course of 16 songs, with few contributions from those who owe him for part of their success, leaves a moist, spoiled aftertaste. It’s all pizzazz, no pathos.Granted, there are impressive moments: The arresting “Keep It Playa”, featuring Slim Thug, features some rattling snares and a familiar series of guitar plucks that rumbles into a hilarious falsetto bridge about J. Lo’s ass. It's the same kind of breezy thrill afforded by “Frontin’”, Williams’ hit with Jay-Z from the 2003 compilation The Neptunes Present...Clones. However, that brings us to “Young Girl”, a mediocre paean to (maybe) underage ladies that sounds like a cross between very bad Prince-aping and “Sunshine”-era Jigga. It’s the first song in a truly ghastly second half of an album that didn't need to exist in the first place.And it's all downhill from there. The less said about “Number 1”-- perhaps Kanye West and Pharrell’s lowest four minutes ever-- the better. Even Pusha T of the Clipse strikes out on the limp “Stay With Me (Dim the Lights)”, a song that has me wondering what happened to the guy that laced Noreaga’s brain-bursting “Superthug”. Or Mystikal’s assiduous “Shake Ya Ass”. Or Britney’s irrefutable “I'm a Slave 4 U”.Williams’ hard sell on the album, more than a year ago, was a split work: Eight R&B songs and eight rap songs, speaking to his production history. It was also an opportunity for Skateboard P to spotlight not just his mosquito-throated singing style, but also his bric-a-brac cadence and elocution. Unfortunately, that's exactly what we get."

After releasing their debut in 2008, the Athens group did a stint opening for Dinosaur Jr. and the Meat Puppets, an apprenticeship that, for better or for worse, is evident on their sophomore album, Sugar. The guitars sound both sharper and muddier, the rhythm section condensed into a thunderous union, the vocals of Hardy Morris and Brantley Senn more prominent. In general, they sound more purposeful than ever, thanks to producer John Agnello, who has worked with Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth, and the Hold Steady.With Agnello at the helm, Dead Confederate come across as more capable, more professional-- in other words, not very exciting. Their music sounds calculated, at times lifeless. Senn is more of a presence here, trading vocal and songwriting duties with Morris, and the push and pull between them creates intriguing transitions and expands their range. Opener ""In the Dark"" recalls fellow Athenians the Whigs in its relatively upbeat cadence, and its swirling organ leads seamlessly into ""Run From the Gun"", which contains the album's strongest hook and Morris' best vocal performance. His strangely textured, androgynous voice is one of the band's most distinctive sounds, especially now that he's not straining for maximum angst. He shows some restraint on ""Father Figure"", an otherwise aimless track that channels Gish-era Smashing Pumpkins, and attempts some high-flying acrobatics on ""By Design"", soaring into his falsetto on the chorus.Sugar is notable as much for what's missing as for what's been honed and emphasized. Morris no longer howls like Kurt Cobain, nor does he drawl so studiously. There are no 12- or seven-minute stoner epics either; instead, the songs are shorter, more compact, punchier. Almost missing: personality. Part of the appeal of the band's self-released EP and, to a lesser extent, its debut was their ragged energy, the naïve excitement of young southerners messing around with non-native music, even if they were reaching beyond their grasp. Where once they got by on enthusiasm and sheer force of will, Sugar just sounds professional and deliberate. The songs no longer sound like Georgia, nor anywhere at all, and robbed of those roots and context, their music has no grounding, no subversive charm. Sugar is neither exciting nor egregious, neither good nor bad. It's just another rock record."

How could their whirlwind, vibraphone-driven post-rock get stuck in the background? Shouldn't it at least be distracting? As they finished their second full-length, Sugar, bassist Matthew Gengler wrote on their website: ""This year I'm pushing for more 'anthemic pelvic rockers' and fewer 'heartfelt ballads.'""And sure enough, after an attention-getting percussion intro, Sugar leaps into a song that pins your ears back like an extreme rollercoaster. ""They See Rocks"" vaults through its chord changes on Gengler's moon-walking bass and the one-man massacre of Cale Parks on drums. It has the lurching, exhilarating feel of Aloha's first albums, but this time the arrangement is bigger: Eric Koltnow's signature vibraphone mixes with electric piano and distorted guitar into molten rock candy.It's their loudest album, but the band still sound like music geeks: they favor pulsing rhythms to rock beats, and ""It Won't Be Long"" even echoes Steve Reich. On other tunes, they finally sound as jazzy as they've always threatened to be-- specifically, they're reminiscent of 70s fusion, with its driving rhythms and vague sense of conservatory educations. You can picture the dusty vinyl in their collections by bands like Weather Report and Eberhard Weber's Colours.They're not the first post-rock band to be serious instrumentalists, but they keep their chops in line by focusing on the songwriting. The mini-epic ""Let Your Head Hang Low"" and the exotic segues of ""Thieves All Around Us"" both fit inside five minutes, and the disturbingly titled ""Balling Phase"" may be their most ecstatic anthem yet. Tony Cavallario is also gaining confidence as a singer: his vocals are clearer and louder in the mix, but he's still earnest and direct, making sure he earns every high note and big chorus.Where their earlier songs were sometimes fragmentary, the material on Sugar is better developed, as each composition hold its own under independent scrutiny. As before, Aloha edits the songs together into continuous blocks of music, to replicate their live shows. However, this aspect also makes Sugar less fun than their last album, That's Your Fire, where the fast and slow songs hurtled into each other and shorter pieces of tunes ran into sprawling textural epics. To some listeners it sounded cobbled together, but to others, That's Your Fire was one of the more inspired post-rock albums of the past few years.Sugar needs more of that variety. Aloha throws everything they have-- their biggest arrangements and most belted-out lyrics-- at almost every song on the album. Near the end, ""Dissolving"" and ""I Wish No Chains Upon You"" each sound like just more anthemic bricks in the wall: either the band or the listener feels a little tapped. And Sugar could use more of the slow, spare tunes that Aloha was known for: in fact, the one thing this album truly lacks is one of the trademark, vaguely sappy ballads that the band is obviously trying to avoid. They might have been worried about getting typecast, but earlier songs like ""Roanoke Born"" and ""Saint Lorraine"" were-- and there's nothing wrong with it-- really fucking pretty. One or two of these per album won't make anyone think they're soft. Besides, I can't study over all this racket!"

Trying to move beyond that supporting role, he loads his sixth solo album with big-time producers, skits, and careful introspection.","Royce 5’9” (formerly Royce da 5’9”) has done a lot of his most visible rapping as a plus-one. His first appearance for many was on Eminem’s The Slim Shady LP as one half of Bad Meets Evil on a song of the same name. He caught his second wind years later as one of the senior members of the major label castoff Voltron that is Slaughterhouse (with Joe Budden, Crooked I, and Joell Ortiz). Most recently, he’s functioned as DJ Premier’s rapping partner in PRhyme. Royce is an excellent supporting character, but things never came together for any of his solo records, which tend to drag.His sixth studio album, Layers, isn’t much different, albeit not for lack of trying. Royce checks all the boxes on paper here, fully loading it with big-time producers, skits, and tons of careful introspection, the typical keys to a success for any traditionalist rap album. But this lyrical marathon falls short by any conceivable benchmark, unable to really get going or sustain momentum until the very end. There’s also plenty of rapping about how good at rapping he is, which is almost always boring.The main difference between Layers and past Royce records is supposed to be the newfound commitment to full-fledged storytelling, and it’s easy to hear those gears turning on songs like ""Startercoat"" and ""Misses."" On the former, he defends 2Pac's place in history, in response to the omission on Billboard's Greatest Rappers of All-Time list from last year (“If Pac ain’t on your list then you ain’t fucking logical”), using a UNLV Starter jacket as a symbol for the influence Pac had on him. On ""Misses,"" he writes about his relationship with his wife, implying it’s difficult being a married rapper. While these are functional stories with interesting plot points, they also prove he has a knack for overthinking (and oversharing), which torpedoes some of the strongest technical rapping on Layers. On “Tabernacle,” he tells the heartbreaking story of losing his grandmother and meeting his newborn son within hours at the same hospital. But he is incapable of building suspense or changing his tone, and what should be an epic tale is reduced to the songwriting equivalent of turn-by-turn navigation—taking readable steps toward a predetermined destination. He’s prone to rapping in bulk, and thus wants to narrate every detail of a story in a linear timetable, telegraphing outcomes; sometimes it’s like a nonfiction book on tape."

Over a frantic, Calvin Harris-produced, Guetta-meets-""Sandstorm"" beat on her sixth record's lead-off single, Rihanna repeats these words almost 20 times. ""We Found Love"" ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's not much more that needs to be said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to something suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret. Need I remind you of some of her most powerful hooks: Ella-ella-ella-ay. Oh-na-na. Ay-ayy-ay-ayy-ay-ayy.But as anyone with a Twitter handle will tell you, these are chatty times, and in 2011, the pop landscape's fittingly caught between two maximalist extremes: the winking theatricality of Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry, and the dribbling confessional-pop of Drake, Kanye West, and (yes, they're more alike than they'd like to believe) Taylor Swift. Barbados-born, millions-selling, armfuls-of-awards-winning Rihanna has found staggering success (23 years old; eleven #1 singles and rising) borrowing a little bit from each of these tendencies. Her recent music videos have dabbled in trendy pop artifice (check out her neon-hued, irresistibly smiley turn in Guetta’s ""Who’s That Chick?"" or the David LaChapelle-aping-- literally-- ""S&M""), while her brooding and personal 2009 album Rated R commented-- however obliquely-- on her public struggles. Rihanna seems more comfortable flitting between these two extremes than settling on either, but her past two albums have at least had some thematic cohesion. The same can't be said of Talk That Talk: Heavy on filler though it's only 11 tracks long, it feels not only slight but muddled, an assortment of half-baked ideas that never bloom. A stitched-together collection of club bangers, sleaze-pop missteps, and mid-tempo inspirational ballads, Talk That Talk feels at times like three different records, only one of which might have been any good.Of course, what we're supposed to be talking is about how this is Rihanna's ""dirtiest"" album yet. Early blog chatter reported to lots of critics blushing in preview listening sessions and making questionably bold declarations (""The dirtiest pop album since Madonna's Erotica!"") that suggested that they listen to very little pop radio, or that they have never been to an R. Kelly concert. Talk That Talk's raunchier moments should surprise no one: Rihanna's always been singing about sex-- she's just never shown such an unfortunate proclivity for cheesy lyrics and dessert metaphors. ""Suck my cockiness/ Lick my persuasion,"" Ri commands on the embarrassingly literal ""Cockiness (I Love It)"", hoping the boldness of the delivery will distract you from thinking about what a clunky line it is (it won't, though Bangladesh's beats might). The Esther Dean-penned ""Drunk on Love"" features a weak chorus lyric and vocal whose bombast feels out of place in the track's laid back, xx-sampling atmosphere. Clocking in at a puzzling-yet-merciful one minute and 18 seconds, The-Dream co-produced ""Birthday Cake"" is even more heavy-handed (lots of icing puns). There are flickers of empowerment here, but mostly it proves little more than the fact that a female artist can be responsible for Jeremih-grade cheese, too. A Rihanna album has never been without the occasional lyrical misfire (""Sex in the air/ I don't care/ I love the smell of it"" comes to mind), but at least on a track like ""S&M"" she sounds like she's having fun. For a record so preoccupied with passion and pleasure, most of Talk That Talk feels unsuitably robotic."

Daft Punk seem to be operating under the premise that if you hear something enough times, you'll start to believe it. But after more than 15 listens to Discovery's first single and opening track, ""One More Time,"" vocodered vocalist Romanthony doesn't have me ""feeling the need,"" much less not waiting, celebrating, and dancing so free. This could just be me, of course. Maybe I just haven't taken enough ecstasy and horse tranquilizers to appreciate the tinny, sampled brass ensemble, the too-sincere ""chill out"" midsection, or the fat drum machine beats that throb in time with my headache.Few things are more incriminating than Daft Punk's own lyrics, which, while generally deeper than ""don't stop the dancing,"" rarely go beyond sensitive junior high poetry and ""could this be love"" Whitesnake-isms. But music like this wasn't meant to be judged on its lyrics. And since Discovery relies heavily on the French neo-disco stylings established by 1997's Homework, the duo would probably suggest we shut up and dance.In truth, Discovery rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk, and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed ""One More Time."" Instead, Daft Punk focus on fusing mid-80's Kool and the Gang R&B; beats with post-millennial prog flourishes and more vocoders than you can shake at Herbie Hancock. Of the six tracks that feature vocals, four are smothered with the synthesized pitch corrector. On tracks like ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,"" the duo make it work by pushing the instrument to its breaking point, squeezing out subhuman glips and merging the vocals into a Vai-style synth-guitar solo. But when the band relies on the tool merely as a gimmick, as on ""Digital Love"" and ""Something about Us,"" the sentimental love songs come off with all the heart-melting earnestness of Kid Rock's ""Only God Knows Why.""Daft Punk typically succeed in an instrumental environment, though. Discovery's first big score comes with the rousing ""Crescendolls."" The obscure Imperials sample makes the song with spirited ""hey's"" and ""everybody y'all's"" yelled out from a crowd. ""Superheroes,"" which draws its repeated refrain from a late 70's Barry Manilow track called ""Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed,"" sates with a massive, fist-pumping kickdrum, complex chord changes, and light-speed keyboard bleeps. The snapping percussion and Phantasy Star II phaser synths of ""Verdis Quo"" recall a somber Flashdance-era Giorgio Moroder. And the 16-bit pitch-bent tones and Klymaxx electro-bass of ""Short Circuit"" would have felt at home on Trans Am's Surrender to the Night.Prog and disco have never openly begged for their own hybrid, but the genres' newborn Frankenbaby is alive, whether we like it or not. Still, this beast, however grotesque, is relatively harmless-- rather than running amok in the village and snapping the necks of civilians, it only wants to ""celebrate and dance so free, one more time."" Just don't let it sing."

Sometimes you just want a burger to taste exactly like the one you had last time, and Blue, the full-length debut by the Danish quartet Communions, announces its ingredients right away with opener “Come On, I’m Waiting.” Had the band added a signature Greg Hawkes-style keyboard line, it would have been even easier to imagine “Come On, I’m Waiting” as being by the Cars. Within a few measures, it’s clear that Communions aren’t trying to hide the well of styles they're drawing from.If you’re already familiar with the band's previous EPs, you know that Communions alternate between shoegaze and the meat-and-potatoes pop-rock that the Strokes sold to the world as punk/post-punk revivalism. On Blue, the smokestack plumes of guitar have mostly been cleared away in favor of a stripped-down production style that cuts closer to the bone. Second track “Today,” in fact, starts with a serrated, airtight guitar riff reminiscent of the Strokes’ 2001 debut Is This It. The similarity is so apparent that Communions may as well have tattooed the album cover onto their foreheads.By this point, one has to wonder if there’s anything left to say, musically speaking, when bands choose to go down this well-traveled road. And when you consider that acts like the Strokes and Interpol lifted so blatantly from Television in the first place, Communions risk the quality erosion that you get when you make a copy of a copy. Nevertheless, Blue’s skill rescues it. After the Strokes-style riff introduces “Today,” the song switches to a looser ’80s-pop atmosphere reminiscent of the Smiths’ “Ask.”That looseness is crucial; even the album’s basic production retains an openness that’s inviting rather than confining. Other bands who mold themselves after these styles typically do so with a fervor that can be stifling, but Blue conveys the sense that the band simply enjoys this music. At times, Communions sound inspired, like they pushed themselves to write songs that at least show some character. At other times, the band can sound somewhat lazy, as if it didn’t push quite hard enough. Which side of that line the songs on this album fall depends on where you draw the line yourself. Either way, the music on Blue is always lovingly crafted, and the album’s lack of musical pretense makes for an enjoyable, if predictable listen. If Blue were a restaurant, it would be the kind of place you go to for consistency and tasteful decor when you’re not in the mood for something fancier or more adventurous."

Her audiovisual works bounty and kin each house a subtle narrative that's more concerned with the movement of figures through space than concrete dramas in the traditional sense. bounty followed Lee through a series of textural transformations as she clawed through the world around her apparently in search of someone tall, bearded, and naked who's stranded in the Scandinavian countryside. kin saw her pass through different environments by enormous sentient shag rugs. Neither album resolved itself cleanly, but both fostered rich tension in music and visuals alike. Her best songs feel like they'd come for your body parts the second you divert your attention from them; thick and mysterious, they resist the usual half-life of boredom that affects songs designed for short-term radio play. Like the Knife, iamamiwhoami threads ghosts through what you thought you knew about the pop song.Or she did. Compared to kin and bounty's viscerally unnerving shorts, BLUE's visuals play out like screensavers. Lee dances in beautiful scenery. Lee fits messages into bottles and casts them out to sea, attempting to communicate with figures in black morphsuits who don't carry nearly the visual weight of her bizarrely disfigured companions from the first two records. The images are lovely but tedious, and the music follows suit.BLUE's audio component flows on synths that gleam like the ice Lee fondles in its videos, glassy and pale. ""Hunting for Pearls"" ripples with arpeggios that make it sound more uptempo than it actually is, while the bristling bass on ""Tap Your Glass"" sounds like it could have been scraped off Shaking the Habitual's cutting room floor. At points the album echoes Madonna's Ray of Light, but Lee doesn't quite have the gravitas to pull off these round, easy melodies. She's a songwriter that thrives on danger; BLUE encloses her in a space where she's far too safe.""Thin"" is the closest iamamiwhoami gets to its old mischief, setting Lee's voice close in the ear over faraway percussion. It's riddled with the same neon arpeggios that take up space everywhere else on the record, but it at least leaves some shadows for Lee to get lost in. It shifts its course halfway through, moving seamlessly from slow stalker to towering ballad. But it's a rare moment of intrigue on an album that's generous in its beauty while leaving little to wonder about, a sky that never rains."

Other big time producers from, Afrojack to Zedd, make mostly humorless music. Their drops and major keys work for clubs of course, with huge dynamic shifts that play to the pit of your stomach the same way a roller coaster does. The genius of them is they also work for partying on a smaller scale, like for at-home pregaming. EDM’s lack of subtlety isn’t a fault—it’s the entire point. For the genre, you can often replace questions of “good” and bad” with “useful” or “useless.” EDM is a tool as much as it is a type of music. DJ Snake has taken EDM’s inherent grandeur and played around in its sandbox. “Turn Down for What,” especially, turned the dial past eleven. Its over the top aggression is written into its rhythms. The song has Lil Jon barking at you. It’s ludicrous, and excellently so. After billions of of plays, it’s still not old, as it well overshoots its modest ambitions. In other words, at his best, DJ Snake under-promises and over-delivers.Unfortunately, we don’t get much of DJ Snake at his best on Encore. Clearly DJ Snake has the ability to make some serious earworms: “Sahara,” with Skrillex, adds an element of surprise, in the form of tablas and chanting. It’s got a predictable buildup and inevitable drop, before some very “Turn Down” esque synth jabs take over. It’s dumb fun. “Ocho Cinco,” the album’s most successfully ridiculous track, mostly eschews vocals (like “Sahara”) and utilizes what basically sounds like a nail gun for most of its drums. It sounds appropriate for driving your car into a wall. Same with “Propaganda,” which follows a similar formula of exuberant pummelling.But instead of just riding out that vim and vigor, he looks to make a real album, more songs with choruses and verses. Why? There’s a fish with a bicycle comparison to be made here. The album is simply not the format for DJ Snake. The conventional song barely is. He makes tracks. Instead of being, at least, a collection of great, standalone singles, the album is riddled with ill-advised rap songs and bad ballads. At best, “Let Me Love You,” the collaboration with Justin Bieber (who knows his way around silly EDM beats) is forgettable. Jeremih, on “The Half” sounds half awake on the beat’s video game bloops. Closer “Here Comes the Night” with Mr. Hudson is actually pretty good in that slick Ryan-Gosling-movie-credits way. But how a clunker like “Future Pt 2” with limp vocals from Bipolar Sunshine ended up next to these songs is anyone’s guess. Can no one working on these records tell how bad they are?Ultimately, the question that remains with Encore is really just: Why does this exist? The party tracks on here are exceptional at doing what they do. The guy can make a banger. Surely those songs would have the life they deserve on computer screens and in subwoofers however they’re released. The “Turn Down for What” video has half a billion YouTube views! It’s digestible. In what way does an uneven album help DJ Snake or his fans? Is his ambition to be a producer and songwriter? It probably shouldn’t be. No one needs these wet noodle ballads. They’re inoffensive, sure, but they’re completely unnecessary. Not sure what made him turn down."

America loves a tale of redemption almost as much as one of comeuppance, but at the start of the decade you'd have gotten pretty long odds on the media and cultural elite spinning the Marshall Mathers yarn as the former before the latter. And yet, somewhere between hugging Elton onstage at the Grammys and sending that guy in the Pistons jersey to pick up his Oscar, Em was feted by many of America's best-known cultural crits, columnist, and pundits: Frank Rich, Andrew Sarris, Maureen Dowd, Greil Marcus, Neal Gabler, and Paul Slansky (among others) either laid garlands at his feet or rhapsodized about the supposed transformation of the rapper/actor.The epistolary weepie ""Stan"" and the survivalist self-helpisms of ""Lose Yourself"" played a part in the slow mainstream media embrace of Eminem, but it's that ""slash"" that seemed to complete the embrace. For whatever reason, a film career can do that-- maybe it's the ability for a lengthy narrative to be more explicitly mutli-dimensional or maybe it's just lazy thinking and knee-jerk reactionary assumptions about pop, but you're now as likely to see Em torn down on Vibe than The New York Times Magazine.Well, Maureen, Andrew, and Greil, get ready to be excited; most of the rest of you-- the ones who've been held enthrall by Em's complex games of shifting his identity, challenging hypocrisy, baiting liberal guilt, and spitting deft rhymes with his labyrinthine flow-- prepare for disappointment: Encore is a fourth fascinating record from Eminem, but it's also easily his weakest and, in many ways, tamest album to date.Eminem's reaction to respectability seems to have been to move in two different directions: introspection and reconciliation on the one side, and bodily fluid-obsessed humor on the other. Tracks in which Em offers confessions, explanations, and apologies for previous comments and his participation in high-profile beefs share time here with belching, farting, vomiting, and urinating. He's also scrubbed his lyrics of homophobia (instead, the fascinating and eyebrow-raising homoeroticism hinted at on The Eminem Show-- and literally fleshed out in his music video cross-dressing-- colors a handful of his songs here) and, save a few blasts at Kim, any elements of misogyny.Therefore, if Encore is anything, it's a transitional record. After an image-confounding trio of pseudo self-titled records, the Eminem of Encore is wounded and weary; he's removing the layers of meta, still laughing and nodding but rarely winking, and not disappearing behind what The Village Voice's Frank Kogan once labeled Em's lyrical ""trapdoors and escape hatches."" Instead, the LP is the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games, and often seems to be rapping only to entertain himself with little regard for any potential audience. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Despite the album's pronounced maturity/infantilism divide, it's a different dichotomy that characterizes the album's highlights: Here, Em is at his best when he's either more focused than even before or at his most scattered and playful. Unfortunately, most of the tracks that don't veer toward either extreme are plodding and unremarkable."

Today we revisit the Arizona band’s third album, a giant canvas of rock and pop songwriting that wears its heart on its sleeve.","When Jimmy Eat World started recording their third full-length LP, Clarity, they suspected it would be their last. Formed in Mesa, Arizona during the era when major labels were absorbing alternative rock bands as if through osmosis, they signed to Capitol in the mid-’90s, and the first album they recorded for the label, 1996’s Static Prevails, performed below expectations. They knew if they didn’t sell significantly more on the second attempt, the label would drop them.They also assumed this would be the last chance they’d have the budget to make a really big album—not “big” in the sense of volume and speed, but more in the way even a small painting can seem big, the enormity of the subject suggested by how finely-wrought its details are. They would record every idea they had in search of this effect. Organs, synthesizers, vibraphones, and any kind of percussion instrument they could find—including timpani—blanketed the floor of the studio like unruly houseplants.The band’s sound was also in a state of mutation. When they were teenagers, they debuted as a skate punk band, but after hearing the glacial prettiness of Denver emo band Christie Front Drive, the spaces between the chords and even the individual notes in Jimmy Eat World songs started to grow. By the time they recorded Static Prevails, their songs were unknown landscapes, the ground giving way to sudden pitfalls. Their inner dynamic was starting to change too; during the writing of Clarity, their original lead singer, guitarist Tom Linton, whose scorched Jawbox-y growl featured on at least half of Static Prevails, withdrew from the microphone almost entirely, ceding lead vocal duties to Jim Adkins on all of Clarity except for one song. It wasn’t a conscious choice; Adkins just tended to have the first idea for lyrics as the songs were forming in the band’s practice space. But Adkins’ vocal register also hovers at a considerable distance above Linton’s; it is birdsong high, conveying more emotion and energy and way less exhaustion. Listening to him sing was like being tuned into someone’s innermost thoughts and hearing them echo off their chest cavity—nothing gets in the way between you and the ache in his voice.By this point, Jimmy Eat World had been categorized as an emo band. Not that they welcomed it. Like a Groucho Marx routine on loop, emo was a club no self-respecting punk would belong to. Guy Picciotto, member of flagship emo bands Rites of Spring and Fugazi, said he never recognized “emo” as a legitimate genre of music. “I just thought that all the bands I played in were punk rock bands,” he said. “What, like the Bad Brains weren’t emotional? What—they were robots or something?” Other bands acted as if they’d been accused of something unseemly when it came up in interviews, putting as much distance between the genre and their music as they could. Whatever reverence or weight it may have acquired in the past decade, “emo” still sounds pejorative on a phonetic level—the kind of word that triggers an eye roll as you say it, like a muscle spasm. There’s something inherently immature and unformed in the designation, evoking the miseries of the hopelessly teenaged, voluntary adolescents adrift in torments they should’ve outgrown by now."

Unlike her collaborators Charli XCX and SOPHIE, she doesn’t want to push pop into the future or dismantle it and play with the parts; instead, she takes the genre as it’s being expressed this very moment and renders it brighter, bolder, and more aggressive. If heavy hitters like Ariana Grande and Halsey are making fruit juice, she’s a tier below, churning out frozen concentrate: similar taste, but in an undiluted, hyper-dense package.Despite her extremely online aesthetic and streaming-era approach to releasing new music, she’s ultimately a traditionalist. I listen to her music and hear someone who fell in love with the idea of pop from a distance—she grew up in Cologne, Germany, half a world away from the American music industry—long before she had the chance to make it herself. She’s a scholar of the hit, and she’s honoring her passion by iterating on the form.Clarity, her debut full-length project, feels less like a major statement than the culmination of a lengthy, controlled burn. After breaking out in 2017 with “I Don’t Want It at All,” a strobe-lit sugar-baby anthem that made “Material Girl” seem demure, Petras slowly assembled a portfolio of strong singles that demonstrated her impressive stylistic range. She glided from gleaming, Robyn-esque anthems (“Heart to Break”) and wistful trap-pop ballads (“Homework”) to faithful bloghouse revivals like “Close Your Eyes,” a highlight from last year’s goofy Halloween-themed EP Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1.It’d make for a heartwarming underdog story—an aspiring star moves to Los Angeles to make it in the music business, writing songs and crashing on couches until the dream comes true—if her chief creative partner wasn’t Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald, the superproducer-turned-pariah whose career entered a precipitous decline after Kesha accused him of sexual assault and physical abuse. When Petras has been asked about or criticized for working with Gottwald, her responses are equivocal but unapologetic: “While I’ve been open and honest about my positive experience with Dr. Luke, that does not negate or dismiss the experiences of others or suggest that multiple perspectives cannot exist at once,” she tweeted last July. “I do want to express my sympathy for any and all abuse victims.”Yet there exists a stark contrast between the complexity surrounding Petras’ career and the flagrant, almost pointed frivolity of her music. Clarity is a collection of decadent, deeply silly songs, all of them delivered by the kind of person who uses even the slightest bit of emotional turmoil as an excuse to immerse herself in sex, drugs, and money. (Consider this representative couplet from the bratty “Blow It All”: “Shorty in the bathroom and she’s asking ‘where the coke at?’/I spent 20 thousand just to leave it on a coat rack.”) Feeling sad, feeling horny, feeling sad and horny, living like you’re dying—these may not be novel themes, but they’re delivered with palpable enthusiasm and good humor. Petras loves pop enough to celebrate its tropes. When she takes a second in the middle of the raunchy “Do Me” to sing about hitting “high notes” in bed, you’d better believe she’s going to cut the backing track and jump up an octave just for that phrase. It’s hard not to giggle."

It imparts lovelorn angst and sweet romanticism in equal measure.","In 2013, Niia Bertino emerged as a mysterious figure in R&B. A classically trained pianist and jazz singer, her first single, “Made for You,” thrived as a haunting soul ballad that, when paired with producer Robin Hannibal’s scant backing track, allowed Niia’s voice to shine. A year later, on “Generation Blue,” she and Hannibal delved into 1980s dream pop, the kind of serene synth-driven melody you’d hear in a John Hughes film. Then, on “Body,” Hannibal’s production took a lighter turn; with its faint guitar riff and barely-there percussion, it closely resembled Hannibal’s work with Rhye, his nostalgic R&B duo with Toronto singer Mike Milosh. Much like Milosh, whose feathery falsetto draws comparisons to Sade, there’s a rich subtlety to Niia’s inflection that fits well with Hannibal’s nuanced soundscapes, no matter what mood they emit.So while Niia’s debut album, I, is technically a solo endeavor, it feels like a collaborative effort with Hannibal that compiles trip-hop and sophisti-pop into one set. It feels brighter and more streamlined, fusing elements of Niia’s heavier jazz-influenced sound with modern bounce. Keeping with Niia and Hannibal’s previous output, I is a placid affair, in which Niia explores the thrill of new love and the complications that arise along the way. “Last Night in Los Feliz” might be its best song: Amid the composer’s delicate orchestral soul, Niia recalls the softer side of devotion, when she and her partner would embrace each other under the stars. Yet there’s a hint of sadness beneath it all, like Niia is holding on to moments that are slowly beginning to fade.Compared with songs like “Made for You” and “Libertine Hero,” these tracks are easier to digest, making I a fluid listen that imparts lovelorn angst and sweet romanticism in equal measure. On “Sideline” and “Day & Night,” Niia plays the role of a jilted lover pleading for one more chance. On “Nobody” and “Girl Like Me,” she becomes the innocent pursuer, speaking sweet nothings that land softly on the ear. “I don’t even care what time it is,” she sings on “Nobody,” “... I want to play Mr. and Mrs.” Lyrics like these cut both ways on *I: *Hannibal’s sparse soundtrack draws immediate attention to Niia’s songwriting, which fastens nicely to the beats, leading to a sustained groove. Though as it plays, the words seems secondary to the music and don’t really hold up in the long run.Niia’s voice is impressive here, but without stronger narratives to reinforce it, the instrumentals emerge as the record’s most enthralling element. To that end, I sets a refreshing vibe that brings to mind groups like Quadron and Zero 7, evoking a grown-up ethos tailor-made for yacht parties or chill Sundays at home. Yet without distinct standouts, *I *fades into the backdrop, resulting in a decent album that’s a bit too comfortable. Given the resonant power of Niia’s tone and the dynamic essence of Hannibal’s arrangements, they could stand to take a few more risks."

Though they share a sound with some of the other Japanese artists to penetrate the U.S. indie rock scene, they lacked Cornelius' vision, never came close to the touch and refinement of Takako Minekawa, and as for Shonen Knife, well... okay, they do just about everything better than Shonen Knife. But still, though they've consistently come up with a great track or two per release, Buffalo Daughter has never distinguished themselves in any way. They're as eclectic as their peers, but something has been missing on previous releases for Grand Royal.After hearing this, their first record for Emperor Norton, I've finally figured out what it is: the songs. Buffalo Daughter produce exceptional-sounding tracks that cover a wide spectrum of genres, texture and mood; they perform well on a variety of instruments, and their voices blend nicely most of the time. But they don't write great songs-- too often, they don't even write good ones. Though they're genre-hopping like mad, and making all the sounds pretty, if you have people singing and you're adhering to pop structure, you best be writing some songs. So as usual, I has few standouts.The first of these is the fantastically catchy riff-rocker ""28 Nuts."" After an extended intro that sounds like the band tuning up in front of an orchestra, the crunch takes over, and Buffalo Daughter sound like the Primitives with the vocals pitched down an octave. Forget that the crude two-chord riff is the mirror image of the hook that drove ""Great Five Lakes""-- this is still a great track. Also fine is the title track, which does away with the electricity and opts for dreamy Brazilian pop, complete with some heartwarming flute. A half-notch below these is the midtempo, harmony-laden ""Mirror Ball,"" which has the prettiest melody on the album but eventually wears out its welcome as it passes the seven-minute mark. ""Discotheque du Paradis"" is an engaging slice of roller-rink pop with an unexpected Kraftwerk sample.The rest of I displays admirable diversity, but no great songs. The lumbering ""Earth Punk Rockers"" has a proggy cast to it and wants to sound like the Flaming Lips' ""The Gash,"" but ultimately the poor singing and non-existent melody sink it. ""Robot Sings (As If He Were Frank Sinatra with a Half-Boiled Egg and the Salt Shaker on a Breakfast Table)"" has a nice-enough title and, yes, vocodered vocals, but the limp structure just kind of lays there. All told, I is far from a terrible record, but Buffalo Daughter only skim the surface of greatness, flirting with a myriad of styles without ever perfecting any of them."

Today, we revisit Daft Punk’s debut, the duo’s greatest illusion yet.","Daft Punk’s Homework is, in its pure existence, a study in contradictions. The debut album from Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo arrived in 1997, right around the proliferation of big-beat and electronica—a twin-headed hydra of dance music fads embraced by the music industry following the commercialization of early ’90s rave culture—but when it came to presumptive contemporaries from those pseudo-movements, Homework shared Sam Goody rack space and not much else. Daft Punk’s introduction to the greater world also came at a time when French electronic music was gaining international recognition, from sturdy discotheque designs to jazzy, downtempo excursions—music that sounded miles away from Homework’s rude, brutalist house music.In the 21 years since Homework’s release, Daft Punk have strayed far from its sound with globe-traversing electronic pop that, even while incorporating other elements of dance music subgenres, has more often than not kept house music’s building blocks at arms’ length. 2001’s Discovery was effectively electronic pop-as-Crayola box, with loads of chunky color and front-and-center vocals that carried massive mainstream appeal. Human After All from 2005 favored dirty guitars and repetitive, Teutonic sloganeering, while the pair took a nostalgia trip through the history of electronic pop itself for 2013’s Random Access Memories. Were it not for a few choice Homework tracks that pop up on 2007’s exhilarating live document Alive 2007, one might assume that Homework has been lost in the narrative that’s formed since its release—that of Daft Punk as robot-helmeted superstar avatars, rather than as irreverent house savants.But even as the straightforward and strident club fare on Homework remains singular within Daft Punk’s catalog, the record also set the stage for the duo’s career to this very day—a massively successful and still-going ascent to pop iconography, built on the magic trick-esque ability to twist the shapes of dance music’s past to resemble something seemingly futuristic. Whether you’re talking about Bangalter and Homem-Christo’s predilection for global-kitsch nostalgia, their canny and self-possessed sense of business savvy, or their willingness to wear their influences on their sleeve like ironed-on jean-jacket patches—it all began with Homework.It couldn’t possibly make more sense that a pair of musicians whose most recent album sounds like a theme park ride through pop and electronic music’s past got their big break at Disneyland. It was 1993, and schoolboy friends Bangalter and Homem-Christo’s rock band with future Phoenix guitarist Laurent Brancowitz, Darlin’—named after a track from the 1967 Beach Boys album Wild Honey that the three shared an affinity for—had disbanded after a year of existence that included a few songs released on Stereolab’s Duophonic label. (Melody Maker writer Dave Jennings notoriously referred to their songs as possessing “a daft punky thrash,” which led to the pair assuming the Daft Punk moniker.)"

The group recorded the album before Donald Trump’s victory—as Dave Chappelle, who hosted SNL that night, repeatedly argued, Trump was merely sticking his finger in existing fault lines—but the results gave it new gravity. It was a moment of philosophical as well as aesthetic triumph for Tribe, their prescience made obvious.Not all its members made it there to gloat. During the second verse of the galvanizing “We the People…,” when Phife Dawg’s vocals kicked in, Q-Tip and Jarobi shuffled to the stage wings, making room for a giant banner with Phife’s face to be unfurled. NBC’s cameras zoomed in on the late rapper’s picture until the living ones reappeared in the frame to play hypeman for their friend, their backs turned to the studio audience, egging on a static image.The performance was less than eight months after Phife, born Malik Taylor, had died from diabetes-related complications at the age of 45. In the nearly 20 years between The Love Movement and We got it from Here, Phife, dogged by ill health and still frustrated over the dynamics that led to Tribe’s breakup, released little music. Forever, his first posthumous album—assembled by his longtime DJ, Dion Liverpool, from largely unfinished demos—reveals what had become most important to Phife in his post-Tribe years: family and a particular kind of integrity, where teaching a child to read and not fucking up a cypher are interconnected parts of one worldview. It also shows a dexterous vocal style that is more easily transposed across eras than longtime listeners might have imagined.Phife and Q-Tip met when they were children attending the same Seventh Day Adventist church in Queens. But where Q-Tip was free to pursue his secular interests—his father was a jazz collector, and the opening verse to The Low End Theory recounts an informed back-and-forth about musical styles between father and son—Phife’s family adhered more strictly to the faith. He wasn’t permitted to hear hip-hop, much less participate in it, except in surreptitious doses outside the home. This is perhaps why, if Q-Tip could turn moodily inward or grapple with abstract social issues, Phife’s raps always felt more purely social. He was trying to intimidate or entertain, always playing to the block parties in his memory."

When local officials shuttered the space in the wake of the 2016 Oakland Ghost Ship fire, Johnston and her close friend Colin Ward were two of 15 local musicians displaced. A little over a year later, Ward died unexpectedly. The back-to-back losses left Johnston feeling suffocated by sorrow, disconnected from her community in a city that no longer felt like home. She immersed herself in the songwriting process until she resurfaced with Forever, a collection of candid, minimalist shoegaze that grapples with the impermanence of life.With the barren dream-pop of album opener “2018,” she surveys the year and forces herself to accept the truth, repeating, “This is really happening” until the words go numb. There’s always been an air of detachment to Midwife’s music—2017’s Like Author, Like Daughter sounds like anesthetized Grouper—but here she sounds trapped, stuck in the purgatory of grief. On lead single “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” which sounds nothing like the Radiohead song, a hazy wash of guitar floods the air as she lies flat on her back, fixated on the desire to outrun her life yet pinned beneath the minute hand of a clock. It’s the type of warm, melancholic drone you want to pull up to your chin like a weighted blanket, and she wisely follows it with “Vow,” a heartbreaking instrumental that spaces out its lone piano chords so each one falls like a teardrop.Midwife is the rare artist who can wallow in pain without indulging self-pity. She performs her own kind of therapeutic practice on “C.R.F.W.,” a nearly nine-minute sprawl that opens with a recording of Ward reading an original poem about desire and fate, originally commissioned for the 2011 collaborative project Pure Becoming. His recitation is empathetic, spiritual, spoken in a flat tone with no audience in mind. In the final line, he compares death to a falling leaf: “Imagine the way a breeze feels against your leaf body when you finally don’t have to hold on anymore.” It’s not the poem itself that’s so remarkable, but the way Midwife follows his words with ambient drone and tectonic synth hums, turning it into a moving homage that feels like a hypnagogic meditation on the possibility of an afterlife.Johnston calls her music “heaven metal,” and Forever is heavy and hypnotic, full of nearly wordless ruminations on the pain of loss. But while the album begins as an outlet for grief, it grows towards zen-like acceptance of death. Closer “S.W.I.M.” capitalizes on Midwife’s strengths—blown-out fuzz, lethargic percussion, a pop of melody that appears like a daydream—to mirror her lyrics: “Treading water my whole life/I don’t want to swim forever/Reaching for the other side.” Forever is first and foremost a tribute to Ward, but its strength lies in the power of Johnston’s singular experience to unlock communal knowledge: that the mourning process never really becomes less painful, but so long as it’s inevitable, we need not feel alone."

Man’s first video accused the 29-year-old Jamaican deejay of putting on false airs about his humble roots, and the follow-up diss track warned him against surpassing his place. In the past, Popcaan might have entertained a response, like the “Stray Dog” clapback when Alkaline took jabs at his masculinity. Now, though, he prefers leaving those badmind rivals on read. For Popcaan (born Andrae Jay Sutherland), asserting dominance over the Kingston microcosm is an unspoken flex: He lets the private jet, the gold chains around his neck, and a Midas-touch cosign from Drake do the talking. Landing a full four years after his summer 2014 debut Where We Come From, Popcaan’s second album peacocks the wealth of his international pop celebrity. Forever is an overflowing chalice, and he’s is overly eager to offer us a sip.In late June, the head of Unruly records described manifesting his destiny (in the form of high-profile collaborations with Jamie xx, Pusha-T, Gorillaz, among others) to radio host Zane Lowe, saying: “I keep my thoughts clean and positive.” Fittingly, Popcaan continues to boast his untouchable purity on Forever. The first song “Silence” contemplates the paranoia of fame, but gives reassurance: “And my heart clean, filled with love/And mi meditation sharp like studs.” His chief conspirator and Mixpak Records’ Brooklyn beatmaker Dre Skull makes an equally dignified return, imbuing the song with sonic gravitas through quickening thrums of bass and misty atmospherics. Spirituality is the current that electrifies Forever. On “Firm & Strong,” the glory of a 20-person choir shake stained glass windows with Popcaan’s soulful affirmations. The bookend “A Wha Suh” is a sincere pep-talk from a psalm-slinging confidant—only to be rendered banal by mid-range piano chords from step-in producer Not Nice.Each blessing Popcaan counts strengthens his carefree swagger. Rather than the accidental intersection of pop and dancehall that sprung from Where We Come From, his sinewy melodies and Dre Skull’s grooves here are more deliberate angles towards mainstream audiences. He claims this bid for the spotlight with the same rigor his soaring croons hurtle over the sparkly synth lines on “Superstar.” Framed within a rags-to-riches context, the singalong chorus, “Man a star, man a star/Man a super,” knows everyone cheers when the underdog punches the air amidst a thrilling recovery. Equally infectious is “Happy Now,” where Popcaan’s wavering ad libs undergo a slight AutoTune treatment, a correction very evocative of pop tradition.Forever falters when Popcaan confronts romantic limitations. At least the lusty rhapsodies on “Naked” and the cries of “Wine fi the money now” on “Dun Rich” own their irreverence. He barely musters a convincing lilt to carry the words “Girl you love me for free, yeah/This must be love” on the vapid “Through the Storm.” What’s worse is the cloying guitars in the background with a twang borrowed from sine feeble boy band 10 years his junior. Wrestling ballads away from weak sentimentalism requires a higher degree of finesse than assembling hip-swaying hits.Entering the big pop arena often comes with the question of superficiality, of watering down truth, or tuning up reality for the onlooker. The charisma underneath Popcaan’s veneer of wealth saves his work from feeling entirely contrived. However, like panning for precious metals, Forever requires sieving through plates of glinting sediment before discovering treasure. The album is best when luxuriating in its own divine intensity, when an earnest Popcaan reconciles the hunger of his past with the feasting of his present, hands clasped in grace."

The Pittsburgh savants—musical partners since high school, barely legal at the time of their 2012 signing, long barred from the club circuit due to their age—have certainly paid their dues. They’ve spent the past decade plotting and pummeling their way from the hardcore underground to rock’s MainStage, touring with everyone from Full of Hell and Touché Amoré to Deftones and the Misfits and recording under the guidance of two of the most respected luminaries in their genre. Their first two albums (2012’s Love Is Love // Return to Dust and 2014’s I Am King) were released on Converge frontman Jacob Bannon’s Deathwish Inc. label, and produced by his bandmate Kurt Ballou, one of metal’s most highly-regarded board wizards. And yet, even as they stay the course, the group continue to grapple with their precocious past, leading some to reframe them as interlopers, snooty art school kids trying to act tough.Certainly, Code Orange’s aesthetic and presence involve plenty of mean mugging: grisly music videos and artwork, on-the-record refusals to tour with acts they consider “bargain-bin deathcore bands,” unflinching accounts of in-studio fist fights, vows of Darwinist vengeance against the “fake rockstar mentality” espoused by scene hotshots like Asking Alexandra (“They will be the first to go,” the self-proclaimed “thinners of the herd” stated ominously in a Facebook post). With their third LP and major-label debut Forever, Code Orange have offered up compelling, caustic–occasionally, even catchy–evidence that their claims of intra-scene superiority are, for the most part, justified.Despite all this talk, the Code Orange crew's approach is surprisingly communal. There’s no bandleader to speak of; instead, we’ve got a vocal tag-team between drummer Jami Morgan and guitarists Reba Meyers and Eric Balderose, the latter of whom’s on power electronics duty as well. They’re less a trio than a cacophonous hydra fighting with itself, each head bearing a distinctive battle cry: Morgan’s razor-throated yelps and deadpanned raps; Meyers’ piercing shrieks, alternated with the haunting alto typically reserved for her pop-punk side project, Adventures; and Balderose’s guttural death growls. This multivalence is partially to blame for the album’s erratic atmosphere; rather than reconcile these disparate approaches, the band duke things out in turn, leaving the guitar hooks (and Joe Goldman’s unfussed, even-keel bass playing) to tie everything together. Sometimes, a twisted choir forms: the half-sung, half-shouted chorus of “The Mud” for instance, or the end of “Hurt Goes On.”"

However, its 39 minutes often run together.","A lot more goes into release dates than ""seasonal appropriateness,"" I realize, but Painted Palms' Forever sure doesn't feel like a January record. The long-gestating debut LP from the San Francisco psych-pop duo is a bright, spangling, decidedly summery affair, all radiant harmonies and warm reverberations. Forever's pleasures are simple, breezy, a little like bringing a parka to the pool: you're supposed to dive right in, not waste a lot of time peeling back the layers. Forever is lush, easygoing, 39 balmy minutes in paradise. But spend too much time in these all-too-pleasant surroundings, and you can't help but feel like you've been there before.Cousins Reese Donohue and Christopher Prudhomme planted the seeds of Painted Palms when the pair were separated by a dozen states, gradually building up tracks from the snippets they'd shoot back-and-forth through email. And, though they've both called San Francisco home for a number of years, Forever's shimmering construction is mostly in line with their earlier efforts. Like a lot of young bands, they're certainly not shy about their fondness for the Beach Boys and their legions of sonic followers; especially Animal Collective, and even more especially, Panda Bear's 2007 landmark Person Pitch. The Palms do have a few legs up on much of the not-exactly-thin post-Pitch crowd; their sound's fuller, the sense of melody better defined. And, in Prudhomme, they've got a singer who serves as their answer to Noah Lennox. On ""Too High,"" for instance, Prudhomme cuts through the track's radar-gun reverb with a swooping, choirboy-in-an-echo-chamber vocal line packed with the long vowel sounds Lennox favors. The similarities don't stop in Prudhomme's throat; between Forever's droning intros, distressed breakbeats, and prickly calliope-style keyboards, it's fairly clear just who these guys owe much of their sound to.Lyrically, Forever concerns itself with a lot of minor communication breakdowns: ""never ever said the things that mattered,"" ""she didn't understand that I was having trouble in my head."" And, in keeping with the music's endlessly summery vibe, the rest is pleasantly half-baked: ""look at my hands and look at the air,"" ""when I see the light,"" ""I can't tell if I'm high or low."" What there's not, unfortunately, is any sense of urgency, anything lending these songs much in the way of consequence or fervor. That ""never said the things that mattered"" line (from ""Soft Hammer"", Forever's most unadulterated Beach Boys nod) seems especially telling. These songs may be well-crafted, busy without being overcluttered, built around strong—if not particularly distinctive—melodies. But, since Prudhomme and Donohue haven't quite yet figured out how to assert themselves above their fairly obvious influences, where personality's concerned, they're a little lacking.Between the carefully plotted reference points and the not-exactly-gripping lyrics, Forever tends to run together over the course of its 39-minute runtime. Still, taken song-for-song, there's no shortage of takeaways: the bouncy ""Not Really There"", the ambling Atlas Sound-alike ""Carousel"", the late-LP one-two of the brash ""Spinning Signs"" and the tender ""Sleepwalking."" Donohue and Prudhomme certainly know their way around a melody, and their careful craftsmanship puts them a notch or two ahead of the oft-slapdash box-ticking of a lot of easily led up-and-comers. But, if they hope to keep it going through the next cold snap, Painted Palms still need to figure out a way to bring a little more of themselves to the party."

Going for broke, their sophomore LP Forever transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright and emotionally charged.","In Stockholm, there is no scene. At least, there’s no scene like they have in Copenhagen, a community centered around the boutique Posh Isolation label started in 2009 by Christian Stadsgaard and Loke Rahbek. This is the label that launched a thousand Danish hardcore post-punk bands and their synth-noise side projects like Sexdrome, Damien Dubrovnik, Marching Church, Lust For Youth, Vår, Lower, and Iceage-- all of whom share at least one or more members between them. Andreas Lagerström,the lead singer and bassist for Holograms, said in an interview earlier this year, “we have nothing like that in Stockholm. We really like Iceage [and] Lower but most of us didn’t know about them when we started.” Though, he did admit to talking with Iceage on MySpace “like, five years ago when they were like thirteen or something.”So there’s Posh Isolation and then there’s real isolation like what the young Holograms have experienced after a grueling and bank-breaking 2012 world tour. Returning to their homes in the night-swept winter of Stockholm with no jobs, no money, and no real scene to speak of, their only lifelines were each other. Add in the only six or seven hours of sunlight that Stockholm was getting in the winter, the backdrop for the band’s sophomore album Forever starts to come into focus. Even for hyperborean punk, things were dark. Given the circumstances, and their precedent for synth-heavy dourness on their self-titled debut, it would be understandable for the band to turn in an exhausted and slapdash placeholder until conditions improved, or at least until two of the band members stretched their legs and formed a synth-noise side project. Instead, the factory-floor post-punk quartet doubled down on their sound and literally went for broke, taking their fear and desolation and sending it out to near arena heights.Lead single, the corporeal “Flesh And Bone” served as a bellwether as to where the band was heading, but it was just the tip. Its Peter Hook bass line and down-stroked eighth-note guitars lead the album much like they lead the song-- Now they have more in common with the sharpness of Joy Division or even the thickness of Editors, and creep further away from the electro-punk or hardcore-punk of their Danish doppelgangers. Most remarkable about Holograms is how they transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright. Flying in the face of insular self-pity, they avoid all the trappings of isolation and turn it into 10 songs whose every syllable warrants a fist pump."

Here, leader Stefanie Franciotti gives equal prominence to both highly-textured songs and errant noise.","Austin's Sleep ∞ Over first appeared as a trio with a woozy pop 7"" on Forest Family last year. Since then, they've slimmed down to one member, Stefanie Franciotti, who returns with an upgraded full-length debut that plays like a shoegaze record for a generation reared on The NeverEnding Story.Franciotti's sound hinges on her dual interest in highly textured pop and errant noise. On the project's early tracks, those elements resulted in a sound that was aimless and a little soupy, if still pretty. Here, Franciotti is able to create a dynamic contrast by giving equal prominence to each, alternating between new wave-indebted slow-dance jams and experimental tracks that range in tone from sublimely ambient to jagged and far-out. This puts Franciotti in the company of Peaking Lights and Sun Araw, and while she's not as cosmically bent as either, she's making the same kind of escapist music that, at its best, can feel transportative.Ultimately, the album's song-oriented material is the most memorable. ""Romantic Streams"", ""Casual Diamond"", and highlight ""Stickers"" are peppered with space-age chimes and melting glissandos that feel grounded and organic. And despite all the machine noise, Franciotti's vocals feel approachable and human. Though her singing is sometimes unremarkable, at times sound like a slurry Hope Sandoval trapped in a bell jar (this is a compliment). At these moments, Forever's frozen lullabies provide mix immediate gratification with a hint of mystery."

Given the ever-shortening waiting period for nostalgia (hey, man, remember when the Patriots won the Super Bowl?) it's just a matter of time before the first ""hits of the 90s"" radio stations start popping up across the country. And when ""Seether"" starts rockin' the airwaves again, you better believe Verula Salt will be touring America's low-capacity venues, perhaps co-headlining with Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Jesus Jones.Nine years removed from their biggest hits, Cracker would seem to be state-fair circuit material themselves. Yet, to their credit, David Lowery & Co appear to be trying their hardest to avoid this fate and remain a vital, relevant act with their newest album, Forever. Of course, when your band's lasting image for most people is the lead singer boxing Sandra Bernhard, that's an uphill battle to be fighting.Cracker's secret weapon against obscurity, apparently, is to take refuge under the roots-rock banner, releasing Forever on the Virgin imprint Back Porch Records and wearing a whole lot of denim in the album art. While perhaps a further insult to hardcore Camper Van Beethoven fans desperately praying for Lowery to turn around his musical de-evolution, the choice at least reflects a purpose more thought out than, ""Hey, remember us? Please, please, please buy our new album!"" But roots-rock itself has always been something of a questionable cause, usually implying something along the lines of ""we're tired of experimenting; let's just make music that's already been made a thousand times before.""Save a few exceptions, that's mostly the vibe Forever projects, with the band (whittled down to a core of Lowery and guitarist Johnny Hickman) content to reside along a familiar country-rock-soul axis. You've got your acoustic guitar base, your occasional slide guitar fill, your Dylan-esque organ, your chug-a-lug drums, and your mildly catchy melodies. It would be offensive if it wasn't so obvious that Cracker doesn't aspire to much more than this rustic middle-America mediocrity act.Or do they? Mark Linkous returns the favor of Lowery co-writing the brilliant Sparklehorse anthem ""Sick of Goodbyes"" by producing the leadoff ""Brides of Neptune"" and tweaking Cracker's sound by throwing some eerie synth voices and a tinny drum loop into the mix. And while it's not quite Jim O'Rourke re-inventing Wilco, it is a compelling opening to the album. Hickman's lone solo composition, ""Superfan"", also augments the Cracker formula with an underlying drone and some ""Baba O'Riley"" violin, indicating that he's more than just Lowery's hired-gun soloist.But then again, experimentation also gives us ""What You're Missing"", a self-referential joke that painfully allows these Crackers to near-rap about their respective roles in the band. That sound you hear is Biggie rapidly spinning around in his oversized, solid-gold coffin. Humorous intention or no, can we please put a ban on white rock bands rapping?Elsewhere, Lowery's singing voice retains the same old one-dimensional, inflexible rasp which, given the uniformity of the music, works more often than not. Less successful are attempts to soften it with two-bit Sheryl Crow-ish harmony/backing vocals, which give ""Shine"" and ""Guarded by Monkeys"" a distastefully slick sheen. In fact, the album's overall polished countenance doesn't seem to jive with the band's supposed rootsy goals.So, no, Forever isn't the album that's going to rescue Cracker from the discount used bins and return them to radio prominence, but at the very least, it establishes them on the respectable side of the soon-to-be-oldies continuum: more our generation's Cheap Trick than our Doobie Brothers. And something tells me that's about all they're shooting for."

Struggling with invasive tabloid coverage amid the death of his mother and a broken engagement, he mused, “Do I still got time to grow?/Things ain’t always set in stone.” Daniel Caesar would later cover “Street Lights” on one of his early EPs, 2015’s Pilgrim’s Paradise. Though he was barely 20 when he recorded it, Caesar’s version (retitled “Streetcar”) captured angst beyond his years. He ditched the electro-R&B but retained the emo confessionalism, backing his falsetto with piano, drums, and guitar. It was a preview of the minimal, ethereal tone of his full-length debut, 2017’s Freudian. The music that followed wasn’t as polished or poetic. “I wanted to free myself from replicating Freudian,” Caesar told interviewer Tom Power in 2020. His new album, Never Enough, poses the question: What if ChatGPT wrote half of 808s & Heartbreak?Traveling far afield from the gospel arrangements and acoustic ballads that defined his debut, Caesar has collaborated with Justin Bieber, T-Pain, and Free Nationals, picking up pieces of their sounds along the way. He’s erratically experimental on Never Enough—Auto-Tune, pitched-down vocals, random rap verses, Frank Ocean-like ad-libs. “Shot My Baby,” a bluesy tale of infidelity turned manslaughter, is the most intriguing departure from his typical autofiction. He’d been working on “a country-bluegrass type album,” he’s said, but switched directions when longtime producers Jordan Evans and Matthew Burnett weren’t sure what to do with the music. Instead, he lands on woozy psych-R&B that sounds like sleepy karaoke, or else the kind of music you hear in the background of ABC crime-drama trailers.The album is, in a word, sedated. Many songs open with about 20 seconds of eerily muted or distorted synth. The Slowed + Reverbed midsection of “Ocho Rios” accentuates Caesar’s melancholy and lyrics about prescription pills. “Toronto 2014” romanticizes life before the money and the Grammys. Yet no matter how hoarse or comatose he sounds—“You’re my saving grace… grace… grace”—propulsive drums, divine strings, and gossamer harmonies help to camouflage the weaknesses.Never Enough leans into the superficially cerebral subject matter of 2019’s Case Study 01, which sampled a theoretical physicist and dedicated a song to a brain lobe. That album was about as pseudo-academic as it gets. But if you’ve ever taken a scenic late-night drive, put on Channel Orange, and were unlucky enough to be accompanied by a suitor hoping to seduce you with Maslow hierarchies and Jordan Peterson quotes, Never Enough will give you flashbacks. “Do I titillate your mind?” Caesar asks on “Do You Like Me?” (Would you believe me if I told you it was co-written by Raphael Saadiq?) Lyrical absurdity peaks on “Vince Van Gogh”: “Used to be ugly, now I’m a handsome Charlie Manson/Wrapped in a Snuggie.” And lest we forget this completely original red-pill observation: “We’re stuck in the Matrix.”"

Add to this small world a child and it seems like a miracle—a small paradise immune to the horrors outside of it. “If you feel this world is not heading the right way,” Björk said recently, “you have to be DIY and make a little fortress.” It’s within this matriarchal frame that Björk and her co-producer Alejandro Ghersi (aka Arca) created the challenging album Utopia. It’s a long, skittering discovery of googly-eyed romance, a rebuke of the violence inherited by men, and a generous offering of love song after love song, rendered musically with unerring elegance and passion.The four decades of Björk’s music can be seen, simply enough, as a long trek to detail every last tendril of spiritual energy and spark of emotion that has existed in the world. Her relationship to feeling is particularly spatial, living within environments built Björk-tough for all the screams and whispers of history: emotional landscapes, hidden places, internal nebulas, mutual coordinates. Her shift from avant-garde pop star to immersive multimedia artist is not brand-building in a career sense—rather, it’s in service of having more tools for this restless excavation of human senses, their origins and futures. If this seems high-minded, it’s because it is, but it’s also because Björk’s music now exists on ever grander musical staffs, her lingua franca is that which is rarely broached in casual conversation: How does it really feel to lose someone? How does it really feel to start loving again?"

Playboi Carti),0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0316,modern,7.9,Tijuana-based producer bests his lackluster debut with this compilation collecting his promising latest 12-inch and previously unreleased material.,"Fernando Corona is a producer from Tijuana who is one of the central figures in Baja, California's Nortec Collective. He started by releasing Matmos-ian traditional Mexican cut-ups as Terrestre, and in 2002, he debuted with the album Martes under the name Murcof. Along the way he's remixed, cut vinyl as the mastering engineer for the Static Discos label, and scored the independent film Nicotina. He's a busy guy with a lot of talent, this Fernando Corona. Remember the name.With Martes, Corona took fragments of 20th Century classical by composers like Morton Feldman and Arvo Pärt and combined the tense arrangements with micro beats. It was an interesting record with an unusual sound, but it wasn't ultimately great; something about the loops and repetition of Martes didn't seem to gel. Corona's conception called for freedom and openness, music unconstrained by the snap-to grid. For that we would have to wait another 18 months.The 12-inch single ""Ulysses"", released earlier this year, delivered completely on Martes' promise and immediately built anticipation for the next Murcof full-length, due by the end of 2004. On both ""Ulysses"" and the B-side ""Urano"", Corona ditched samples to write and record his own charts, melding percolating minimalist beats with his subtly dissonant and open-ended phrases for strings. On this CD, Leaf has rewarded those without turntables by compiling the two tracks from the ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, two previously unreleased tracks, and seven remixes of material from Martes.Beyond the exceptional ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, both unheard tracks here are good but sound like holdovers from the Martes sessions. ""Una"" loops and chops a short section for strings and sets the melody against an undercurrent of catgut groans and plucks. It's like a duet between two instruments from the violin family-- one set to play ""music"" and the other focusing on ""sounds."" ""Ultimatum"", which foregrounds the drum programming and uses bits of piano and violin more as seasoning, is probably the funkiest track Corona has released as Murcof.The remixes are mostly strong, with the two best coming from familiar names. Jan Jelinek's ""Der Abschied von Dawson City Mix"" of ""Maiz"" is an excellent meeting of the minds that finds Jelinek using clipped fragments of plucked violin and double-bass slides for his own jazzed-up rhythmic ends. Deathprod's take on ""Ulysses"" leaves little of the original identifiably intact, but creates the kind of vast, doom-laden half-speed drift that will be instantly familiar to those familiar with his excellent Morals and Dogma.Colleen's mix of ""Muium"" is inspired and imaginative, as Cécile Schott burrows deep inside the original track, emerging with handfuls of individual notes that are stretched into drones and reassembled into weird melodies. On the beat-friendly tip, Sutekh's ""Triasgion mix"" of ""Memoria"" is highly danceable and driving techno infested with squirming samples pushing in several directions simultaneously, while fellow Nortec Collective member Fax (Ruben Tamayo, not Pete Namlook) offers a dubby and comparatively warm take on ""Maiz"".Fernando Corona's distinctive stamp is clearly affixed to every note of his originals, so his music lends itself to the remix treatment. But most exciting on Ulysses are the two new tracks that (hopefully) point the way toward the next Murcof album. What Corona brings to the table is something depressingly rare in electronic music: a fresh ear. Like Ekkehard Ehlers, Corona seems to hear music differently, allowing him to compose tracks that sound like no one else."

I was on the beach this weekend on a sunny day, and the air was still freezing. The local clam shack and ice cream stand had opened but the people in line were wearing windbreakers; this year's scoop girls are only just starting to build the biceps that they'll take to school next fall.It doesn't get hot enough in Portland, Oregon for music like this, and maybe that's why Chad Crouch and Blanket Music recorded Move in the South Pacific, on balmy Island 734-001 of the Bikini Atoll. They're joined by the beautiful voices of Esperanza Spalding (of Noise for Pretend) and Corrina Repp, who sound as smooth as ice against a hot torso. ""Shut up and sway your hips,"" they implore, and the tropical songs and warm recording couldn't sound more like an afternoon at a bar by the beach. They even put a cocktail umbrella in the spine of the disc, to illustrate what you're missing.Crouch says this is party music, and it is, though it's also good hangover music: soothing and free of shrill noise. The hooks are so subtle and laid-back that it can take a few listens to appreciate Crouch's catchy songwriting-- most notably on ""K - A - R - A [breathless] O - K [keep it coming] EEEeeeeeeeee,"" where his droopy-dog vocals and clever lyrics dance over a catchy guitar riff. Greg Lind's drumming is limber but restrained, and even the drum machine that augments the music is nicely integrated-- as on the hot jazz-meets-IDM ""Itchy Popcorn,"" which builds to speaker-shaking bass. Crouch is a low-key frontman with a thin, melodic voice, perfect for the tone of this record, and he and Ross Seligman play killer staccato lines on guitar.I'd expect American bossa nova to be as bad as other Americanized ethnic creations, like American ska, or American chop suey. In addition to having a stand-up band, Crouch succeeds by not pretending to be anything he isn't-- instead of posing as a smooth island loverboy, he sticks to wry lyrics and mundane topics. He has three jobs: as a musician, as a designer, and as the head of this label; and he likes to talk about the need to slow down. Like the 'to do' list that's set to a beautiful tune on ""Walk the Dog,"" or his potshots at hip visual artists in ""Hot Designers."" He writes witty love songs about (though not necessarily to) his ""incredible"" girlfriend, who he describes so sweetly in the liner notes that I winced hoping they haven't broken up since this came out. For example, the cutesy interplay in ""Tap the Beat"" (He: ""And if I lost my legs..."" She: ""I would put you on my back/ And I would grab things off the shelf for you""). Hey, guys, get a room!On a song like ""Costa Del Sol"" there's genuine yearning in Crouch's voice, the note of sincerity that makes it compelling and not just exotic. What does he yearn for? Maybe his girlfriend, though she probably hangs around plenty; maybe something as global as world peace, as on ""Get Togetha."" But more than anything, it sounds like Crouch wanted to vacation in a warm place and to party. And on the defrosting boardwalks, in the last gusts of New England's waning chill, that's good enough for me."

He’s not 17 in Riverdale casting years. He presents as an actual high schooler, complete with braces and glasses that look straight off of a CVS rack—a pointed departure break from the outsized stylist budgets and Manic Panic color palettes of rap’s biggest, youngest stars. That’s about where the distinction from his peers ends, though. Tecca’s look may be unique, but his sound isn’t.The Queens-born rapper rhymes in the melodic patter of New York sing-rap phenom A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, with a flow that splits the difference between Chief Keef’s gruff irritability and Gunna’s glycerin slickness. He’s got a strong voice and natural instincts, and although his flow is completely secondhand, it’s precisely pitched to the moment, especially when his songs glower their way into Juice WRLD incel-rap territory. That rapper looms especially large over We Love You Tecca. Juice WRLD’s producers Nick Mira and Taz Taylor helmed Tecca’s breakthrough hit “Ransom,” and he contributes the album’s only guest feature, on a remix of that track.Tecca’s success story has played like a smaller scale echo of Lil Nas X’s, another internet-savvy young rapper who built a listenership online too big for major labels to ignore. After millions of streams on SoundCloud and a viral video for “Ransom” on the taste-making YouTube channel Lyrical Lemonade, Tecca inked a deal with Republic Records, making him labelmates with Drake and Ariana Grande. His rise may not have stirred an all-consuming debate about genre classifications or resuscitated Billy Ray Cyrus’s career, but it’s always impressive seeing an artist so young cut through the industry’s yellow tape so quickly. Some rappers grind their whole lives for their moment. Tecca netted his between Xbox Live sessions.Still, he could benefit from putting a little more work in. It’s not for nothing that Tecca harps about guarding his flow on “Ransom,” because throughout We Love You Tecca he clings to it like a tennis player trying to fake his way into the pros with only one serve. That flow sounds fantastic on “Ransom,” and even better as it figure-skates through the tuneful “Shots.” But Tecca wears it into the ground over the course of the album’s repetitious 40 minutes, especially in its second half, as his tracks bleed into one endless rewrite of each other."

His constant dissatisfaction leaves no question that his true colors are loud and clashing.,"The first thing to know about the music of NNAMDÏ is that he has a million vehicles for it. The multi-instrumentalist, singer, and rapper born (and formerly known as) Nnamdi Ogbonnaya jumps at every opportunity. He’s a label head. He’s a gifted instrumental polyglot. He’s stylistically ravenous: two of his many side gigs include drumming in mind-warping time signatures for an instrumental math-rock band and playing bass and singing backup in another known for plainspoken poignancy and extremely simple parts. His holistic hustle has earned him widespread admiration among DIY peers in Chicago; when Melkbelly got a call to open for Foo Fighters at Wrigley Field, their singer wore a NNAMDÏ T-shirt.The second thing to know about the music of NNAMDÏ is that he sings with the patternless precision of a Whac-A-Mole champion. He bounds deliriously between voices and phrasing styles, up and down his vocal register, as if alter egos are fighting over the controls. It’s a universal accelerant: It conveys both a sort of invincibility when he sounds ecstatic and of unraveling when he sounds tortured. On BRAT, the latest of several albums released under variations of his own name, his internal deliberations grapple over ego, selfishness, and the gift or indulgence of a life devoted to art. “I’m a big brat/I can’t pick a side,” he sings, with an audible grin.Hearing all of this materialize into NNAMDÏ’s most ambitious album is exciting, but not always fun. The moments when he sounds invincible give way to equally intense self-doubts, and his songs overflow with confessional lyrics. “Bullseye” lands the album’s first instant hook, a short blast of Vitamin D that exists on an astral plane inhabited by Tierra Whack and maybe no one else. But as quickly as it hits, it withdraws on “Everyone I Loved,” where NNAMDÏ laments drifting apart from his family, who are “all having trouble understanding why I chose this route.” (The son of Nigerian immigrants, including a double PhD holder, NNAMDÏ earned a degree in electrical engineering and has discussed in interviews how his restless ambition is connected to his upbringing.) “Everything I loved now turns me off,” he sings in an Earth, Wind & Fire falsetto, up until that last word, which he drops with a spiritless thud.BRAT opens acoustically, closes thunderously, and along the way squirms across ground-scraping beats, twinkling guitars, and most sounds in between. It’s sure to divide listeners who tend towards maximalism from those who don’t, and it certainly provokes questions about what gets lost in genre fusion. But NNAMDÏ’s constant dissatisfaction with any one sound leaves no question that his true colors are loud and clashing, and he’s not afraid to admit to uncertainty. This is what’s powerful about the final two tracks of BRAT, where a longer arc starts to take form. On “It’s OK” and “Salut,” he stands still, straightens his spine, and lets out an overdue exhale. “There’s no need to pretend you’re OK if you’re not,” he concludes, finally sounding satisfied.NNAMDÏ is a clear natural talent, and also a malfunctioning fountain of ideas spraying in every direction. In saying a million things, BRAT doesn’t quite say any one bold thing. Most of NNAMDÏ’s recorded work has sounded like this—occasionally overwhelming and alienating—but sooner or later, he’s likely to focus all of these ideas into a tighter-tuned vision and construct a masterpiece. The singular voice, the personal rawness, and the sheer skill for craft are all there on BRAT, ready to snap together."

Now, he’s got the weight of YSL’s RICO case on his shoulders. Since he was released from jail in December, the generally tiresome social media conversation—driven by salacious Instagram and YouTube rags, plus a few rappers looking for attention—has focused on whether he “snitched.” But Gunna’s priority isn’t really responding to internet jokes. Instead, on his new album a Gift & a Curse, he’s trying to describe the emotional strain of a case that has torn apart brotherhoods and changed his outlook on life. He’s also attempting to keep the fun and lighthearted spirit of his prior music. The result is an album that is too vague to have much depth and too absorbed in real-life drama to have the feel-good vibes he wants to preserve.Lead single “Bread & Butter” sets the tone, balancing anger at friends who have turned their back on him with wistfulness for the old days when none of this was on his mind. It’s the kind of confessional, melodic pain rap that is popular in the Deep South, but the AutoTune-heavy singing is too monotone and polished for it to be effective; listen to how a crooner like Tampa’s T9ine lilts to make up for not having a big voice. Gunna could also attempt lyrical vulnerability, emulating the blunt poetics of an artist like Jacksonville’s Lil Poppa. But he is mostly still caught up trying to puff out his chest.I get it. He rose to the top of the Atlanta hip-hop ranks by being cool; it’s hard to dig in when he’s never really had to. Still, it’s frustrating when you can tell that he’s not being entirely real with you. Such is the case on the overly guarded and painfully slow “Paybach,” where he alludes to friends accusing him of betraying Young Thug by taking the Alford plea: “Switching on my brother are you serious?” he coos. I can assume that he’s wounded and confused by that accusation—but I have to assume, because instead of letting us in, he follows up with the flex “Nigga ain’t gon’ touch me and that’s period.” Similarly, “Idk Nomore” avoids all feelings with threats and hollow platitudes. At one point he sings, “Wanna know how Wunna feel? then listen to my music”—as if that isn’t what we are doing.He’s better off on songs like “Fukumean,” where he goes back-to-the-basics—smoking good weed, thinking about boobs—deploying the explosive, run-on flow he nailed down around Drip Harder. Or on “Ca$h $hit,” where he continues to be nondescript emotionally but exhibits some imagination in the countless ways he describes getting fits off: “I drip like sweat in the sauna” and “Pop out, when I drip it’s a puddle.” The breezy beat of “Ca$h $hit,” with its low-key woodwinds whirling in the background, is one of the rare instrumentals that has any life to it. Notably, both of these songs come in the middle of the 15-track album, smashed in between lots of seriousness. They’ll be solid singles, but here, they really tear you from the moment.Gunna is yet another rap star struggling with the expectation that if you hit a low point, you have to be prepared to let it all out by the next annual release date. Of all the tracks on a Gift & a Curse, “Rodeo Dr” feels truest to where he’s at right now. The beat is brisk, the flows switch, and luxury goods are still in sight but he airs some frustration: “Fuck this shit, you know I’m still doing it for Jeff and Lil Keed,” he raps, and that “Fuck this shit” is more moving than any part where being moving is the point. Clearly, Gunna isn’t ready or willing to fully pull at his emotions. I’d rather hear the album he wants to make over the one he feels like he’s supposed to. Maybe now that he’s gotten a Gift & a Curse out of the way, he’ll feel free."

This is the guy who entered the realm of semi-stardom 15 years ago with “Losing My Edge,” a song that both poked fun at and paid tribute to music snobbery, that imagined a miracle man who witnessed every “seminal” underground event up-close, that used a list of cooler-than-thou names as an impenetrable shield. It made sense for him to concoct his very own “I was there” moment on April 2, 2011, when LCD Soundsystem played what was billed as their final show at the most storied venue in New York City. It was instantly legendary, the underdog’s big day. A perfect ending. Too perfect, maybe.As an ace student of the game—“LCD is a band about a band writing music about writing music,” he once quipped—Murphy knew that he couldn’t just reunite for a lucrative victory lap, playing his most popular songs on Spotify to the genre-agnostic, dance-friendly demographic he helped cultivate throughout the 2000s. It would ruin the legacy and go against everything LCD stood for: integrity, respect, a sly but genuine love of just how much music can shape a human being’s identity. So even though a new album was always planned since the band officially reformed 20 months ago, the intervening hit-filled gigs could feel odd. Yes, they sounded great, and all the members looked excited to be playing together again, but the context was tweaked. LCD Soundsystem were no longer on the cusp of a cultish zeitgeist. Murphy still sang “this could be the last time” during “All My Friends,” though the line’s tang of finality was dulled.For his part, Murphy recently promised to never make a show of LCD’s retirement ever again. But as much as the band’s fourth album, American Dream, marks a rebirth, it’s also obsessed with endings: of friendships, of love, of heroes, of a certain type of geeky fandom, of the American dream itself. These are big, serious topics for a project that essentially started as a goof, but it’s the direction Murphy has taken since Sound of Silver’s “Someone Great” combined his affection for bubbling synths with a poignancy about the fleeting nature of life. Now, as a 47-year-old father of a young child, Murphy is using his long-running affection for bygone post-punk and art-rock sounds to carry on traditions; the album includes pointed references to Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen, Suicide’s Alan Vega, and David Bowie, all of whom passed in the years since LCD’s last record. Whereas Murphy once took on all of these influences lightly and cleverly, they feel heavier across much of American Dream’s 70 minutes, with the lingering responsibilities of a disappearing history becoming more apparent."

Over the course of his immortal four-project run in the mid-2010s—Monster, Beast Mode, 56 Nights, and Dirty Sprite 2—the word became the defining trait of his persona. As he emerged as one of rap’s biggest superstars, it was like his conscience was telling him one thing and his masculinity another. But “toxic” also flattened the emotional complexity and thoughtfulness of Future’s songwriting. He wrote brooding sagas about self-inflicted heartbreak; candid reflections on the drugs that he blamed for his pain and relied on to heal it, too; turn-up joints about a life of luxury layered with the sense that he was overcompensating for lost love. Often on these tapes, he could go through all those feelings in one verse, blurring reality and myth.But since then, despite some great moments—specifically 2017’s HNDRXX—Future has increasingly become a caricature of himself. His writing started to feel one-dimensional, embellishing the Future persona with even more devious lines. His stories used to contain mistakes and melodrama, but lately it feels like the goal is to get one over on the women he sings about. His latest album I Never Liked You—the title sounds like a breakup note passed in the back of a middle-school classroom—has the ingredients of a really good Future album but lacks the depth of one. It plays it safe by continuing to lean too hard on the schtick.Still, Future is such a slick rapper and vocalist that his songs are pretty fun even when the lyrics feel routine. “I’m Dat Nigga” introduces a bunch of subtle yet exciting change-ups to his flow: He accelerates for a couplet, slows down for the next, and by the end, he’s in full boastful monologue mode. The eeriness of “Puffin on Zootiez” might make you believe Future is saying more than he actually is, but it’s OK because his downbeat yet rapid delivery and the ornate instrumental carry the song. The repetitive but memorable “Chickens” is a highlight, as Future embraces the cartoonish side of his character and gets a fresh burst of energy from EST Gee’s menace.But Gee is the only collaboration on the album that feels inspired; the others are so formulaic that they’re indistinguishable. Check “Wait For U” with Drake: Sampling Tems’ “Higher” is a cheat code to a catchy song, but Future and Drake are on such autopilot that I’d rather listen to the original. The other joint with Drake, “I’m on One,” wouldn’t have even made the cut for What a Time to Be Alive. “For a Nut,” with Young Thug and Gunna, is the bottom of the barrel. The song is supposed to be a sleazy, darkly funny good time, but the lyrics are so half-assed that they come off more like a parody."

Before he ever shook hands with Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, Marshall Mathers battled Project Blowed members and Chicago’s future candidates for alderman. This, after all, was a nasally white rapper from Detroit with a rhyming dictionary and a taste for horrorcore. His first EP from 1997 was sort of staggering, but didn’t exactly scream “TRL.”If you ran the simulation a thousand times, it would never spit out the actual results: the tens of millions of records sold, the merchandising and the Academy Award and the million little cottage industries. But that’s what happened, and so by 2000, the nasally white rapper from Detroit with a rhyming dictionary had a diamond-selling album that pissed off Bill Clinton and his former group The Outsidaz in equal measure.It’s tempting to dismiss the endurance of Eminem’s career as the half-life of celebrity, and the man himself as a relic from the Clinton- and Bush-era boom years. But Music to Be Murdered By, released without warning last week, is defined by a certain kind of defiance, and even a peculiar integrity. It’s a messy, sometimes lucid example of a hyper-technical style of rap that fell out of favor and is now creeping back into vogue. It is not, strictly speaking, a good record—Eminem hasn’t made one of those in a decade—but it boasts enough technical command and generates just enough arresting ideas to hold your attention.It opens with a long notebook dump called “Premonition,” in which Eminem vents his frustration with critics—he correctly notes that he’s been mocked for sounding too tame and too angry on consecutive records—and fans who want him to chase trends driven by rappers half his age. His concessions to this real or imagined pressure have, in the past, been disastrous: 2018’s Kamikaze wastes a Tay Keith beat on a middling “Bad and Boujee” riff, and his adoption of the Migos’ triplet flow on 2017’s Revival (“I conned her into/Ripping the condom in two) was ineffective, to say the least. That’s why it’s so striking when the same fixation yields radically more interesting results here. “Premonition” is followed by “Unaccommodating,” a duet with the inhumanly charismatic 27-year-old Young M.A; “Godzilla” pairs Eminem with Juice WRLD, who tragically died at 21 last month. On both songs, the younger performer sounds freer and looser than the headliner, but each ranks among the most effective cuts."

It’s sure to divide listeners who tend towards maximalism from those who don’t, and it certainly provokes questions about what gets lost in genre fusion. But NNAMDÏ’s constant dissatisfaction with any one sound leaves no question that his true colors are loud and clashing, and he’s not afraid to admit to uncertainty. This is what’s powerful about the final two tracks of BRAT, where a longer arc starts to take form. On “It’s OK” and “Salut,” he stands still, straightens his spine, and lets out an overdue exhale. “There’s no need to pretend you’re OK if you’re not,” he concludes, finally sounding satisfied.NNAMDÏ is a clear natural talent, and also a malfunctioning fountain of ideas spraying in every direction. In saying a million things, BRAT doesn’t quite say any one bold thing. Most of NNAMDÏ’s recorded work has sounded like this—occasionally overwhelming and alienating—but sooner or later, he’s likely to focus all of these ideas into a tighter-tuned vision and construct a masterpiece. The singular voice, the personal rawness, and the sheer skill for craft are all there on BRAT, ready to snap together."

Today, we revisit the major-label debut from the sludge-metal pioneers, an album that marked their transition from rockers to experimentalists.","Even as a kid, Buzz Osborne had the hair: that splendid shock of aerodynamic curls that rose above the crowd like a sail at the 2010 World Series playoffs, a crown befitting the name King Buzzo. Born in the remote Washington lumber town of Morton, Osborne moved around the state with his dad, who worked in the timber industry, before the family settled in Montesano in coastal Grays Harbor County. Twelve-year-old Osborne was an outsider: a new face in a tight-knit community, a musical omnivore in a place where record stores were nonexistent and playing the high school dance was the peak of most musicians’ ambitions. The hair didn’t help. “He was a freak and no one liked him,” said Matt Lukin, one of the first like-minded kids Osborne met in Montesano, with whom he’d form one of the Northwest’s most influential heavy rock bands, the Melvins.Osborne’s dad wanted him to sign up for the Army, but when Buzz fell sick he went to the local recruiter’s office and got a permanent excuse from service; instead, he got a job at the local Thriftway, where a disliked employee named Melvin became the inspiration for the name of his band. He met Lukin at Montesano High School, and their social circle would expand to include Osborne’s coworker Mike Dillard and a couple of kids named Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. During this time, Osborne positioned himself as a relentless rock’n’roll evangelist, spreading the gospel of ’70s groups like Kiss and Cheap Trick and punk bands like Black Flag and MDC to his friends. He burned compilation tapes, made pilgrimages to the DJ’s Sound City record shop in nearby Aberdeen to talk music with clerk Tim Hayes, and even wrote an article for the Montesano Vidette arguing the value of small shows; years later, Novoselic would credit him with bringing punk rock to their community.When Osborne formed the Melvins in 1983, with Lukin on bass and Dillard on drums, he found a new vehicle for his crusade—and a way out of Montesano, as the band started gradually playing gigs closer and closer to the nearest major city, Seattle. The Melvins played covers of Jimi Hendrix, the Who, and Osborne’s beloved Kiss, mixed in with fast hardcore punk. That changed in 1984, when Black Flag confounded their fellow punk rockers by concluding their album My War with three six-minute-plus tracks that pulled away from the breakneck speed of hardcore toward the wounded crawl of doom metal."

The 21-year-old Compton-raised crooner can’t decide if he wants to make moody and raw piano-driven street tales like his breakout single “Die Young,” motivational high school basketball warm-up anthems like “Every Season,” or polished and sunny Young Thug-inspired pop songs like his Mustard-produced “Ballin’.” Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial is not the slogan of an Etsy boutique that prints the phrase on Gildan hoodies and caps with adjustable strapbacks, but the title of his debut. The name has nothing to do with his music; it’s just an attempt to manufacture an identity or maybe inspire a few Instagram captions.But say this for Roddy: No matter the trend he’s chasing, he usually wrings a solid song from it. Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial begins in the most cliche way possible—with a “Dreams and Nightmares”-style intro. As soon as the first somber piano key hits and Roddy starts wailing and reflecting on his upbringing, we know exactly where the track is headed, but he hits the marks well, including the intense beat switch, the motivational flex bars, the details about how he overcame the obstacles and secured the bag. It works. So does“Big Stepper,” when he, of course, meditates on the past over an acoustic guitar-sampling instrumental. His storytelling is rote, but gets over on the warmth of the melody.There’s not a flow Roddy Ricch isn’t comfortable borrowing. On “Start Wit Me,” Roddy fills in for Lil Baby as Gunna’s partner in listing fashion brands, a low stakes song that just fills Gunna’s weekly appearance on a major label rap album quota—there’s no way Gunna is keeping track of his features at this point. “High Fashion,” his second collaboration of the year with Mustard, is a Young Thug rip so egregious that it probably could have been generated by an AI, but he sings his heart out, and  the beat that puts a bright West Coast spin on ’90s R&B.The few instances where Roddy breaks free from imitation provide standouts. On “War Baby,” Roddy seamlessly harmonizes with a gospel choir  like the chameleon he is. And on “The Box,” over a hard-hitting beat that sounds like a teapot is boiling in the background, he finds a new delivery and pitch nearly every 10 seconds. The track is the best example of Roddy’s versatility, which has been both a blessing and a curse. Most rappers would sell their soul for his ability to shape his melody to latch onto any relevant sound, but everything here feels so safe. Roddy’s too good a songwriter to settle for being so vapid."

The “I don’t really care if you cry” taunt that shouldn’t be believed melting into “All my friends are dead/Push me to the edge” is a stretch of masterful songwriting, but withering in a way that few artists could mimic without tipping into self-parody. Its commercial benchmarks—No. 7 on Billboard, Platinum three times over—don’t come close to capturing the depth with which people feel the song. It will probably define Lil Uzi Vert for the rest of his career.Which is fine, because artists have been plagued by hits with just a fraction of the pathos “XO Tour Llif3” has. But Uzi has been an ascendant star for at least a year and a half: from promising rookie to SoundCloud darling to rap’s A-list and beyond. He’s proven himself a popular force with solo cuts like “Money Longer” and guest turns on Migos’ “Bad and Boujee” and Playboi Carti’s “Woke Up Like This”; dozens, hundreds of imitators across digital mixtape platforms cite him as a major creative influence, or at least a welcome distillation of whatever’s happening in and around the Atlanta scene. And yet in some small way, Uzi’s long-awaited Luv Is Rage 2 is a referendum on whether he can live up to the standard “XO Tour Llif3” set. The goal isn’t a streaming figure or a chart position, but a feeling.Lofty as that is, Luv Is Rage 2 comes very close to delivering. At its best, the album mines the psyches of exhausted and exhausting people, searching for the moment where enough drugs or heartbreak or iMessages or sleep deprivation can unlock a new part of the brain. It’s the Philadelphia native’s most musically developed work and features a bulk of his most interesting songs to date.Take “The Way Life Goes,” which is produced by Don Cannon and Ike Beatz. Uzi opens with a brief introduction to the other half of his failed relationship, punctuated with, “I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her.” From there, he launches into a full interpolation of the first verse from Oh Wonder’s “Landslide”: “I know it hurts sometimes, but you’ll get over it/You’ll find another life to live.” Uzi’s less interested in the granular drama of the breakup than in the fallout, the moment three or four days later when reality starts to set in."

It’s led to arguably his most defining trait: the incredibly specific and memorable Drakeisms, which are sometimes delivered with the belief that they’re profound—making them unintentionally funny, too. Think of the melodramatic and self-loathing details that fill up Take Care (“I think I’m addicted to naked pictures/And sittin’ talkin’ ’bout bitches that we almost had”); the batshit diatribe at the end of “Diamonds Dancing”; the mafioso myth making on If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late (“I order that Alfredo Pasta/Then eat in the kitchen like I’m in the mafia”). Even on Views, his most self-serious album, his ego is so goosed up that surely he must know how ridiculous he sounds. But maybe not.In recent years, Drake’s growing desire to be in on the joke has made his writing way less exciting. That’s how we ended up with the failure-to-launch “Toosie Slide” viral dance challenge, the desperation of 2021’s Certified Lover Boy, and now the up-and-down nature of his newest album Honestly, Nevermind. The album threads styles like house and Baltimore and Jersey club into his moody, washed-out foundation. It sounds refreshingly different from any other Drake album, and he brings back his go-to trick of legitimizing trend-hopping by recruiting genre heavyweights into his orbit: South African DJ Black Coffee and chameleonic electronic producer Carnage (under his house alias Gordo) both have major contributions to the production. It’s light and breezy, and the songs flow right into each other like a DJ mix, not unlike 2017’s More Life. All this should work, but it feels a little empty for one glaring reason: Drake’s writing lacks its former zest.Honestly, Nevermind’s most memorable line isn’t actually on the album. In a weepy Apple Music note that accompanied the release, he wrote, “I can’t remember the last time someone put they phone down, looked me in the eyes and asked my current insight on the times.” It is hilarious—a level of self-obsession and delusion missing on the record. On “Calling My Name,” where a pulsing house beat does all the work, Drake talks about lost love with details that amount to, “You’re my water, my refresher/Take off your clothes, relieve pressure.” When he’s not saying anything worthwhile, you tend to zoom in on his singing, but his voice is too one-note to carry the load. Similarly on the 40-produced “Down Hill,” his lyrics about heartbreak are full of banalities. In the past, his genre-bouncing, even if watered-down, was made singular through his writing. Without that, you’re left with a flattened version of a superior, pre-existing sound."

Metro watches the mayhem unfold from the roof of a compound while Morgan Freeman dissuades him from intervening. “Your place in history is already cemented,” Freeman tells him. “You’ve built a legacy, something people will clearly kill for.” A stoic Metro then snatches a chain floating behind a glass case before hopping into a Batmobile-like whip and jetting into the city. It doesn’t make much sense, but it doesn’t have to: Like Metro’s music, the trailer is expensive, exciting, and crammed with vibrant characters—the plot or message hardly matters. Enjoy car chases and sinister 21 Savage verses? Spectacular explosions and generic Travis Scott hooks? Metro Boomin has an album for you.Heroes & Villains, though, is more than just fireworks and big-name features. It’s an ambitious, detail-rich record that splits the difference between streaming fodder and world-building. The rappers featured here are either aging out of the spotlight (Future), transitioning into corporate avatars (Travis Scott) or, unfortunately, serving time behind bars (Young Thug, Gunna). While Heroes & Villains scans as an opus of psychedelic trap and star-laden singles with cool comic book packaging, it almost feels like a last triumphant gasp from the past decade’s most prominent rappers and their favorite hitmaking producer.But Heroes & Villains proves that Metro aspires to more than hits. He first demonstrated his wide-scale vision on 2018’s Not All Heroes Wear Capes, a project in which his sparse, moody beats grew thicker, grander, and more intricate. When he attempted to swerve from his signature sound, though, his limited range was exposed: Metro is great when he makes Metro-type beats, shaky when he ventures outside of his comfort zone. On Heroes & Villains, he surpasses his standard quota of bangers while also taking a few fun risks. A symphonic, Francis and the Lights-esque intro? Why not. An interpolation of Mario Winans’ “I Don’t Wanna Know,” featuring the Weeknd and 21 Savage? Let’s do it. Metro is thinking outside the box a bit more, without sacrificing the foundation of what makes his music so appealing in the first place.Chief among these appeals is his ability to mine grade-A material from his guests. His beats are distinct enough to sound good on their own, yet understated enough to afford a vocalist stylistic freedom. Few artists melodically thrive over a Metro beat like Don Toliver, who delivers two of the album’s more magnetic vocal performances on “Too Many Nights” and “Around Me.” Even Future’s got a little pep in his step here, particularly on the anthemic “Superheroes (Heroes & Villains).” But it’s Young Thug, on “Metro Spider,” who steals the show. Slithering over a menacing string note and ominous piano, he snaps off a string of vivid, eccentric bars about luxury watches and feeling more famous than the president. Unlike other Thug verses that have emerged since his incarceration, “Metro Spider” hardly feels like a leftover—in fact, Metro positions it as the album’s centerpiece."

The sound is like a gauze bandage covering emotional wounds, but Scott lets the red bleed through nonetheless.","Questioning what you once held fundamentally true is exhausting, but in every possible way, Brooklyn-via-Nashville singer-songwriter Mackenzie Scott's intense, spiritual sophomore album as Torres suggests that this is work worth doing. Her 2013 self-titled debut felt inherently raw in its stripped-down folk-rock, a sound akin to that of her future collaborator Sharon Van Etten. On Sprinter, however, Scott shrouds her voice with feedback and heavier rock instrumentation, created alongside PJ Harvey producer and percussionist Rob Ellis. The sound is like a gauze bandage covering the emotional wounds, the profound isolation and fear of abandonment, that sit at the heart of Sprinter. But Scott lets a little red bleed through nonetheless, and for listeners, at least, that's a good thing.An album ago, Scott told what was presumed to be some version of her own adoption story with ""Moon & Back""; the song is written from the perspective of a woman who left a letter for the baby she gave up, but no names are given. Though Torres continues to write from perspectives besides her own—and it continues to prove interesting—on Sprinter, any trepidation she may have felt over first-person narrative is pushed aside in pursuit of unflinching honesty. On the album's stunning, solo acoustic closer ""The Exchange"", Scott is direct where before she was mysterious: ""Mother, father, I'm underwater, and I don't think you can pull me out of this,"" she coos in the chorus. ""Blew my per diem on an eighth of Blue Dream/ So I can breathe but I still can't breathe,"" Scott adds, revealing her coping method of choice—sativa-dominant hybrids. The song's arresting plainspokenness recalls Neko Case's memorable a cappella declaration of abandonment and rejection on The Worst Things Get, the Harder I Fight...'s ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"".Sprinter splits its mood between depression and rage, mirrored in the album's loud-quiet musical dichotomy that is not unlike that of early PJ Harvey albums. With the aid of her co-producer Ellis (showing off his status as an underrated rock drummer who makes every beat sound crisp), Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley (who recently helped Perfume Genius also reach a musical state as real as it is deeply unsettling), and Harvey bassist Ian Oliver, Scott fully inhabits her loudest moments by inching towards post-rock and synth-rock. The album's crowning achievement, ""Son, You Are No Island"", forges a mystical through line from Celtic music to Hole's ""I Think That I Would Die"", to Godspeed You! Black Emperor, to Mica Levi's Under the Skin soundtrack. This song simmers with rage, a stick of dynamite waiting to blow, but it's Scott's restraint in delaying the explosions—first a wall of hardened distortion, then via vocal loops—that hits the hardest."

She seems like a transitional spirit from another era—some dark and medieval place, a real-life Melisandre with an angelic tenor. Her music, a regal gothic folk, is equally soothing and haunting, and like singer-songwriters Angel Olsen and Laura Gibson, Nadler doesn’t need much behind her sonically to make an impact.In years past, it was simply her and and guitar, singing of loss and regret. She occasionally seemed shy or reserved, but she’s opened up more with each album, and on Strangers, Nadler offers traces of her life—discussing personal friends on “Janie in Love” and “Katie I Know,” and, on “All the Colors of the Dark,” walking us through the house of an old flame. “Divers of the Dust,” the album’s panoramic opener, wrestles with heartbreak, yet as always with Nadler, she leaves the words open for broad interpretation: “Lying here, on the rocks, with the cliffs disintegrating/Last I heard, in the end, the waves were scraping city streets.”Compared with Nadler’s 2014 LP, July, Strangers moves away from folk into more accessible terrain. Produced by Randall Dunn, who’s worked with Sunn O))), Earth, and the Cave Singers, these sounds are edgier, supplementing Nadler’s bleak aesthetic with layered strings, percussion and guitar, resulting in a rock-oriented sound that lends itself to a wider group of listeners. Even the more pastoral songs like “Skyscraper,” “Waking,” and “Dissolve,” feel heavier, not as gentle as her previous work. Nadler’s music is an acquired taste, but Strangers is probably her most expansive release to date.As with any Nadler recording, this isn’t a stark turn from her usual vibe. The strength of this album lies in its subtle shifts, the way it casually unfolds without getting stuck. Dunn produces heavy metal, which fits neatly within Nadler's grey-skies approach; even the acoustic songs have a fierceness to them. She's been isolated on her records before, but here the music feels spacious and robust like the workings of a full ensemble in which ideas are allowed to flow. There’s an overwhelming connectivity to her music: As Nadler exorcises her own demons, she brings you along with her, making you feel a little less anxious about your own despair. She sees poetry in the mundane, elegance in the gloom."

Previously, Green Velvet had regaled the world with his tales of being a toothless inbred victim of alien abduction who lost his anal virginity at the hands of his alien captors (""Abduction""), as well as Zoloft fantasies about being an immortal water molecule (""Water Molecule""). He's also previously made public ""Answering Machine,"" a week's worth of answering machine messages during the course of which he's dumped by his fiancée who's also pregnant by some other guy, his landlord is throwing him out on the street for the racket he makes, and his best friend has stolen his primo stash. No small wonder Green Velvet rages after each message, ""I can't take this shit."" ""Answering Machine"" was later remixed to big-room-buckling glory by edgy house masters, X-Press 2.For the follow-up to the 1999's Constant Chaos and the F-111 self-titled singles compilation, Green Velvet drops the chrome gleam of tech house and scoops up some filthy Teutonic electro-agit-punk. Never as distorted and slogan-slinging as Atari Teenage Riot, Whatever is assuredly aggro. Unlike the comfortably removed sci-fi of Constant Chaos, Whatever is altogether more down-to-earth and soiling. You don't have to be a skank to get off on this record, but if you are, it will assuredly assist your acclimatization to Green Velvet's funky ordure.After declaring that he's a genetic defect on ""Genedefekt,"" ""La La Land"" returns to the wanton haunts of naughty girls and boys that Green Velvet exposed on his 1995 debut single, ""Flash."" For his debut, Green Velvet took club kids' parents on guided tours of skeevy raves and encouraged the outraged, middle-aged delusionals to take photographs with the exhortation, ""Cameras ready! Prepare to Flash."" ""La La Land"" offers stern warnings about ""those little pills"" and the unreal ""thrills that they yield"" and the million brain cells that each pill kills. Underneath the manic preacher warnings, Green Velvet slides a demonic Euro electro track similar to the snarling crunky joints International Deejay Gigolos or Felix Da Housecat release.On ""Stranj,"" Green Velvet flips into a more Giorgio Moroder-derived, tech-trance mode for his exposition on how strange his world is after drugs and how his family is pressuring him to be an upstanding member of society, rather than the night-filth freak he really is. ""Sleepwalking"" is an earnest and heavily processed tribute to Cabaret Voltaire's 1985 masterpiece of the same name. Though Green Velvet adds his unique lyrics, everyone whose adored Cabaret Voltaire's song will love the spindly four-note melody figure and the cowbell breakdown. Green Velvet reserves most of his rage for ""GAT (The Great American Tragedy),"" which he defines as people's willingness to be told what to do. Green Velvet screams, ""They say it's a phase/ This is not a fucking phase,"" over a sympathetically militant searing gabba rhythm.Following the musical diary entry song, ""Waiting 4 the Day 2 End,"" in which Green Velvet informs us that he wanted grits with his salted scrambled eggs for breakfast that morning, ""Dank"" closes Whatever with Green Velvet portraying four reefer-jerks. Almost a cappella, ""Dank"" leaves the listener perplexed as to Green Velvet's no-narcotics sincerity. Since Green Velvet is a mask that musician Curtis Jones disguises his humanity in so that he can take long-stay excursions beyond the bizarre, no one should be surprised if they feel creeped out or sullied at the end of the album."

But becoming a real-deal group hasn’t radically changed the project.","It’s almost misleading to say that Bones is the first full-band Son Lux album. Ryan Lott—the film- and dance-score composer, former ad-music man, and mastermind of Son Lux since the 2008 release of At War with Walls & Mazes—has never been one to go it alone. He’s a constant collaborator, whether it be with Lorde, Boots, Shara Worden of My Brighest Diamond, or teaming up with Sufjan Stevens and rapper Serengeti for Sisyphus. To tour the material from Son Lux’s previous full-length, Lanterns, Lott put together a three-piece band that included guitarist Rafiq Bhatia and drummer Ian Chang, and the trio parlayed their onstage chemistry into recording sessions for Bones.Becoming a real-deal band hasn’t radically changed Son Lux. Lott’s vocals are still unmistakeable in their brittle breathiness, and the songs still come across like the multi-layered electronic manifestations of a classically trained pianist who studied composition in college but can’t suppress his inner beatmaker. But the collaboration with Bhatia and Chang—not to mention vocal contributions from Moses Sumney, DM Stith, Hanna Benn, Holychild’s Liz Nistico, Daughter’s Elena Tonra and others—perceptibly aerates the Son Lux sound. Lott has a tendency to pile his influences in a way that can sometimes feel suffocating, like confetti crammed into a party popper, and on Bones, his bandmates pulled the string while also adding their own crinkled strips of color to the explosion. It’s not unlike the way Dirty Projectors are unmistakably Dave Longstreth’s project, but his talented bandmates are crucial to presenting his vision.It tends to be the words that trip up Lott. He rarely writes traditionally structured songs, and he tends to go the mantra route with the words, to varying degrees of success. On Bones, though, the questions he poses have never been more pertinent. “Are we now what we’ll be? Are we fixed or free?” he asks on “Flight.” Bones is obsessed with exploring whether we can change our station and how or when to sound the alarm. There’s an undercurrent of class warfare and oppression, but Bones is not a protest album. These aren’t Occupy anthems or the soundtrack to protests in Ferguson or Charleston. Lott isn’t railing against a specific tragedy. It’s more general, and it can apply to your issue of choice. Lott merely realizes that it’s time to start railing."

But instead of constructing a hagiography to his mentor, he has paid tribute by carrying on, a consummate workaholic who tunes out pain by clocking in. This year’s Glockoma 2, now expanded in a deluxe edition, maintains the laser-sharp focus of his previous Southern hustle music while showing a deepening sense of maturity and resolve. As usual, there are no bonus guests or radio-baiting remixes, just straight-up bars.Glock’s self-reliance is squarely in the tradition of Memphis rap, a scene that has often worked on its own terms. But Glock embodies his hometown not just in business philosophy but in production. While producer Bandplay sticks to a classic Memphis underground sound, all bass kicks and thick claps, he uses samples that add new flair to Glock’s established style. There’s a vintage warmth to Glockoma 2 that recalls the city’s history as a vibrant Mecca of rhythm and blues, from the glistening strings on “2 for 1” or the bluesy guitar of “From Nothing.” Glock is frequently at his most nimble on these throwback numbers, like the turntablist-inflected “In & Outta Town,” which Bandplay constructs from the foundation of a beeping alarm.Across the album, Glock’s tight flow draws you inward, like he’s rapping in stealth mode. He isn’t laugh-out-loud funny, but there’s a sly wit to his imaginative bars, like when he compares the drip on his neck and wrist to the Nile River on “Ratchet.” You get the sense that Glock is protecting his heart, but gloom and pain lurk around every corner: “Still hanging with the reapers/Hanging with the demons,” as he says on “Sucker Free,” the opener to the deluxe edition. He lets ghostly samples articulate what he himself cannot: On “No Hook,” a pitch-shifted voice repeats the refrain “I hear voices,” a menacing counterpoint to Glock’s usual swagger. On tracks like “Let’s Go” and “Lean Habits,” Glock is backed up by chopped-up choirs, while distorted vocal flips lend a cloudy flavor to “Work” and “Fuck Dat Shit” that evokes Clams Casino beats.On their Dum and Dummer tapes, Glock and Dolph made for effortless tag team partners; the void of voices on Glockoma 2, save for Glock’s own, only magnifies how unique their chemistry was. But Glock is more than capable of standing on his own; as he puts it bluntly on the closing track, which outlines his continued indifference to co-signs, “Fuck the rap game, just pay myself for a feature.” For Glock, that independence is a principle he inherited from his mentor, who bucked the majors with his Paper Route Empire label. By continuing to put his ideals into action, Glock keeps Dolph’s legacy alive."

This is the guy who entered the realm of semi-stardom 15 years ago with “Losing My Edge,” a song that both poked fun at and paid tribute to music snobbery, that imagined a miracle man who witnessed every “seminal” underground event up-close, that used a list of cooler-than-thou names as an impenetrable shield. It made sense for him to concoct his very own “I was there” moment on April 2, 2011, when LCD Soundsystem played what was billed as their final show at the most storied venue in New York City. It was instantly legendary, the underdog’s big day. A perfect ending. Too perfect, maybe.As an ace student of the game—“LCD is a band about a band writing music about writing music,” he once quipped—Murphy knew that he couldn’t just reunite for a lucrative victory lap, playing his most popular songs on Spotify to the genre-agnostic, dance-friendly demographic he helped cultivate throughout the 2000s. It would ruin the legacy and go against everything LCD stood for: integrity, respect, a sly but genuine love of just how much music can shape a human being’s identity. So even though a new album was always planned since the band officially reformed 20 months ago, the intervening hit-filled gigs could feel odd. Yes, they sounded great, and all the members looked excited to be playing together again, but the context was tweaked. LCD Soundsystem were no longer on the cusp of a cultish zeitgeist. Murphy still sang “this could be the last time” during “All My Friends,” though the line’s tang of finality was dulled.For his part, Murphy recently promised to never make a show of LCD’s retirement ever again. But as much as the band’s fourth album, American Dream, marks a rebirth, it’s also obsessed with endings: of friendships, of love, of heroes, of a certain type of geeky fandom, of the American dream itself. These are big, serious topics for a project that essentially started as a goof, but it’s the direction Murphy has taken since Sound of Silver’s “Someone Great” combined his affection for bubbling synths with a poignancy about the fleeting nature of life. Now, as a 47-year-old father of a young child, Murphy is using his long-running affection for bygone post-punk and art-rock sounds to carry on traditions; the album includes pointed references to Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen, Suicide’s Alan Vega, and David Bowie, all of whom passed in the years since LCD’s last record. Whereas Murphy once took on all of these influences lightly and cleverly, they feel heavier across much of American Dream’s 70 minutes, with the lingering responsibilities of a disappearing history becoming more apparent."

A significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor.","The Albatross became a self-fulfilling prophecy for Foxing. While the St. Louis band's relentless touring enabled the slow-build success of their debut, the aching opening track on Dealer recounts the effect of Conor Murphy having to repeat ugly truths about himself night after night for the better part of two years: ""I am caught up in the guilt/ Making a living off of drowning."" Though Dealer is an artistic triumph and a significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor. And that's why, from its very first second, Murphy sounds drained over the prospect of doing it all over again—Dealer is not an easy listen. It sounds like it was very difficult to make, and reliving it is going to be even harder.It's in Foxing's nature to welcome a challenge. Of all the leading figures in the Fest-centered post-emo world, they made the most demanding, unique and self-assured debut. It certainly earned the genre tag—silvery guitar figures streaked and twinkled like tiny Explosions in the Sky, while Murphy's keening vocals delivered confrontational and caustic lyrics with spasmodic, burst-and-bloom dynamics. To paraphrase the slow-motion self-evisceration of ""Rory"" (think the Wrens' ""This Is Not What You Had Planned"" stretched to four minutes), he ripped his heart out while it was still beating and shoved it directly in your face. But Foxing are more interested in a renaissance than a ""revival"", and they mirror the adaptive and forward-thinking qualities of their scene, creating a new voice for familiar sentiments: There was certainly hints of Cap'n Jazz on Albatross, but also actual jazz, as well as Sufjan Stevens' baroque Americana and touches of avant-garde R&B.The Albatross darted fitfully and stretched out in all directions, while Dealer pulls all of Foxing's influences inward. Inverting his typical role of making burly post-rock bands sound delicate, producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Caspian) boosts Foxing's fragility—Dealer is constructed like an expensive timepiece where you can see every exacting movement behind a thick, glossy lacquer. Murphy's much-improved vocals negotiate the curvature of ""Weave""'s mournful melody and the band's syncopated sway—imagine what the Chicago late-'90s post-rock scene could've accomplished if they hooked up with the guys downstate in Urbana-Champaign. While there were short instrumental interludes on The Albatross, ""Winding Cloth"" is a full-on string orchestration, offering four minutes to absorb the shellshocked war reportage of ""Indica"" before segueing into the heavy-hearted poetry of ""Redwoods""."

Today, we revisit a slice of hyperactive, politicized nu-metal from 2001.","Toxicity came out one week before September 11th, 2001. Its lead single, “Chop Suey!,” famously landed on a Clear Channel blacklist of songs to avoid broadcasting in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center. “Chop Suey!” contained the word “suicide,” so it joined Dave Matthews Band’s “Crash Into Me” and Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” on a roster of tracks that might conceivably remind listeners of the recent national trauma.“Chop Suey!” became a hit all the same, a nu-metal chimera that crashed unintelligible babbling into the chorus’s gorgeous vocal melody. One minute Serj Tankian’s shucking syllables like pistachio shells, saying nothing; the next he’s appealing to the Lord God Himself in a rich, reverent baritone, singing the words Jesus spoke to his father on the cross: “Why have you forsaken me?” The bait-and-switch between abrasion and allure makes the song irresistible, a songwriting tactic that would elevate System of a Down from the glut of hard rock that occupied a sizable portion of pop radio through the turn of the millennium.Raised in Los Angeles’s Armenian-American community, all four members of System of a Down were primed to see through the myth of American exceptionalism that would justify the coming warmongering of George W. Bush’s presidency. Their families had survived the Armenian genocide under the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century; they grew up in the United States with ancestral scars from a massacre still officially denied by its perpetrators, which lent them keen eyes for political suppression and internal propaganda. It’s as if their position as ethnic outsiders in one of the largest cities in the U.S. contributed to the atypical configuration of their sound.System of a Down released their debut self-titled album toward the end of Rage Against the Machine’s tenure as rock radio’s crowning political agitators. Like RATM, SOAD interpolated West Coast hip-hop’s quick vocal clip into a guitar-driven metal milieu. But SOAD’s compositions disoriented as much as they elucidated. Tankian’s wild, flexible delivery spun out of control. Guitarist Daron Malakian didn’t drive home the beat of their songs so much as he threw it into disarray. Malakian and Tankian forged a close chemistry on the band’s 1998 self-titled debut, whose cover image of an open hand referred to a World War II anti-fascist poster designed by a member of the Communist Party of Germany.Tankien, Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan played with the weight of metal, but the quick pivots of their compositions also aligned them with L.A.’s hardcore punk heritage. Political without dipping into preachiness, they accumulated fans who could either tap into the radical messages of their music or easily ignore them. Come to it with political anguish and you’ll find an outlet for that pain. Come to it with more specific personal angst and you’ll leave just as satisfied."

I see you, Master of Puppets people, but I’ve strapped on the blindfold of Lady Justice and let the scales tip where they may: Justice wins. The songwriting of singer James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich is their most complex and vicious, retaining the power of their early thrash while jettisoning its simplistic schoolyard chants and avoiding the less-compelling hard rock tendencies to come. Use, abuse, experience, and enough beer and Jägermeister to make Keith Moon drive a luxury car into a swimming pool had tempered Hetfield’s reedy yell into something fuller and more forceful, with none of his later cigar-chomping bluster. The lyrics are a ground-level portrait of bureaucratic order pushing down on people too powerless to fight back. And the sound is nearly industrial in its ear-killing intensity, a piece of serrated steel designed to carve you and leave its nihilism in the wounds. Oh, and maybe you’ve heard this: You can’t hear the bass.In celebration of its 30th anniversary, Justice has been remastered and re-released in a variety of formats—from a three-disc reissue with bonus material to a six-LP, four-DVD, 11-CD monstrosity that features a hardcover book of photos and liner notes and is stuffed with enough prints, patches, and assorted swag to fill a Christmas stocking. Three decades later, Justice arguably stands as the only Metallica album that’s as beloved as it is controversial. (The rest tend to skew one way or the other.) After the death of original bassist Cliff Burton in a 1986 bus accident, the band hired Jason Newsted as his replacement. They toured with him, recorded a covers EP with him, gave him moments in the spotlight on stage, and... absolutely buried him in the mix of Justice, his first-full length with Metallica. The result is the most abrasive-sounding album to sell over eight million copies ever. It’s as if, instead of adding canned crowd noises or fake room tone, Metallica preloaded it with tinnitus.Newsted’s absence from the final mix is easy to explain, if not excuse. Some of the factors are innocuous: The three original members and the newcomer were not yet accustomed to each other’s playing styles, which led Newsted to track his basslines mostly to Hetfield’s rhythm guitar. Hetfield himself aimed for a low, pulverizing sound, eating up much of the range Newsted’s bass might have occupied. But reading the accounts of various producers, mixers, and engineers included in this set’s extensive notes suggests a more direct, less savory explanation: The bass isn’t there because the band, namely Ulrich and Hetfield, didn’t want it there."

It’s the pinnacle of goth populism.","Who the fuck is that guy with the ZZ Top beard, Glenn Danzig pondered, and what’s he doing going crazy backstage at MY show? It was a sweltering night in July of 1986 in lower Manhattan, and Danzig had just stormed the stage of the Ritz with his beloved goth rock band Samhain. (The show was part of industry conference New Music Seminar.) You’d think the pasty-faced prince of darkness would be in higher spirits, happy to soak up all of Samhain’s hard-won praises, just as he’d done with earsplitting horror-punk progenitors Misfits earlier in the decade. Instead, lurking backstage just three years after launching his supposedly definitive project, the erstwhile horror punk found himself feeling restless and insatiable.That’s when Danzig got around to talking with the mysterious beardo he spotted backstage earlier in the night. This much-hyped rap producer and label owner was one Rick Rubin. He’d come to the Ritz in search of talent for his Def American label; at the previous year’s conference, he’d discovered his inaugural signees, Slayer. He saw immense potential in Danzig and offered to sign him—provided the frontman cleaned house. “I don’t want any of these old guys,” Danzig recalls Rubin telling him. To Rubin’s ears, “[bassist] Eerie [Von Danzig] can’t play; the drummer can’t play.” His interests were pointed: “I never liked the Misfits,” he said. “All I want to do is sign you.”Remarkably, Rubin’s backhanded compliments resonated. Danzig was up for pressing the reset button on Samhain—but only if bassist Eerie remained, and only if Rubin could convince drummer Chuck Biscuits (D.O.A., Black Flag) to sit behind the kit. The producer honored both requests, but insisted Danzig fire guitarist Pete “Damien” Marshall; John Christ eventually took his place. In 1988, Samhain 2.0 staged their triumphant return under a new name—the frontman’s own, so as to avoid royalty lawsuits—and released a self-titled album. Danzig is a thunderous debut that sharpened and streamlined the preceding project’s moody, blues-rock aesthetic without dialing back the darkness. Consider it the pinnacle of goth populism.Danzig’s strength stems from his devilish voice: a deep, coarse, serpentine croon that fills the space from the bottom up, like a deluge of poisoned honey. Rubin rightly establishes the frontman’s vocals as Danzig’s true north, alongside pared-down arrangements that treat guitar riffs like samples. It makes Danzig’s primal energy all the more fearsome by contrast. Consider the wailing lick Christ doles out on the chorus to “Soul on Fire,” just after Danzig vows revenge on a cold-hearted “devil girl”—it’s not so much a performance as it is an aural exclamation point, a clever instrumental extension of the frontman’s not-so-subtle gravitas."

The Black Album’s dark, muscular sound would permanently alter the course of heavy music.","June 29, 1990: Deep in the guts of Toronto’s CNE Stadium, four shaggy, sweaty, booze-swilling horsemen of the apocalypse are hatching a cultural coup. James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich, and Jason Newsted just opened up for Aerosmith, their childhood heroes. Judging by the muffled roars emanating from the arena, Steven Tyler’s got the world wrapped around his finger. The same will be said for Metallica within a year’s time. They won’t settle for anything less than a supervillain death grip.Granted, Metallica’s approach up to this point has proven hugely successful, a byzantine war machine powered by a spartan tactic Ulrich will later outline to critic David Masciotra as simply: “not fucking up.” Judging from their generous album sales, sold-out tours, Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental Grammy nomination, and hard-won laurels despite crickets from the establishment, “not fucking up” should ensure that their wallets remain as stuffed as the arenas.But these are the guys who gave us Kill ’Em All; they won’t stop until they’ve slayed Poison, Mötley Crüe, Ratt, and every last one of those platinum-blonde, spandex-wearing false heirs to the heavy metal throne with their own weapons: massive riffs, clean vocals, sharp arrangements, and layered mixes that gush from the speakers like knife wounds. They’ll even tap Bob Rock—the man behind Bon Jovi’s Slippery When Wet, an anti-Metallica album if there ever was one—to ensure the heist goes off without a hitch.Naturally, Metallica will name this declaration of war and independence after themselves. It’s the best-selling album of the past 25 years, with currently over 20 million copies sold worldwide, more than Bruce Springsteen’s Born In The U.S.A. or Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon. Even if you handed out three Black Albums to every citizen in Ulrich’s native Denmark, you’d be left with a warehouse full of CDs. Few bands have achieved such ubiquity so that if you know literally one thing about metal music, it is the six-note opening riff to “Enter Sandman.”Though Metallica were neither unknowns nor underdogs when they recorded their fifth studio album Metallica, the status quo as dictated by music critics, disc jockeys, and MTV framed them as such. Throughout the ’80s, Metallica and their Big Four peers—Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax—challenged metal’s emergent portrait of pomp by way of extreme fundamentalism. In her 1992 book Heavy Metal: A Cultural Sociology, Deena Weinstein compared thrash metal to the Protestant Reformation, framing it as a reaction to corruption: “Both movements [the Reformation and thrash metal],” she wrote, “charged that the established form had become corrupt through extravagance, and both supported a return to the essential message, stripped bare of all adornment.”"

These reviews have been less critique than loquacious concept reviews by an entertaining tramp. So you'd think an 80-minute opus by Tool would be right up our alley. You'd be wrong.Undertow, Tool's 1993 debut LP, took studio skill and over-trained chops to metal with aplomb. It was Rush Sabbath. As emotional, melodic metal goes (the cultural impact of which will be left to the reader), it opened doors for bands like the Deftones, and to some degree, Limp Bizkit. However, Tool have always possessed a latent understanding of absurdity and comedy; their videos look like Tim Burton stop-motion, goth Primus.But with popularity and praise, Tool's shadowy tongue-in-cheek turned into the simple biting of tongues. \xC6nema spiced their sound with electronics and industry, as was the trend at the time. Now, with the early new century demanding ""opuses,"" Tool follows suit. The problem is, Tool defines ""opus"" as taking their ""defining element"" (wanking sludge) and stretching it out to the maximum digital capacity of a compact disc.Dictionary of the Underworld also offers several definitions for ""tool,"" including: ""a small boy used to creep through windows,"" ""to steal from women's pockets,"" and ""to loaf, to idle, to do nothing in particular.""

Initially, I thought that perfect music appeared every 16 years, which is also the number of years between Fubert generations. My dad was born in 1971. In that year, landmark albums were released. They were Nursery Crime by Genesis (the first with Phil Collins), Yes Album by Yes, Aqualung by Jethro Tull, and In the Land of Grey and Pink by Caravan.My grandfather skipped out on Vietnam-- because Jimi Hendrix himself told him to-- and he moved to Canterbury, which is in the United England. There, he got married to my grandmother, who used to sell baked goods to people at concerts, and they had my dad. After the war, they moved back with a box of awesome records like the ones I mentioned. I think it was cosmic or fate or something that my dad was born the same exact day Chrysalis released Aqualung, in March of 1971."

Today, we revisit the timeless 1992 debut from Dr. Dre, a historic moment in hip-hop that redefined West Coast rap.","Dr. Dre’s solo rap career began like a yarn out of a mob epic: coercion, conspiracy, guns strategically placed near jacuzzis. As a member of N.W.A in the mid-1980s, the producer was a star, but he was convinced that Eazy-E—the head of his record label, Ruthless, and fellow N.W.A. member—was fleecing him. Dre was seeking freedom from the World’s Most Dangerous Group, but he ended up dealing with someone far more treacherous.Pro football prospect turned hulking enforcer, Marion Knight, Jr., nicknamed Suge for the sweet sugar bear he was as a child, had a reputation for intimidation that was the stuff of industry myth: punching a guy through a closed door and dangling Vanilla Ice off a balcony. He’d been hanging around Ruthless as the D.O.C.’s bodyguard and had grown close to Dre during his conflict with the label. With an eye on becoming a music mogul, Suge saw Dre as his meal ticket. Dre was already done mastering the final N.W.A. album, 1991’s Niggaz4Life, and he wanted out so he could finish work on his solo material. All that was standing in his and Suge’s way was Eazy.On April 23, 1991, Eazy-E went up to the studios at Solar Records where he was greeted by Suge and a small entourage of men with pipes and Louisville sluggers. Suge delivered contract releases for several Ruthless artists and planned to squeeze Eazy into signing them so he could poach the artists for the fledgling label he was starting. He told Eazy he had N.W.A.’s manager Jerry Heller tied up in a van before offering a final warning: “We know where your mother lives.” With that, Eazy signed. The documents weren’t deemed legally binding, but the wheels were in motion. Eventually, Suge got his way: Dre was no longer a Ruthless artist, and Death Row Records was born.In 1992, Dr. Dre was the biggest producer in hip-hop music, a pioneer drawing comparisons to Quincy Jones and Phil Spector; he was also its most unemployable one. Plagued by legal battles and beset with a number of open court cases, nobody would touch him. Five of the eight albums Dre produced for Ruthless from 1987 to 1991 went platinum, but he was a volatile figure prone to violence. He was accused of a savage, public assault by journalist Dee Barnes and another assault on a police officer during a 50-person brawl he allegedly started. On top of that, neither he nor Suge had much of a business acumen, and they were hemorrhaging cash."

The song is a blast of righteous rage, Bob Marley's youngest son unleashing a towering, bulletproof torrent of abuse at the inequalities in his home country of Jamaica, singing about tourists ""on the beach with a few club sodas"" while kids kill each other a few miles away, all over a skeletal track of chest-slamming digital drums and synthetic skank. Songs like that don't come along often, so it's not a knock on Welcome to Jamrock to say it never approaches the power of its title cut.It would've made sense for Marley to attempt to recreate the song's blazing old-school one-drop roots fury throughout the album, but he opts instead to veer all over the musical map with about half the album barely sounding like reggae. The album's opener, ""Confrontation"", finds Marley in full-on prophet mode, singing, ""Any day, revolution might erupt/ And the skies over Kingston lighten up."" It seems like a fitting sequel to ""Jamrock"", except that it trades in that song's rootsy skank for synthetic martial drums and ominous, sawing soundtrack strings. Other tracks draw on the slick breakbeats and sampled funk-guitar stabs of late-80s new jack swing; it's not much of a surprise when Bobby Brown turns up halfway through the album. The expert sex jam ""All Night"" has a rolling throwback beat that could've come from Marley Marl in his prime. A handful of other songs are simply straight-up dancehall, weird coming from the guy who is supposedly at the forefront of reggae's move away from ragga; ""Hey Girl"" even sounds something like a laid-back take on T.O.K. (This is a good thing.)Refreshingly, Marley sounds very little like his father. He's got a strained, abrasive voice with very little in common with Bob's honeyed coo, and his Jamaican accent is so deep and thick that it's often hard for American ears to tell what he's saying. On ""Beautiful"", he namechecks his father alongside the smooth dancehall loverman Super Cat, and in his lighter moments, Marley sounds strikingly like the latter. But on the sad, gorgeous Nas duet ""Road to Zion"", his voice is a weary, lonely sigh reminiscent of Horace Andy. Marley only recalls his father once on ""We're Gonna Make It"", a lush, burbling, melodic old-school reggae track, a style that Marley simply can't do anywhere near as well as his father. Much more powerful is ""Move!"", a song that samples his father's ""Exodus"", adding rushing drums and quick-tongue chatting that become increasingly passionate and frantic as the song progresses. When the drums drop out and Bob's voice comes in on the chorus, it's breathtaking.But despite all its great moments, Jamrock doesn't hold together as an album; its constant stylistic switch-ups keep it from ever building into a whole. The missteps on the album are especially glaring. The Bobby Brown collaboration ""Beautiful"" is ruined by a cheesed-out smooth-jazz session-musician saxophone, while ""Pimpa's Paradise"" enlists the Roots' Black Thought for a boring, condescending woman-gone-astray lament. ""For the Babies"" is a pretty-enough ballad with an orientalist synth riff, but its lyrics are some pro-life bullshit that Pat Robertson would probably approve. And then there's the title track, a song so great that it dwarfs the rest of the album. Marley will be lucky if he ever equals it."

Doo-wop harmonies and the flushed distortion of voices singing their pain were cast over taut snares and hard boom-baps. The lo-fi production and warm, thickly muzzled bass tones purposefully recalled vintage vinyl on a rainy Sunday afternoon. After having written for Whitney Houston, having traveled to Detroit to sit with Aretha, it makes sense that Lauryn Hill returned to look upon the Fugees and their hard, brick-city, midnight-winter rap with a newfound skepticism.Ms. Hill’s background (and perhaps her most developed skill set) lay in hip-hop, and Miseducation had the effect of putting the entire genre on blast. The mid-’90s had seen the ascendency of the genre to corporate-level sales numbers, aided in large part Bad Boy Entertainment, their bromidic disco samples and unrepentant tales of jewelry and gunplay, their rallying cry of “tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars.” Meanwhile, regional acts like N.W.A. and Geto Boys had introduced an incidental violence so extreme that it mutated into horrorcore, and even reigning king Nas, once known as the sharpest and most conscious of project prophets, had ridiculously rebranded himself “Esco” and was spinning elaborate drug tales in juvenile heist raps. The Fugees entered into this mayhem first to settle the score. But it was Lauryn Hill who came to re-educate the whole people.Soul and hip-hop aside, Miseducation is most deeply fueled, spiritually and musically, by reggae. Six years before, the release of the immensely popular Songs of Freedom boxed set pushed the Marley legacy once again forefront of urban youth culture. By 1998, every halfway-conscious hip-hop head knew at least the basics of Marley’s primary theology: That Black people had been subject to centuries oppression at the hands of the un-righteous, but that God was on the side of the oppressed. This meant that you were to live in peace and love with all things, for this is part of your covenant with God, but you were also not to take no bullshit from no oppressor lying down."

Today, we revisit the timeless 1992 debut from Dr. Dre, a historic moment in hip-hop that redefined West Coast rap.","Dr. Dre’s solo rap career began like a yarn out of a mob epic: coercion, conspiracy, guns strategically placed near jacuzzis. As a member of N.W.A in the mid-1980s, the producer was a star, but he was convinced that Eazy-E—the head of his record label, Ruthless, and fellow N.W.A. member—was fleecing him. Dre was seeking freedom from the World’s Most Dangerous Group, but he ended up dealing with someone far more treacherous.Pro football prospect turned hulking enforcer, Marion Knight, Jr., nicknamed Suge for the sweet sugar bear he was as a child, had a reputation for intimidation that was the stuff of industry myth: punching a guy through a closed door and dangling Vanilla Ice off a balcony. He’d been hanging around Ruthless as the D.O.C.’s bodyguard and had grown close to Dre during his conflict with the label. With an eye on becoming a music mogul, Suge saw Dre as his meal ticket. Dre was already done mastering the final N.W.A. album, 1991’s Niggaz4Life, and he wanted out so he could finish work on his solo material. All that was standing in his and Suge’s way was Eazy.On April 23, 1991, Eazy-E went up to the studios at Solar Records where he was greeted by Suge and a small entourage of men with pipes and Louisville sluggers. Suge delivered contract releases for several Ruthless artists and planned to squeeze Eazy into signing them so he could poach the artists for the fledgling label he was starting. He told Eazy he had N.W.A.’s manager Jerry Heller tied up in a van before offering a final warning: “We know where your mother lives.” With that, Eazy signed. The documents weren’t deemed legally binding, but the wheels were in motion. Eventually, Suge got his way: Dre was no longer a Ruthless artist, and Death Row Records was born.In 1992, Dr. Dre was the biggest producer in hip-hop music, a pioneer drawing comparisons to Quincy Jones and Phil Spector; he was also its most unemployable one. Plagued by legal battles and beset with a number of open court cases, nobody would touch him. Five of the eight albums Dre produced for Ruthless from 1987 to 1991 went platinum, but he was a volatile figure prone to violence. He was accused of a savage, public assault by journalist Dee Barnes and another assault on a police officer during a 50-person brawl he allegedly started. On top of that, neither he nor Suge had much of a business acumen, and they were hemorrhaging cash."

Every song was written on 12-string or 6-string acoustic guitars. Petty told The Boston Globe in 1989: “I wanted to experiment with the art of rhythm guitar. Jeff and I feel that acoustic guitars can be rock’n’roll instruments, not just folk instruments.”"

Its personal psychology, meticulous compositions, and world-sized choruses evoked the loss of control in an overwhelming era.","Welcome to your life. From the moment you enter the world, you’re traumatized, first by your very birth, then by every subsequent moment of your existence, each of which will have a profound and significant effect on your behavior; in childhood, when you experience emotional distress, that pain remains, buried underneath time and memory.In 1970, the psychologist Arthur Janov published The Primal Scream, in which he detailed his theory that the neuroses and baggage that adults carry with them are caused by repressed traumatic events from childhood. The same year, John Lennon and Yoko Ono underwent therapy sessions with Janov for about five months. Lennon channeled his experiences into his solo debut, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. He created one album out of his encounters with Janov; Tears for Fears based their entire career off of Janov’s work.Even the band’s name is derived from The Primal Scream, on a theory of children’s nightmares. “Basically, if they are allowed to be themselves in their waking hours and are allowed to let their natural crying out, then they won’t dream up monsters at night to be scared of because they can’t face the reality of being scared of their parents,” bassist and co-singer Curt Smith told Will Hall, the author of Tears for Fears . . . Tales From the Big Chair. “Since emotional stress is the central issue here, the solution... is to encourage an emotional response so intense that the years of hidden anger and hurt are allowed to surface from the depths of the unconscious.”On their second LP, 1985’s Songs From the Big Chair, Tears for Fears took a cue from Lennon and applied what they’d learned from Janov toward studies of single subjects: money, power, love, war, faith. But where Lennon went small, Tears for Fears went huge. They took the goth and synth-pop foundation they constructed on their debut, 1983’s The Hurting, and piled on saxophone, Fairlights, guitar solos, samplers, and live drums on top of drum machines. They wrote cresting choruses, arena-ready anthems, elegant ballads, and multi-section songs that have more in common with prog-rock than most of new wave. And they improbably created not just one of the biggest albums of the 1980s, but an album that manages to exude the 1980s in the same way that Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours conveys the lonely narcissism and hedonism of the ’70s, or Love’s Forever Changes captures both the bliss and the ominousness of the Summer of Love."

Today we revisit a 1980s rock blockbuster: the bold, brilliant, and misunderstood apex of Bruce Springsteen’s imperial era.","As the release of Born in the U.S.A. approached in spring 1984—and with it, one of the greatest commercial ascents in the history of popular music—Bruce Springsteen was feeling apprehensive. It wasn’t because of “Dancing in the Dark,” which he added last-minute after his manager convinced him to write one more surefire attempt at a hit. It wasn’t because of the title track, a booming anthem whose chorus could be misinterpreted as a rallying cry for Reagan-era jingoism. And it wasn’t because of the cover art, a photograph by Annie Leibovitz that could be mistaken for a man urinating on an American flag. It was because of a song called “No Surrender,” and, in particular, its final verse:Now on the street tonight the lights grow dimThe walls of my room are closing inThere’s a war outside still ragingYou say it ain’t ours anymore to winI want to sleep beneath peaceful skies in my lover’s bedWith a wide open country in my eyesAnd these romantic dreams in my headSomething felt off as he sang these words. Who could be so blindly optimistic? During the tour for Born in the U.S.A., which spanned 16 months and brought the E Street Band to the biggest audiences they had ever played, Springsteen tried retooling the driving arrangement as a tender acoustic ballad; he rewrote the verse and changed his delivery. By the end of the run, it only appeared sporadically in setlists. “It was a song I was uncomfortable with,” he wrote years later. “You don’t hold out and triumph all the time in life. You compromise, you suffer defeat; you slip into life’s gray areas.”So how did it wind up on the album? It wasn’t for a lack of material. Most casual fans know that as Springsteen was in the process of piecing together this full-band masterpiece, he first recorded an entirely different one: 1982’s solo acoustic Nebraska, originally intended as demos for the follow-up to 1980’s The River. But there was more where that came from. Before he landed on the dozen songs that would comprise his bestselling album, Springsteen continued down Nebraska’s folky path with story-song outtakes like “Shut Out the Light”; he worked with the band on epics like “This Hard Land” and straight-ahead rockers like “Murder Incorporated.” He wrote a goofy song about having his story told in a TV movie and a strange, apocalyptic one about the KKK. He is estimated to have recorded somewhere between 50 and 100 songs, hoping to amass enough material for one cohesive record."

Their new Crimes of Passion is brasher, nervier, and a lot more fun than previous efforts.","From their Echo and the Bunnymen-inspired moniker to their Automatic-for-the-people appropriation, Crocodiles are so studious in retracing the moves of their stoned 'n' dethroned 80s post-punk forbears that their most intriguing moments come when they aimlessly start drawing outside the lines. Note how ""Hung Up on a Flower"", the otherwise dirgey balladic centerpiece of last year's Endless Flowers, degenerates into two minutes of a woman nattering on in German, her voice echoing out in mutated shapes atop a bed of grimy guitar fuzz. The dying moments of ""I Like It in the Dark"" -- the opening track from Crocodiles' fourth LP, Crimes of Passion -- yield something equally nonsensical yet startling: The song's joyous gospel-delic groove fades out, but singer Brandon Welchez isn't quite finished talking yet, as he lets loose with an extended, a capella stream of beat-poet babble that was seemingly being drowned out all along by the boisterous song preceding it, like a dubbed-over cassette that didn't fully erase its previous contents.No other moment on Crimes of Passion approaches the same degree of wanton absurdity. But where that random Deutsch-laden rant on ""Hung Up on a Flower"" stood into stark contrast to Endless Flowers' student-disco formalism, Crimes of Passion's off-kilter intro serves as a harbinger of the album's guileless, unguarded spirit, as producer Sune Rose Wagner successfully coaxes the band to drop their Ray Bans and reveal the puppy-dog eyes welling up underneath. Sonically, Crocodiles are still very much the sort of band scientifically engineered to appease the small minority who believe the Jesus and Mary Chain's second-best album is Munki (not that there's anything wrong with that); Welchez lets his suggestive lyrics ooze out of his mouth like he was a third Reid brother, and whenever the band deviate from their trusty fuzz-pop playbook, it's in precisely the same ways U.K.-indie idols like Primal Scream and Spiritualized once did, whether deploying roadhouse horns, gospel-diva vocal wails, and steeple-shaking piano rolls as signifiers of Southern-soul authenticity or sci-fi synths to exude some Teutonic futurism. However, thanks to Rose Wagner's punchy production and emphasis on economy, Crimes of Passion-- unlike the band's previous records-- doesn't require the accompaniment of strobe lights and dry ice to fully connect. The new record basks in Endless Flowers' sunny afterglow*,* but the songs here are brasher, nervier, and a lot more fun.Even at its most slavishly Mary Chained-- ""Cockroach"" practically comes outfitted with its own pompadoured Afro-- Crimes of Passion evinces a fidgety, tambourine-rattled exuberance that lends the record a brisk momentum, meaning a band that once routinely droned on past the five-minute mark can now get the job done in three. But the album is most distinguished by its starry-eyed ballads, like the Las-esque jangle-pop standout ""She Splits Me Up"" or the Jean Genet-copping moonlit lullaby ""Un Chant D'amour"". And while it may be a stretch to call the retro-gear fetishism of ""Teardrop Guitar"" a love song, its ecstatic verve makes for as solid a sequel to ""She Bangs the Drum"" as the reunited Stone Roses could come up in 2013 if they tried. Such open-hearted gestures may not be enough to fully redirect Crocodiles away from the nihilism-by-numbers of ""Me and My Machine Gun"" and ""Gimme Some Annihilation"", but they offer encouraging evidence that the band is becoming more adept at not just projecting the aloof attitude of their Brit-rock influences, but their flair for disarming, emotionally resonant songcraft. At this point in the game, we've grown accustomed to seeing Crocodiles flash their teeth; it's much more interesting to see them shed their skin."

It’s the pinnacle of goth populism.","Who the fuck is that guy with the ZZ Top beard, Glenn Danzig pondered, and what’s he doing going crazy backstage at MY show? It was a sweltering night in July of 1986 in lower Manhattan, and Danzig had just stormed the stage of the Ritz with his beloved goth rock band Samhain. (The show was part of industry conference New Music Seminar.) You’d think the pasty-faced prince of darkness would be in higher spirits, happy to soak up all of Samhain’s hard-won praises, just as he’d done with earsplitting horror-punk progenitors Misfits earlier in the decade. Instead, lurking backstage just three years after launching his supposedly definitive project, the erstwhile horror punk found himself feeling restless and insatiable.That’s when Danzig got around to talking with the mysterious beardo he spotted backstage earlier in the night. This much-hyped rap producer and label owner was one Rick Rubin. He’d come to the Ritz in search of talent for his Def American label; at the previous year’s conference, he’d discovered his inaugural signees, Slayer. He saw immense potential in Danzig and offered to sign him—provided the frontman cleaned house. “I don’t want any of these old guys,” Danzig recalls Rubin telling him. To Rubin’s ears, “[bassist] Eerie [Von Danzig] can’t play; the drummer can’t play.” His interests were pointed: “I never liked the Misfits,” he said. “All I want to do is sign you.”Remarkably, Rubin’s backhanded compliments resonated. Danzig was up for pressing the reset button on Samhain—but only if bassist Eerie remained, and only if Rubin could convince drummer Chuck Biscuits (D.O.A., Black Flag) to sit behind the kit. The producer honored both requests, but insisted Danzig fire guitarist Pete “Damien” Marshall; John Christ eventually took his place. In 1988, Samhain 2.0 staged their triumphant return under a new name—the frontman’s own, so as to avoid royalty lawsuits—and released a self-titled album. Danzig is a thunderous debut that sharpened and streamlined the preceding project’s moody, blues-rock aesthetic without dialing back the darkness. Consider it the pinnacle of goth populism.Danzig’s strength stems from his devilish voice: a deep, coarse, serpentine croon that fills the space from the bottom up, like a deluge of poisoned honey. Rubin rightly establishes the frontman’s vocals as Danzig’s true north, alongside pared-down arrangements that treat guitar riffs like samples. It makes Danzig’s primal energy all the more fearsome by contrast. Consider the wailing lick Christ doles out on the chorus to “Soul on Fire,” just after Danzig vows revenge on a cold-hearted “devil girl”—it’s not so much a performance as it is an aural exclamation point, a clever instrumental extension of the frontman’s not-so-subtle gravitas."

On Hysteria, the Australian folk singer-songwriter opens up her world, a change that’s also reflected in personnel. Where Echo, with its goosebump vocals and fingers brushing guitar strings, was produced with Big Thief’s Adrianne Lenker, Hysteria is the result of a collaboration with Aaron Dessner, the National multi-instrumentalist who has also worked with Taylor Swift. With support from Dessner, Sparke sings defiantly over full-bodied instrumentation. But the newfound spaciousness isn’t only expressed in the music: her songwriting, too, stretches further, running as far as the eye can see.Sparke wrote the majority of this album during the early months of 2020, when she was struggling under the weight of a collapsing relationship at the same time that society seemed to be falling apart, too. “The grief opened a doorway to the past I thought I had made peace with,” she explained in a press release. “But there were days where I just couldn’t get off the floor. It felt like everything was falling through this hole in my chest.” The emotions of Hysteria are elemental forces: a red moon sinking (“Time Gets Eaten”) or a cypress tree growing from your abdomen (“Infinity Honey”). They refuse to stay put inside the individual body: Instead, they reach outward through generations, society, and the earth itself.The album is bracketed by two of its best songs, which both use a sweeping, montage-style approach to storytelling. On the opening “Blue,” the layering of Sparke’s vocal creates a forlorn and restless choir, as she repeats the same melodic motif over insistent, driving guitar strums. The song moves relentlessly while Sparke offers glimpses at emergency after emergency: domestic abuse, relationship breakdowns, desperate phone calls in the dead of night. The details are spare yet searing; it’s both a deeply personal catharsis and something seen distantly. “Burn,” the closing track, sways loosely, Sparke’s voice gliding over jangling acoustic chords as she delves into cobwebbed childhood nightmares and the long shadow of familial trauma. The lineage Sparke evokes in these songs is a specifically female-coded one: Hysteria, after all, takes its root from the Greek “hystera,” meaning “uterus,” and it’s a word loaded with patriarchal history. Sparke reclaims it on this album, using imagery of tides, moons, and wombs to depict heavy emotions with solemnity.Hysteria showcases Sparke’s ability to glide between minimalism and more forceful storms. While the surface of this album is glossier and broader than its predecessor, the most stunning moments are still ones of hushed reverence: “Real” is an earthy ballad with Sparke singing alone over fingerpicking as she evokes a feeling of ghostly hunger. This quiet moment feels more poignant placed near the rousing, ember-stoking drama of “Set Your Fire on Me.” On the lustrous highlight “God Is a Woman’s Name,” Sparke blends both extremes of her sound, with soft blush verses and strident choruses that focus on her pleading ritualistic chant: “Pray, pray, pray.”At 14 tracks, Hysteria is a longer album than Echo, and it doesn’t always maintain its intensity. The push and pull between ballads and bolder songs sometimes sacrifices the momentum. But the wider lens, which allows Sparke to dial up both her indie-rock sound and sweeping songwriting, is still impressive. During the bluesy swoon of “Time Gets Eaten,” she shines in her upper register, half-rhyming “love is a lie” with “love is still alive,” leaving an unresolved tension between the two as she sighs, “Love is.” It’s as though the song is a Rorschach test, checking how hopeful you’re feeling that day. Despite the darkly personal themes, Sparke’s sprawling horizons always create space for you inside.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

On his second album Hysteria, produced by Royal Trux's Neil Michael Hagerty, everything emerges in semi-slow motion.","The music of now-defunct Canadian trio AIDS Wolf was as bold and confrontational as their name. It was a blare of frenetic energy and rhythmic bludgeoning. Beneath all the prog-punk brutality lurked actual song structures, the kind that could easily hypnotize anyone with the patience to uncover them. But no matter how long you stuck with them, AIDS Wolf always managed to incite dizziness through chaos.In his solo project Drainolith, AIDS Wolf guitarist Alexander Moskos has a similar goal, but comes at it from an opposite side. Where his former band built an in-your-face wall, Moskos’ sound is all skeleton. The moving parts and overlapping shapes that motor his songs are in clear view. He’s not afraid to get dense and noisy too, but you can always hear a Drainolith tune being built, each element working to find its place. Beats fall down and get back up; shards of guitar riffs build into loops; somnambulant moans glide by, then dive into the music’s crevices.On Hysteria, the follow-up to Drainolith’s 2012 debut Fighting!, everything emerges in semi-slow motion. It’s as if there's a faster, tighter version of these songs out there somewhere that Moskos could catch up to if he felt like it. But he’s more interested in wrestling the ghosts of those imagined tunes than inhabiting their bodies. The effect is disorienting but intoxicating—music designed to sneak up rather than overwhelm.Especially mesmerizing is the way Moskos fuses together melodies while simultaneously wrenching them apart. It feels like you should be able to hum along to these songs—and in places you can—but it's all skewed enough to dodge predictability. Moskos grafts together parts that don’t naturally fit in a way that recalls Captain Beefheart’s misshapen anti-songs, but his aura is much woozier, almost lethargic. Yet Hysteria rarely settles into grooves that allow passive listening. Moskos may sound like a stoner, but that's because he wants you to feel foggy and confused rather than comfortable.This smoky haze comes across in Moskos’ words, too. During ""Inside and Outside (Bog’s Blues)"", he sounds like he’s not even sure he’s awake: ""The structure of my sleep/ Is different this time,"" he slurs, practically drooling onto the pillow. In the drifting, beat-less ""Joy Road"", he whispers that ""Sometimes it seems like everything’s/ Moving too damn fast.../ Slow it down/ Move the ground/ Watch it shake."" Moskos’ zombified delivery recalls the sleep-walk of Excepter’s John Fell Ryan. But where that band often sounds like deconstructed disco, Drainolith is more like fractured rock—rock whose muscles have been stretched so much its bones dislodge and rattle against each other.There’s also a hint of broken blues to Hysteria that recalls the more drug-addled side of Royal Trux. That’s not surprising, since Neil Michael Hagerty produced this session, which also resulted in the excellent Dan’l Boone record featuring Hagerty, Moskos, and Wolf Eyes’ Nate Young. But such comparisons just reveal Moskos’ very particular take on rock, an approach that resolutely eschews expected patterns. The result is a kind of blissful cognitive dissonance, making Hysteria’s 25 minutes feel wonderfully longer."

Home to the collective ...","There must be something odd going on in the quiet little town of Weilheim, Germany. Home to the collective of labels known as Hausmusik, Payola and Kollaps, the number of groups from this area south of Munich has multiplied spectacularly in the past decade. To name only a few: The Notwist, Tied and Tickled Trio, Village of Savoonga, Fred is Dead, Couch, Console, and A Million Mercies. Some of these bands are better known than others, but each functions within the often incestuous Weilheim framework. Now we can add Thomas Weber's Kammerflimmer Kollektief (Shimmering Collective) to that list.Begun in the late 90s as an electro-acoustic one-man project incorporating electronic sound constructions into both the rock and jazz idioms, Weber initially released two limited-run 12"" singles for the Weilheim-based Payola label in 1998 (both of which were collected on their debut full-length, Mäander, last year). Approximating the free jazz of the late 60's (John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Peter Brötzmann as reference points) and blending it with traditional rock structures, Kammerflimmer astounded, and marked new territory for the German scene. Tracks like ""Implodiert"" and ""Nachtwach"" were rhythmically explosive; anchored by Weber's bass and working around a slow-building hiss of electronics, they would eventually careen into a climax of ear-splitting dissonance and static. With those releases and subsequent works-- an incredible remix of Tied and Tickled Trio's ""Constant"" and the strictly jazz Incommunicado, which is just seeing U.S. release this month through Temporary Residence-- Weber carved his own niche within the minds of a select few record aficionados around the globe.With this, the Kollektief's third release in a year, the sense of surging immediacy so prevalent on the initial releases has been abandoned in favor of subtlety and suggestive soundscapes. Weber expanded the collective to a six-piece with the jazz workout of Incommunicado, and that lineup sticks around for Hysteria as well. Clocking in at barely over thirty minutes, the newest release plays more like an EP. Reserving three of the six tracks for his solo sonic experiments, Weber plays along with the other members on three group songs. After just one listen, it becomes quickly apparent that Weber functions much better on his own than within the group context.Kammerflimmer begins the album in a haze with the title track. Built around his electronic treatments and the plucked strings of an upright bass, the lead track buzzes with Weber's signature sound-- a high-pitched burst of static noise that weaves in and out of the background. Weber's ability to take inorganic sound treatments and effortlessly blend them with traditional instrumentation has been one of the most captivating elements of the music he produces. At times reminiscent of Scenic's Acquatica, the standout track (""Engel Wacht"") is Weber working solo again. Pulling together the sound of wind chimes, distant percussion, and (surprise!) sudden but effective bursts of static, Weber constructs a beautiful track built around mournful guitar playing."

Tracks on 2004's Neji EP bore titles like ""Pop Group,"" ""This Heat,"" and ""Sonic Youth,"" and for good reason. On guitar, drums, and bass, the trio whipped up a ferocious, muscular racket scarred with pockets of deep silence—a post-punk template shot through with the ghosts of dub and free noise.Over the years, they've moved away from the prickly aggression of their early records and toward a sleeker, more measured form, one equally informed by Krautrock's steady burble and minimal techno's crosshatched textures. It's as if they started out brandishing a misshapen lump of scrap metal and have proceeded to hammer it out into a long, linear shape, perfectly proportioned. And I do mean long: Their tracks routinely run to 10 or 12 or 14 minutes, and they increasingly feel less like individual songs than outtakes of a single continuum. After touring their 2013 album N, they decided that the material's metronomic clatter had evolved enough that it merited a re-recording for a new release, N', in which it's not so much the songs that have changed as the air and the light around them. In its rigor and regularity, all of the trio's work this decade sounds like a tribute to Agnes Martin's grid drawings. It's the tiny variations within their repeated structures where the crucial differences happen, where life dwells. Nisennenmondai might be the world's most disciplined jam band.Their new album, #N/A, proceeds directly from their last two. Its opening track, ""#1,"" might as well be a continuation of N and N''s respective openers, ""A"" and ""A'."" It sounds like a teletype in a hurricane. But they're also stretching out and exploring new territory here. Where ""#1"" and ""#5"" are quickstepping as ever—somewhere near 150 BPM, a tempo that requires gargantuan feats of concentration and muscle control to rein in their tightly interlocking rhythms when they play live—they slow down slightly on ""#2."" At under four minutes long, ""#3"" is both one of the shortest songs they've done in ages and also the one that comes closest to approximating actual techno, with undulating drones that sound uncannily like Richie Hawtin and Steve Bug's ultra-minimal anthem ""Low Blow,"" from 2002.But there is an important shift on the new record: the addition of On-U Sound's Adrian Sherwood, the British producer and dub wizard, whose mixing-desk manipulations blow the trio's sound wide open, from two dimensions into three or four. His addition helps them shift even further from the associations that usually cling to the typical rock-trio lineup—aside from Sayaka Himeno's diamond-tipped hi-hats, nothing here sounds like what it actually is. Masako Takada's guitar swerves between hollow drones and whippoorwilling trills and a porous, soft-hard spray like a sandblaster full of nail clippings. Yuri Zaikawa's bass is either pure rhythm or pure shadow. Together, they all sound like exploding clockworks, and even more so when Sherwood lassoes individual sounds and whips them to and fro.Against the trio's unflinching sense of discipline, he represents something closer to chaos; to their ceaseless repetition he brings unpredictability. In ""#5,"" gunshots ring out, and so does a typewriter bell; it's unclear what those sounds really are, or where they may have come from. Summoned or not, through the magic of dub, they simply appear. Sherwood's manipulations remain relatively restrained on the five studio cuts, but on two live tracks, he really goes to town, twisting delay knobs and reeling off serpentine licks that magnify the aberrations of the trio's straight-ahead groove. There may be no artist more committed to the line as a creative medium than Nisennenmondai; projected through Sherwood's spacetime-distorting lens, their vision of infinity becomes all the more engrossing."

On AM, the quartet, now based in Los Angeles, offer a paranoid, haunted collection that goes beyond the sweaty clubs and furtive flirts into the hotel rooms, after parties, and bad decisions that can follow.","Their first record was called Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not—a Nevermind the Bollocks–type sendup of the generation-defining Self-Titled Debut Album as well as a bratty act of defiance from four Yorkshire youths drunk on their own twitchy cleverness. Their fifth album is called AM, and those mountainous initials stood sky-high behind the band as they preened and stomped like proper rock stars through a headlining Glastonbury set earlier this year. Their face-shrouding hair and brown hoodies are out; greaser streaks and bespoke suits are in. And the same band that once aimed its sights at windbag poseurs on “Fake Tales of San Francisco” is now based in Los Angeles. These changes have caused some to question Arctic Monkeys’ commitment to their initial no-bullshit ideals. But the quartet isn’t giving into the mindless grandeur of rock’n’roll as much as they’re working within its confines to mine new territory; over the last eight years, as they’ve gone from spastic punk, to doomed stoner rock, to sparkling guitar pop, to this new album’s skinny-jeaned funk, Arctic Monkeys have stayed close to the spirit of their debut’s title while minimizing its excess at the same time.Meanwhile, singer and lyricist Alex Turner has moved from syllable-stuffing chronicles of indie nightlife culture to songs that are sleeker, more blue-black, more self-lacerating. Thematically, AM centerpiece “No. 1 Party Anthem” comes off like a seedier take on Arctic Monkeys’ breakout track “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor” as it tells of a collar-popped lothario on the prowl in a dank club made up of “lights on the floors and sweat on the walls, cages and poles.” But instead of blaring, this anthem is wistful, its piano, acoustic strums, and croons suggesting days gone by (along with ’70s Elton John and Rod Stewart). Its swirling bridge sums up the scene in just a few choice phrases—“The look of love/The rush of blood/The ‘she’s with me’/The Gallic shrug”—and sounds like a definitive endnote to Turner’s most notable songwriting style.So AM goes beyond the sweaty clubs and furtive flirts into the hotel rooms, after parties, and bad decisions that can follow. The crux of the record is neatly summed up by the hook to the blistering “R U Mine?”: “R U mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?”—an entire world of sex and love and desire distilled to quick-hit text-speak that Drake could appreciate. Turner isn’t sure of the answer to that question, and the resulting limbo does his head in all over the LP. He’s an avowed romantic living in an unromantic world, grasping for meaning in a city-to-city road-dog lifestyle hellbent on repelling it. In some ways, Turner’s struggle and his band’s recent gleaming transformation into something like rock gods is reminiscent of U2’s turnaround circa Achtung Baby, when that quartet traded in deep virtuousness for sin, rhythm, and leather jackets. For Arctic Monkeys, loosening the tether to credulity can be freeing, allowing the band to live out their classic-rock dreams: T. Rex bop, Bee Gees backup vocals, Rolling Stones R&B, and Black Sabbath monster riffage are all rendered modern throughout AM with the help of longtime producer James Ford. And for Turner in particular, the switch has him connecting strings of desperate 3 a.m. thoughts: some horny, some bleary, some a bit frightening."

It's easy to get on one's soapbox and suppose that people want mediocrity. I mean, how else are we to explain the success of a musical Steve Guttenberg such as M. Ward? One can argue that when it comes to music, the public tends to applaud a certain kind of consistency, with records that sound familiar. But that's of course a false dichotomy. And while none of us would easily deny fame and influence, some artists simply choose the roads less traveled (if I may be allowed to make a high school poetry reference rather than a grad school one).Blau-- who's one-third of supertrio D+ (alongside Bret Lunsford from Beat Happening and the aforementioned Elverum) and who's worked with Mirah, Wolf Colonel, Nate Ashley, the Microphones, and Little Wings-- certainly seems more interested in winding backroads than interstates. The Anacortes, Wash.-based singer-songwriter is kind of like Kevin Ayers with a work ethic. A strong advocate for all-ages venues, his own monthly record service (Kelp!) sends CD-Rs and LPs directly to fans. He may re-record a Microphones album or collect field recordings. His entire shtick might be precious and trite if the work weren't also so straightforward and excellent.Blau's delightful new record is called AM. Actually, it's not that new. Having originally released it in a more stripped-down form as a CD-R via his monthly record service Kelp! in late 2006, Blau started on this album after he finished work on 2006's Beneath Waves. ""As B.W. was a live with band album for the most part, I took some time to record by my lonesome,"" Blau explains via email. The album meanders from anxious and droney tunes such as the hurdy gurdy (or is that melodica?)-plus-guitar feedback opening number ""Morning Prayer"" to laid-back folksy groovers like the drawling last track, ""In the Morning"". The latter song has all of the charm of the least angsty and full-throated songs by Kurt Cobain. Speaking of the 1990s, ""Yellow Sunbonnet"" sounds like the drunken demo version of some forgotten grunge hit, while the playful xylophone on ""Growing Up"" sounds like Skip Spence doing a pop-punk tune backed by second graders.I'm not sure if it qualifies as a concept album, but three of the songs on AM have the word ""morning"" in the title. And then two tunes have the word ""bird"" in the title, which is apparently something one hears if one is to awaken early, the sound of birds. I personally am a late riser, but I love the idea of the morning. So does Blau, who writes that ""AM was written and recorded in the wee hours of the day to reflect beginnings: spring, childhood, morning."" And AM has multiple meanings, too: ""I adopted and adapted several poems-- one paragraph actually from a Winnie the Pooh story-- by A.A. Milne. I was reading his work to my daughter at the time of recording this; it hit me that this was very much in the vein of what I was doing with the music.""Again, this enterprise would be so fucking twee if almost anyone else did it. I hasten to add that it's entirely possible to listen to this without being aware of the song's origins. It's not like there's a cover of Loggins and Messina's ""House at Pooh Corner"" or anything. And musically, it owes no debts to either Belle or Sebastian. Instead, it's a messy experimental folk-pop album of songs recorded in the bedroom before the artist was fully awake. It's awesome."

Kali Uchis),7.49e-06,1.0,6.0,0.371,global,8.5,"On Tyler’s sincere and most accomplished album, he gets to the essence of what he's been chiseling at: the angst of a missed connection, the pain of unrequited love, and navigating youthful ennui.","Tyler, the Creator’s music has often been defined by exclusion. He was furious when rap blogs refused to post Odd Future songs. He has gleefully responded to being banned from countries. His songs attempted to reconcile with a divided fanbase. The subtext of Odd Future was that pearl-clutching moralists simply weren’t in on the (obscene) joke—the whole point of being radicals is to be “apart from.” He has also done his fair share of exclusion, too: marginalizing and upsetting women and queer people with violently misogynistic and homophobic lyrics. It has been asked how to reconcile the genius with the foul-mouthed punk.Flower Boy (promoted as Scum Fuck Flower Boy) is Tyler’s course-correction, surprisingly meditative and beautifully colored, a collage of memories and daydreams that trades bratty subversion for reflection and self-improvement. He probes the things that shaped his psyche—loneliness, isolation, and disorientation—and focuses on outgrowing friendships, balancing the pull of nostalgia and the necessity for growth. Not only is Flower Boy Tyler’s most trenchant work, it’s his most inclusive: “Find Your Wings”: The Album, gentle and liberating. “Tell these black kids they can be who they are,” he raps on “Where This Flower Blooms,” as he grows into the artist he’s always longed to be, and perhaps always was.While trying to recreate an N.E.R.D. album, Cherry Bomb more or less imploded. But it didn't completely shed Tyler’s old skin, enlisting a host of colorful collaborators (Roy Ayers, Leon Ware, Charlie Wilson, Chaz Bundick, and Dâm-Funk) for songs about jerking off and underage relationships. His raps were regularly empty games of juvenile one-upmanship, snooty hand-wringing aimed at homebodies and the working class, and vitriolic rant raps aimed at no one in particular. There were love songs, but they were immature and sometimes flat-out creepy. Time had rendered his shock raps pretty toothless, and it was all sloppy. Conversely, Flower Boy is transformational, lovestruck and penetrating. Finally, Tyler gets to the essence of ideas he’s been chiseling at all along: the angst of a missed connection, the pain of unrequited love, navigating youthful ennui. These are hopeful and sincere songs about finding yourself and trying to find someone who values you completely.Tyler spends much of Flower Boy chasing his “‘95 Leo,” coming out in the process. On “Foreword,” he raps, “Shoutout to the girls that I lead on/For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm/And trying they hardest to keep my head on straight/And keeping me up enough till I had thought I was airborne.” He later writes, “Next line will have ‘em like ‘Whoa’: I’ve been kissing white boys since 2004.” The album’s literal and figurative centerpiece is “Garden Shed,” an inward-looking sexual awakening turning an extended metaphor into a watershed moment. Flower Boy unfurls from this revelation and the subsequent romance. He pens songs for his lover (“See You Again”), leaves him voicemails (“Glitter”), and seeks comfort through contact."

I ...","Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate, satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable, safe, forgettable.I have just summed up in 19 words what I am about to say about Coldplay's debut full-length, Parachutes, in 600. Aside from being seemingly tailor-made for the paper-thin adult contemporary market, what is it about this Britrock quartet that's driving them up the American charts? Is it their popularity in their home country, or their Mercury Music Prize nomination? Could it be their charming, boyish good looks? Perhaps, even, a reputation built by Noel Gallagher's projected insistence that they're ""a bunch of fuckin' pansies, the lot of them?""In reality, Coldplay's secret deadly weapon is vocalist Chris Martin. With the ability to mimic a Brit-accented Dave Matthews one minute, Jeff Buckley revived from the dead the next, and sometimes even a young Peter Gabriel, Martin's heartfelt delivery seems to be what's winning the hearts, wallets and alternative radio request lines of Americans young and old. That's not to say that the rest of the group isn't sharp. Guitarist Jon Buckland provides plaintive, strummed acoustic guitar with the occasional amplified wail, and bassist Guy Berryman with drummer Will Champion form a competent rhythm section.Oh yeah, the songs. They're nothing special. Most of the 10 tracks on Parachutes are indeed pleasant enough, often consisting of standard alterna-pop fare with the occasional folky ballad. They're innocent and inoffensive in general, but in turn, they're also exceedingly generic and immediately forgettable-- so much so, in fact, that after a minute of one song, you've usually already forgotten what the last song sounded like. And that's even after a few listens.Parachutes opens with ""Don't Panic,"" the title of which is likely lifted from British mock sci-fi classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with it. This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of ""We live in a beautiful world,"" which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record; the record also closes with the inspirational swinger ""Everything's Not Lost.""Most of the other songs sort of drift in and out of consciousness, with the exception of the second track, ""Shiver."" It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's ""Grace."" Martin has his Buckley impression down cold, complete with dynamic range and the trademark vibrato. But as enjoyable as the song may be, there's no question that Buckley did it better.And of course, you've probably heard their smash hit single, ""Yellow,"" by now. Indeed, it's the most obvious choice for a single, and it represents Martin's vocal stylings effectively, but it's also the record's weakest moment. Buckland's grating, slightly tuneless guitars seem jarring, especially when sequenced in the middle of a series of songs that generally lack dissonance. And the saccharine lyrics are those that might have caused Mr. Gallagher's hypothetical remark: ""Look at the stars/ Look how they shine for you/ And everything you do."" You'd practically expect the band to show up at your doorstep with a wilting bouquet and Hallmark card.Parachutes is ultimately a promising debut for Coldplay, if by ""promising,"" I mean, ""promising them a windfall of cash and international popularity."" If nothing else, it's harmless and pretty. Unfortunately, it's nothing else. If that's what you look for in your music, by all means, go for it. If you want substance, I suggest moving on."

For example: “Uptown Funk” vocalist and animatronic sequined suit Bruno Mars once sang the words “loungin’ on the couch just chillin’ in my Snuggie.” Every part of it is retroactively bizarre: the idea that Mars, the hardest-working embodiment of the “hardest-working man in showbiz” cliche, once attached himself to something called “The Lazy Song”; that he once aligned himself with flash-in-the-pan acoustic bros like Travie McCoy; or, more broadly, that he used to make pop in the 2010s that sounded like the 2010s. Much has been made of Mars’ childhood stint as an Elvis impersonator, with reason. The same talent that allowed a squeaky 4-year-old to channel, uncannily, the King’s gruff bark and distant whiff of scandal is the talent that allows Mars to inhabit whatever he wants. He’s as convincing a cheeky horndog (early hits with his production group the Smeezingtons include Flo Rida’s cheesy-sleazy hit “Right Round” and Mike Posner’s dubiously conceived “Bow Chicka Wow Wow”) as he is a worshipful loverman (the chaste stretch from “Nothin’ on You” through “Grenade”); he's as eager an omnivorous music fan (the Unorthodox Jukebox era remade Billy Joel and the Police as faithfully as any R&B or funk referents) as the comparatively laser-focused revivalist of 24K Magic.Also improbable: that “Uptown Funk,” still inescapable at weddings and stadiums near you, still has life in it, let alone an album’s worth. The title track to 24K Magic is all but an explicit retread: YSL swapped out for designer minks, Chucks for Inglewood’s finest shoes, corny “dragon wanna retire, man” line for corny line about red getting the blues, “Oops Upside Your Head” biting swapped out for only slightly less lawsuit-prone Zapp voiceover vocoders. What it lacks in a hook it makes up for (almost) with vibe, and more importantly, earnestness.24K Magic, the album, sticks to the same well-trod path. It often comes off as a one-man recreation of Mark Ronson’s similarly retro-fetishist Uptown Special—Ronson himself was tapped early on as a potential collaborator—with one key difference: all roles here are filled by Mars. Aside from a couple guest production jobs by former collaborators Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, the album is largely produced by Shampoo Press & Curl—a mildly reorganized incarnation of the Smeezingtons. And as Mars boasted in pre-album press, there are no features. The idea is that he needs no features. He’s become practically all things to all people—he has enough session-wonk credibility to appeal to the Grammy-voting industry types who’ve adopted Mars as a standard-bearer for Real Musicianship; he has enough pop and R&B cred to keep the radio listeners around; enough showmanship to pull off a Super Bowl halftime performance while barely into his career; enough wedding-reception goofiness to ingratiate himself to anyone left over."

YHLQMDLG, released in March, flirted with the top of the pops and dominated the Latin charts; he’s graced awards-show stages and the covers of Western media’s storied publications; he’s evolved into a vocal ally of marginalized communities, with a willingness to acknowledge and rectify his mistakes; and with the release of El Último Tour Del Mundo, he’s made history with the first-ever No. 1 Spanish-language album on Billboard’s album chart. No other artist had more Spotify streams in 2020.For El Último Tour Del Mundo, Bad Bunny transports himself a decade into the future, imagining the music he’d play on his final world tour in 2030. It’s not his best record, but that’s almost beside the point. You’ll still find vestiges of his particular nuevo reggaetón sound on tracks like “Te Mudaste” and “Dákiti,” even if the latter is one of its weakest examples, pummeling the dembow riddim into submission with a thumping four-on-the-floor that’s devoid of any actual flavor. But by track four he takes a sharp left turn from the rap and perreo that defined previous LPs in favor of a morose, introspective vibe that pulls from British post-punk and the rock en español of Central and South America as much as it does the hip-hop and R&B of the American South.For better or worse, El Ultimó Tour Del Mundo’s rock sound leans heavily on producer Marco “MAG” Borrero (and, to a lesser extent, Borrero’s human riff machine Mick Coogan), best known for crafting pop hits for the likes of Flo Rida, Bebe Rexha, and Selena Gomez. The collaboration doesn’t always work; tracks like “Te Deseo Lo Mejor” and “Antes Que Se Acabe” suffer from a saccharine sound that’s generic enough to blend in with Top 40 radio. But when it does, it’s sublime. “Yo Visto Así” and “La Droga” inhabit the same universe of distorted emo rap as the late Lil Peep and Juice WRLD, with grunge guitars ringing out over rumbling trap beats. And “Maldita Pobreza,” a poor man’s lament that effortlessly bounces between buoyant new-wave riffs and booming 808s, evokes Café Tacvba, New Order, and modern-day traperos in equal measure, offering a glimpse of the brilliance that can result from Benito’s experimentation."

This divine being, as she depicts it, is unafraid and unburdened of its duties; “A nadie le debo,” Uchis sings. It owes no one—and neither does she.This epiphany marks Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞, or Without Fear (of Love and Other Demons) ∞, as her most honest work yet. The 26-year-old is a little dreamier, a little bolder, and a lot freer than she was two years ago when she released her genre-roving debut Isolation, a record that cemented her place as pop’s misfit siren. While working on it, though, Uchis felt like she had to “prove” herself to the world, so the polymath corralled a crew of bigwig artists and producers—including Tyler, the Creator, Bootsy Collins, and Gorillaz—to bolster her already singular work.Fittingly, on Sin Miedo, Uchis dares to trust herself more. She pares down the guest list, opting for feature production by Puerto Rican hitmaker Tainy and a smattering of artists. Her voice, still thick and sultry, looms larger in the mix. And her affinity for jukebox jams sees her turning to the past again—but instead of only containing the funky breaks and trippy jazz stylings that Anglo-market listeners have come to recognize her music for, Uchis sharpens the spotlight on her bilingual, binational Latinx repertoire. She’s consigned her tragic Edie Sedgwick avatar to oblivion; this is Uchis in ’90s mami glam, grown as fuck at her Friday night perreo parties and Saturday morning limpiezas, ready to recover reggaetón and boleros for the new age.Some of the sweetest flashbacks on Sin Miedo are actually covers of classic tracks, relaunched with pithy little missives worthy of a telenovela script (for what it’s worth, Uchis has always wanted to be a director). On opener “la luna enamorada,” an update of a 1960s bolero once made popular by the Cuban doo-wop group Los Zafiros, Uchis quips, “¿Y tú qué pensaste, que yo me iba a echar a morir?” (“And what did you think, that I was going to roll over and die?”). Uchis even nails a glimmering tribute to the Queen of Latin Soul, La Lupe, plugging her tour-favorite rendition of “Qué te Pedí” in as an interlude. For just under two minutes, Uchis sings with a gauzy gemido, aching with devotion to a selfish lover whose demands remain impossible to meet. Sometimes, even bad bitches get trapped."

More often than not, it ends up sounding like a Broadway tribute.","In Daisy Jones & the Six, the bestselling novel inspired by Fleetwood Mac’s tumultuous history, Taylor Jenkins Reid writes an album’s worth of song lyrics to hint at her fictional band’s pathos. In the climactic “Regret Me,” frontwoman Daisy Jones delivers a devastating burn to her co-lead and songwriting partner, Billy Dunne: “When you think of me, I hope it ruins rock’n’roll.” It’s a terrible line, but in the book it’s met with shock and awe. Reid’s lyrics are packed with zingers capturing the vocalists’ romantic tension, a strain that ultimately spells the Six’s undoing.“Regret Me” gets the full studio treatment in the Amazon Original series, an adaptation of Reid’s book. While the TV version of that song is outfitted with new lyrics, the barbs are similarly clunky: “Go ahead and regret me/But I’m beating you to it, dude.” Still, the soundtrack album accompanying the series, Aurora, is a can’t-lose proposition for producer Blake Mills. With crack session players and a fathomless budget behind him, he gets to chase his own Laurel Canyon masterpiece; the fictional conceit provides cover when he falls short. Contributors on this record include Marcus Mumford, Madison Cunningham, and Roger Joseph Manning Jr. The fact that they got the Jackson Browne to write music for the adaptation of a supermarket novel says more about the record biz than Amazon’s mockumentary possibly could.At its most ambitious, Aurora approximates the incremental trajectories of Fleetwood Mac’s late-’70s work. “Let Me Down Easy” and “Regret Me” careen through striking melodic pivots, anchored by warm Rhodes keys and the vocal harmonies of actors Sam Claflin and Riley Keough, who play Jones and Dunne in the series. On “Look at Us Now (Honeycomb),” the acoustic chords and kick drum gather momentum en route to a soaring single-chord guitar solo. It’s a clear nod to Rumours’ “The Chain,” but the degree of intricacy—not to mention the bravura guitar work—makes for a rewarding homage.Mills knows that trying to replicate Fleetwood Mac’s opus is a fool’s errand, so he hedges his bets. The title track is more redolent of the Nashville machine than Laurel Canyon, and the vocal duets betray a Broadway sheen. On “Look at Us Now,” Claflin’s exaggerated vibrato fails to compensate for underwritten lyrics: “I don’t know who I am, baby, baby, baby/Do you know who you are? Is it out of our hands?” There’s no symbolism or mystique, no white-winged doves or Rhiannons—it’s hard to imagine any of these adult-contemporary show tunes cracking the FM rotation, let alone in 1977."

Yes, it's yet another side project release from the folks that brought you Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Set Fire to Flames and the Silver Mt. Zion Hoonja-Doonja Ice Cream Symposium. The fact that there's a Motherfucker (as in Jackie-O) along for the ride doesn't change the overriding MO of the primary players. Aurora is gorgeous, cinematic stuff, dominated by cello and eccentric percussive instruments like clevises and rototom shells. And, unsurprisingly, the packaging is equally gorgeous-- an embossed gatefold CD sleeve complete with black disc envelope and postcard, as well as slightly skewed typeface setting.Folks not yet inured to this collective's bombast and grandeur might be surprised by how gentle and serene these tracks are. ""Histories Repeating..."" lists in a foggy meditative fashion for nearly 17 minutes, while the comparatively pop-length ""Why She Swallows..."" twinkles and trembles. When there's a threat of the folks rocking out in a hamfisted fashion (as on the very first track, ""Quelques Mots Pleins D'ombre""), Esmerine opts to err on the demure side of aggression. Folks unfamiliar with all things godsped, but with a predilection for groups like Rachels and the Dirty Three, might also want to give this a try.For those that got over the gorgeous instrumentation and the importance of each telegraphed loud-soft shift and the interminable song titles sometime after Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada, this disc will seem relentlessly polite and tasteful. More importantly, Aurora won't sound much different than anything this group-- together or apart-- has already produced. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that, for all intents and purposes, it's the same thing."

Each line is rendered in careful, writerly fashion, his voice barely produced and almost never doubled, so there is often little to distinguish chorus from verse. Memories, boasts, threats—all of it simply spills out. His songs are informed by the drill music that Polo grew up on on Chicago’s North side and once tried to imitate, but also borrow from rap’s more classicist branches. This approach was perfectly crystallized on Die a Legend, his arresting debut album from last year, which plays like an LP made up exclusively of the bloodlettings that sneak onto some albums’ B-sides. Its hits seem inevitable outgrowths of Polo G’s larger approach, the way its verses slide naturally into hooks. And the world it creates is unspoiled by outside interference: no treacly A&R-insisted beats or clumsily grafted features. It was easy to get lost inside.Polo G’s follow-up, The Goat, is not quite so shut off to the world. Its front half is especially adventurous, folding in kinetic collaborations with rappers from North Carolina and Tennessee and tender love songs. It is not the singularly engrossing experience that Die a Legend is, but it argues for him as an adaptable and unmissable talent, an unlikely star in a new major-label system. When he does return to that well of somber reflection, Polo G draws some of his most chilling material yet: see the desperate “Relentless,” where he tries to convince skeptical friends: “Heaven ain’t the only way we can escape up out the gutter.”It cannot be overstated how plain Polo G’s preferred syntaxes are, and how unsettling an effect they can have depending on the subject matter. This is, after all, a young rapper whose biggest hit includes a chorus that goes “We come from poverty, man, we ain’t have a thing.” When he raps about pain or trauma from his childhood and teen years, he often refers to them as “pain” and “trauma”; rather than make his music vague, this clarity is a helpful guide through dense verses packed with detail. Take the shimmering “No Matter What,” where he laments that his new money and power can’t bring back his departed friends: “But my homies died young and that wasn't part of the plan/Flying on these planes, wish I could reach and touch your hand/I don't wanna be awake, that's why I keep popping these Xans.” The problems are laid bare and the solutions are destructive, but the music—its lyrics and its sound—is always searching for a sort of exaltation."

His skill as a curator helps sculpt a sticky, humid, psychedelic world with dazzling production and odd pleasures at every turn.","“Who put this shit together? I’m the glue” declares Travis Scott on Astroworld, and it’s hard to think of a more accurate summation of his aesthetic approach. The 26-year-old is an avatar for a generation of playlist-making curators who have positively embraced “creative” as a job title. He’s risen to mainstream rap prominence by way of pure tastemaking, exerting the au courant currency of borrowing exactly the right talent at exactly the right time since the hybrid hip-hop of his 2015 debut, Rodeo. Depending on a variety of factors—age, genre predilections, level of active investment in the myriad intersections between popular culture and social media—Scott’s artistic approach can come across as inspiring or infuriating, but it’s also proved undoubtedly successful.He’s wielded his own influence over areas of pop culture—Drake’s 2017 “playlist” More Life was arguably as influenced by Scott’s revolving-door A&R approach as it was by the evolving fluidity of the album format—even as he remains indebted to mentor Kanye West, whose titanic 2013 album Yeezus (to which Scott contributed) was its own ultra-collaborative, cut-and-paste monster. If Yeezus embraced by-committee creativity as a means to an end, Scott has taken it several steps further by allowing such an ethos to define his very artistic being. This has, of course, made him a divisive figure in hip-hop circles and elsewhere. A 2015 Deadspin post titled “Travis Scott Is Worse Than Iggy Azalea” made the case for Scott as a canny cultural plagiarist—a notion that became somewhat more fortified the following year, when he was accused of essentially stealing the framework for the Young Thug and Quavo collaboration “Pick Up the Phone” from Thug himself.The album that song appeared on, 2016’s Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, captured Scott in the process of refining the rougher edges of his sound, with bolder hooks and a slow tilt towards streamlined song structures. But last year’s full-length collab with Migos member Quavo, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, felt driftless and tossed-off by comparison, suggesting a weird paradox embedded in his career thus far: For someone so reliant on others to properly perfume his own work, Scott seems to be most engaged when he’s able to solely take credit for it.Such is the case with Astroworld, unquestionably his strongest release to date. The album takes its name from a since-shuttered amusement park in his hometown of Houston and often resembles a humid day spent at a carnival: sticky, sweet, bustling with activity, and packed with cheap thrills that still feel a tad overpriced. As far as trippy-sounding hip-hop goes, Scott is operating at something of a gold standard here, out-hallucinating fellow stylist A$AP Rocky’s own recent blotter-blotted efforts. “Psychedelics got me goin’ crazy,” he lolls over the spooky and beautiful “Stargazing,” his voice sounding like a sentient iTunes visualizer as he nods to Houston legend Big Moe and shouts out Ellen DeGeneres. It's the epitome of the Travis Scott experience."

In the data-dump era, where artists churn out as much music as they can, he makes two songs in the time it might take others to make 20. He is careful and meticulous, malleable and introspective.  His sound totters between drill and pop, sometimes hard, sometimes smooth. Eventually, he blurs the lines between them.All of this is on full display on his brutal, powerful debut, Die a Legend. The title sounds like an epic fate, the kind that befalls a mythical hero. But for Polo G, it’s more of a cautionary tale. In his estimation, there’s no praise until you’re gone, and by then, it’s too late. He wants to leave a legacy, but he also knows you have to survive long enough to create one. The album art features photos of eight people in the clouds, like the ones you see tacked onto posterboards at funerals. Die a Legend honors their stories, their memories, their legends, with a painstaking account of the kind of violence that cost them their lives. It is one of the finest rap debuts of the year.What draws you even closer to Polo G is the heartfelt essence of his raps. He can dive into the nooks and crannies of his life story or take an eagle-eye perspective, but he does both with a hypnotic, penetrating conviction. His songs are deeply meditative, and, in turn, revealing. “My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don’t get no sleep,” he raps. It’s that penchant for overthinking that’s led him to anatomize his own pain so carefully and so potently. His verses are so smooth and vivid it’s like you are a breath away from him at all times.Polo G allows his songs to be jointless. With hardly another guest on this album (save for Lil Tjay on the sullen party hit “Pop Out”), his hooks feed directly into verses, like a snake swallowing its tail. They are simple but well-rendered, each distinctive but of a kind. Sometimes he’ll rap an entire verse in the same rhyme scheme (“Last Strike”), something he likely picked up listening to Gucci Mane. Maintaining the same end rhyme throughout sounds less involved than untangling knotty wordplay, and many purists see doing so as less complex. But it takes a talented rapper to ride out a single current for an entire 16 bars, especially when each of its lines runs right into the next, as on “A King’s Nightmare”: “Spittin’ verses, I’m desperate, I need a mansion and a coupe/You done signed over your life and now you slavin’ in the booth/Now we hang ourself with chains, they used to make us rock a noose/Shorties hoppin’ off the porch ’cause it ain’t shit else to do.” That’s the difference between a wave-rider and a wave-maker."

Through her use of virtual reality, you were beside her as she crawled out of a cave and danced at dawn lakeside; you swirled inside her mouth or moved into her sherbert-neon computer-generated body. It was intimate to see and feel her isolation, her heartbreak, and ultimately her healing as she sewed up a wound in her chest and walked away. The final statement of Vulnicura’s sweeping narrative about ending a relationship with her longtime partner was that after all this, Björk was finally alone.It’s easier to create a utopia in isolation. If only we didn’t have this misbegotten, biologic desire to welcome someone else into our world. Another person? With me right now? I’m good, thanks. Yet most of us persist in this welcoming, an act that requires so much patience, compassion, and sacrifice because we believe that by co-organizing a perfect world for two, we might come closer to knowing love. Add to this small world a child and it seems like a miracle—a small paradise immune to the horrors outside of it. “If you feel this world is not heading the right way,” Björk said recently, “you have to be DIY and make a little fortress.” It’s within this matriarchal frame that Björk and her co-producer Alejandro Ghersi (aka Arca) created the challenging album Utopia. It’s a long, skittering discovery of googly-eyed romance, a rebuke of the violence inherited by men, and a generous offering of love song after love song, rendered musically with unerring elegance and passion.The four decades of Björk’s music can be seen, simply enough, as a long trek to detail every last tendril of spiritual energy and spark of emotion that has existed in the world. Her relationship to feeling is particularly spatial, living within environments built Björk-tough for all the screams and whispers of history: emotional landscapes, hidden places, internal nebulas, mutual coordinates. Her shift from avant-garde pop star to immersive multimedia artist is not brand-building in a career sense—rather, it’s in service of having more tools for this restless excavation of human senses, their origins and futures. If this seems high-minded, it’s because it is, but it’s also because Björk’s music now exists on ever grander musical staffs, her lingua franca is that which is rarely broached in casual conversation: How does it really feel to lose someone? How does it really feel to start loving again?"

Playboi Carti),0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0316,modern,7.9,Tijuana-based producer bests his lackluster debut with this compilation collecting his promising latest 12-inch and previously unreleased material.,"Fernando Corona is a producer from Tijuana who is one of the central figures in Baja, California's Nortec Collective. He started by releasing Matmos-ian traditional Mexican cut-ups as Terrestre, and in 2002, he debuted with the album Martes under the name Murcof. Along the way he's remixed, cut vinyl as the mastering engineer for the Static Discos label, and scored the independent film Nicotina. He's a busy guy with a lot of talent, this Fernando Corona. Remember the name.With Martes, Corona took fragments of 20th Century classical by composers like Morton Feldman and Arvo Pärt and combined the tense arrangements with micro beats. It was an interesting record with an unusual sound, but it wasn't ultimately great; something about the loops and repetition of Martes didn't seem to gel. Corona's conception called for freedom and openness, music unconstrained by the snap-to grid. For that we would have to wait another 18 months.The 12-inch single ""Ulysses"", released earlier this year, delivered completely on Martes' promise and immediately built anticipation for the next Murcof full-length, due by the end of 2004. On both ""Ulysses"" and the B-side ""Urano"", Corona ditched samples to write and record his own charts, melding percolating minimalist beats with his subtly dissonant and open-ended phrases for strings. On this CD, Leaf has rewarded those without turntables by compiling the two tracks from the ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, two previously unreleased tracks, and seven remixes of material from Martes.Beyond the exceptional ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, both unheard tracks here are good but sound like holdovers from the Martes sessions. ""Una"" loops and chops a short section for strings and sets the melody against an undercurrent of catgut groans and plucks. It's like a duet between two instruments from the violin family-- one set to play ""music"" and the other focusing on ""sounds."" ""Ultimatum"", which foregrounds the drum programming and uses bits of piano and violin more as seasoning, is probably the funkiest track Corona has released as Murcof.The remixes are mostly strong, with the two best coming from familiar names. Jan Jelinek's ""Der Abschied von Dawson City Mix"" of ""Maiz"" is an excellent meeting of the minds that finds Jelinek using clipped fragments of plucked violin and double-bass slides for his own jazzed-up rhythmic ends. Deathprod's take on ""Ulysses"" leaves little of the original identifiably intact, but creates the kind of vast, doom-laden half-speed drift that will be instantly familiar to those familiar with his excellent Morals and Dogma.Colleen's mix of ""Muium"" is inspired and imaginative, as Cécile Schott burrows deep inside the original track, emerging with handfuls of individual notes that are stretched into drones and reassembled into weird melodies. On the beat-friendly tip, Sutekh's ""Triasgion mix"" of ""Memoria"" is highly danceable and driving techno infested with squirming samples pushing in several directions simultaneously, while fellow Nortec Collective member Fax (Ruben Tamayo, not Pete Namlook) offers a dubby and comparatively warm take on ""Maiz"".Fernando Corona's distinctive stamp is clearly affixed to every note of his originals, so his music lends itself to the remix treatment. But most exciting on Ulysses are the two new tracks that (hopefully) point the way toward the next Murcof album. What Corona brings to the table is something depressingly rare in electronic music: a fresh ear. Like Ekkehard Ehlers, Corona seems to hear music differently, allowing him to compose tracks that sound like no one else."

The influence of the two pumps through the veins of Lil Baby and Gunna, just as it does any rapper who debuted in the city after 2014. The similarities between the two mixtapes are glaring as it’s a duo of Atlanta-bred melody-driven rappers that spit so damn well with each other, aware that if they go hard enough this is their shot at superstardom. But where Lil Baby and Gunna separate themselves is a chemistry and brotherhood that few rap duos can lay claim to.The chemistry of Lil Baby and Gunna breeds competition as the mixtape becomes a showcase of two rappers at the top of their game attempting to out-flex the other: If Gunna just copped a new coat, Lil Baby got a superior one that cost $6,500, and if Lil Baby has a VLONE hoodie, Gunna has the same one but in every color. They revealed their world of drip earlier this year when “Sold Out Dates” set the blueprint for Lil Baby and Gunna’s rapping style: a string-sampling instrumental from ATL mainstay Turbo, melodic Gunna hymns dedicated to his designer, and the gruffer bars of Lil Baby still acclimating to this life of showboating. This alchemy shapes Drip Harder into the rare major label collaborative mixtape that’s not on cruise control.From the beginning, Lil Baby and Gunna are all-in, recruiting high-profile guests like Lil Durk and Nav to follow their lead on a track definitely titled in a 2018 hip-hop name-generator, “Off White VLONE.” Gunna ushers everyone into the piano-laden world where not much matters other than if your belt buckle matches your Balenciaga runners. The duo calls on Drake to go in over the Tay Keith drums he loves so much on “Never Recover” and although Drake’s borrowed flow can’t keep up with Lil Baby and Gunna, none of their guests can, except for Young Thug. As their idol pops in on “My Jeans,” sliding in a chorus between their two short verses and it’s like a Dad taking his two sons to the basketball court to play one-on-one.Drip Harder thrives when Lil Baby and Gunna are alone, in their element, battling while also making sure to fill their quota of VLONE product placement (for instance, VLONE rims?). On “Drip Too Hard,” Lil Baby finds his melodic sweet spot on the hook only for Gunna to attempt to upstage him with smooth vocals that manage to keep his rapid delivery intact, all while tossing in a few boasts that are probably lies, but those are the best ones (“TSA harass me, so I took a private plane”). Their chemistry takes center stage on “Belly,” as Gunna passes his flow onto Baby who at this point is so confident he even celebrates his scent (“Spend thousands on fragrance she fuckin’ my odor”).The shortcomings come to light every time Baby and Gunna separate. When Turbo doesn’t have both Baby and Gunna flowing their asses off, his monotonous drums patterns grow tiresome. A few of his beats blend into one another, and he’s just not versatile enough to carry a project on his back. And even the bouncy Gunna solo track “Style Stealer” features Gunna comically unaware that dressing like Willy Wonka is not a flex (“Flawless choker round my throat/Icy cane like Willy Wonka”).Lil Baby and Gunna’s chemistry is a refreshing splash in an Atlanta hip-hop scene that has felt stagnant. It’s the duo establishing themselves, knowing they have some limitations, but capitalizing on what they do well. And even if they break up over some pettiness like Rich Gang, Drip Harder will be remembered as a moment that let hip-hop know it had two new superstars draped in “designer to the floor,” which, as Gunna said, “I can barely spell.”"

Baby came up watching Young Thug and Migos in the studio, and it was Thug’s eager cosign along with the backing of Migos’ label Quality Control that put him on the national radar last year, mere months after he picked up a microphone—an incredible stroke of fortune for someone who’d spent the previous two years “sitting in prison getting no mail,” as he puts it here.Baby’s rapping isn’t any flashier than his fashion sense. He rhymes in a tuneful, half-sung stream of thought, sort of like a more nuanced Rich Homie Quan. On a purely technical level, he’s impressive. His words are vivid, his emotions pronounced, and his flow is frictionless; he hovers just over every beat like a puck on an air hockey table. In a rap scene suddenly dominated by eccentrics and self-proclaimed rock stars, there’s room for a rapper this grounded, even if that isn’t the most exciting stake to claim. His practical, melodic flow is an alternative to Migos’ staccato patter or the indifference of SoundCloud rappers like Playboi Carti—a respectable option for listeners who like the general sound of Atlanta right now, but find some of those other guys over-the-top.Harder Than Ever is mostly of a piece with the mixtapes that preceded it, it does flaunt some of the privileges of Baby’s rising stature. The beats are a little better this time, more voluptuous and, yes, harder. Baby leans particularly on producer Quay Global, whose work is a bit like Baby’s delivery: polished, efficient, and kind of nondescript. And most prominently, Baby has landed a Drake feature, the ultimate score for any rapper looking to take their regional act global.What a debacle their collaboration turns out to be, though. While Drake does just enough to make sure “Yes Indeed” charts, Baby completely flubs his verse, inexplicably adopting a quirky flow that cuts against his entire persona. Pitching his voice somewhere between Young Thug at his whiniest and Pharrell’s deliberately dopey Swae Lee impression from “Chanel,” he even tests a dead-on-arrival catchphrase: “Wahhhh wahhhh wahhhh, bitch I’m Lil Baby.” It’s a complete misrepresentation of what he stands for, an introduction to a far more insufferable rapper than the one who’s been building heat for the last year.The album’s other features fare better, especially the ones from some of those aforementioned weirdos. Lil Uzi Vert and Young Thug both sweep through their tracks with the crazed velocity of untied helium balloons, and Offset absolutely crushes “Transporter,” sending volts through the track. Lil Baby takes his verse after Offset’s, and dexterous as it is, it’s a bit like trying to follow an incredible magic act with a PowerPoint presentation about fuel economy—highlighting the challenge of being a rapper as low-key as Baby. In a thrilling world of weirdos, it takes more than just showing up to make an impact."

It's his strongest release, thanks to sleek production by Metro Boomin.","By the time 21 Savage (real name Shayaa Joseph) committed to rap full-time, he’d seen and gone through hell: early trouble in school, getting shot, having multiple friends murdered. His entire career thus far plays like the PTSD aftermath of these horrors. When he raps, his deadpan delivery never betrays any hesitation or doubt. His voice dry and grainy, he recounts a life that has known nothing but violence, countering with the same violence back like a shield. His matter-of-fact delivery and unchanging cadence feels like the product of a hardened soul, and a desire to prove to be more terrifying than what lurks around you—a superman complex that says if you’re not the hunter, you’re the hunted.With Metro Boomin’s brooding, eerie production fitting onto his raps like a skin-tight costume, his latest release, Savage Mode, is his strongest and bleakest work. Credit Metro on another great job as a producer: Shaping his characteristically infectious sound to match the demented heaviness of 21’s verses, he creates a brooding collection that enhance 21’s disaffected cool. Savage Mode is vibrant despite being grim and understated; it's a street record where heavy lines like *“*Wet your mama’s house, wet your grandma’s house, keep shootin’ until somebody die/So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July” somehow bounce, and you find yourself nodding and flailing your arms. Those lyrics come from the plodding-yet-bouncy “No Heart,” which finds 21 sneering at “fake tough” rappers. When he raps, “Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville/Eighth grade started playin’ football, then I was like fuck the field/Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield/ Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I’m screaming fuck a deal,” he establishes what separates him from the rappers and shit talkers that claim a street life they don’t lead, but it also stands as an explanation for so much of the bleakness of the music and the performative apathy in how he treats violence; he’s been consumed by it in the most formative years of his life.The grimness of so much of the album tends to make the few moments of sweetness hit harder. The album’s one tender song, “Feel It,” is staid and unimaginative but nonetheless unashamedly vulnerable and loving. “These streets so dirty I just want someone who really there/Can’t fake love, just want someone who really care” he raps, suddenly switching off the menace for a second; when he follows it with “I’m savage to these niggas but to her I’m gentle” you believe him. This same softer note comes through in the dreamy, contemplative “Ocean Drive” as he raps about the places rapping has taken him that he never thought he’d see.There’s a lot to like and find invigorating about Savage Mode, but as a project, it is too conventional for its own good, never deviating from or adding anything fresh to the predictable beats expected of a trap record. It swims in violence, drugs and sex and only offers faint sketches of anything deeper. Sticking so squarely to the script precludes any possibility for 21 Savage to expand or break away; instead, it just sort of meanders about in well-trod territory.  Luckily, at only 9 tracks, the project doesn’t overstay its welcome. Just because something is predictable doesn’t stop it from being a good ride."

Lil Tjay),0.0,1.0,1.0,0.15,modern,8.3,Polo G blends pop and drill with ease and delivers a standout Chicago street rap debut that is meticulously crafted and honestly told.,"Chicago rapper Polo G is a writer in a world full of freestylers. In the data-dump era, where artists churn out as much music as they can, he makes two songs in the time it might take others to make 20. He is careful and meticulous, malleable and introspective.  His sound totters between drill and pop, sometimes hard, sometimes smooth. Eventually, he blurs the lines between them.All of this is on full display on his brutal, powerful debut, Die a Legend. The title sounds like an epic fate, the kind that befalls a mythical hero. But for Polo G, it’s more of a cautionary tale. In his estimation, there’s no praise until you’re gone, and by then, it’s too late. He wants to leave a legacy, but he also knows you have to survive long enough to create one. The album art features photos of eight people in the clouds, like the ones you see tacked onto posterboards at funerals. Die a Legend honors their stories, their memories, their legends, with a painstaking account of the kind of violence that cost them their lives. It is one of the finest rap debuts of the year.What draws you even closer to Polo G is the heartfelt essence of his raps. He can dive into the nooks and crannies of his life story or take an eagle-eye perspective, but he does both with a hypnotic, penetrating conviction. His songs are deeply meditative, and, in turn, revealing. “My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don’t get no sleep,” he raps. It’s that penchant for overthinking that’s led him to anatomize his own pain so carefully and so potently. His verses are so smooth and vivid it’s like you are a breath away from him at all times.Polo G allows his songs to be jointless. With hardly another guest on this album (save for Lil Tjay on the sullen party hit “Pop Out”), his hooks feed directly into verses, like a snake swallowing its tail. They are simple but well-rendered, each distinctive but of a kind. Sometimes he’ll rap an entire verse in the same rhyme scheme (“Last Strike”), something he likely picked up listening to Gucci Mane. Maintaining the same end rhyme throughout sounds less involved than untangling knotty wordplay, and many purists see doing so as less complex. But it takes a talented rapper to ride out a single current for an entire 16 bars, especially when each of its lines runs right into the next, as on “A King’s Nightmare”: “Spittin’ verses, I’m desperate, I need a mansion and a coupe/You done signed over your life and now you slavin’ in the booth/Now we hang ourself with chains, they used to make us rock a noose/Shorties hoppin’ off the porch ’cause it ain’t shit else to do.” That’s the difference between a wave-rider and a wave-maker."

On the cover of his Slaughter King mixtape he sported a hockey mask like Jason. His mixtape titles all evoke horror gore. His verses are built around heart-racing, hair-bristling anticipation. He preys on victims and terrorizes them, using intimidation and sadism, then jolts through quick shots of graphic violence narrated with stoned apathy. His songs are striking in their bluntness, breathless and macabre.Many rap marksmen ground their shootout confessions in the context of social inequality, making the distinction between hood survivalism and outright barbarism. 21 doesn’t care. He doesn’t dissociate murder from morality. He’s the self-professed Bad Guy praying to his Glock and his carbon. Alongside Metro Boomin, he refined his menace into a sting with Savage Mode, succinct in sound and ruthless vision, a 30-minute joyride inside the mind of Bishop from Juice.Capitalizing on the momentum, 21 Savage has returned with his debut, again accompanied by Metro, this time with assistance from Southside, Zaytoven, DJ Mustard, Jake One, Pi’erre Bourne (of “Magnolia” fame), and more. Issa Album, named for an interview segment gone viral, attempts to balance newfound fame with deep-rooted realness. He hasn’t softened, but he’s fixated more on riches than body counts. When he isn’t numbing his pain with the money, he’s struggling to put words to his emotions. 21 spends more time dealing with the living (his crew, his boo, and the girlfriends of rivals, specifically), and the feelings they impart. “I made it off the block, bitch I beat the statistics,” he rapped on Savage Mode, and Issa revels in the freedoms afforded by new money. It’s more ambitious, venturing down previously unexplored paths. But 21 simply doesn’t have the required finesse to cover more ground with nuance.With each passing release, 21’s deadpan muttering gets less effective. The imagery, which has always been somewhat lacking, is even more flat on Issa, the writing more clumsy. “Bank Account,” “Dead People,” and “Money Convo” all make the same banal comment about an increased cash flow, simply acknowledging the excess and enjoying counting the cash; he could’ve gotten the same result recording a money machine processing bills. Whenever he extends himself he comes up short (as on “Numb,” which aims to be a triumphant rags-to-riches revelation but somehow never musters a lick of enthusiasm). It isn’t difficult to draw a line from songs like “FaceTime” and “Special” back to Savage Mode’s “Feel It,” but his emotionless inflections do significantly less for attempted bando ballads this time around. On the latter, as he continuously reiterates how in his feelings he is and how special she is in the plainest possible terms, it feels empty. “The internet won’t help you understand me,” he raps on “Famous,” seemingly insulating himself from criticism. But the quip is absurd coming from someone so easy to read."

The 22-year-old only began rapping in February, but he already has four mixtapes, the backing of the taste-making Atlanta incubator Quality Control, and a major street hit, “My Dawg,” that just got the star remix treatment with verses from Quavo and Kodak Black. By March, Gucci Mane was already trying to sign him. Even in a city that breeds overnight successes faster than any other, Baby’s ascent has looked almost too easy.Credit Young Thug for fast-tracking Baby to the city’s inner circle. An old friend from the neighborhood, Thug cosigned the melodic rapper right out of the gate and appeared on some of his earliest tracks. As Baby tells it, even before he began rapping, he spent days in the studio watching Thug do his thing, internalizing his work ethic. Inevitably, he picked up a little bit of Thug’s singsong lilt, too, but his own delivery is considerably more subdued than the typical Thug performance. He sings in a slack, Auto-Tuned murmur, with an intrinsic tunefulness that suggests he could probably be a decent R&B singer if he put the work in. Despite his embrace of the word “hard” on the titles of his last solo mixtape, Harder Than Hard, and his latest, Too Hard, his voice is soft around the edges, almost pretty.Most of Too Hard finds Baby in a contemplative mood, still processing his sudden good fortune. “I went to prison, it made me a better me,” he croons on “Money Forever,” opposite Gunna, another singing rapper specializing in florid trap serenades. There are a lot of them right now. This is one of the most crowded lanes in rap, but Lil Baby distinguishes himself with a rare command over his voice. The quieter he goes, the more emotion he conveys.That delivery heightens his already-sharp storytelling. On the tape’s most vividly written track, “Best of Me,” he relays a close call. “Remember that shootout we had that time we thought a kid died?/Only thing I know is when we pulled up, everybody hopped out fine/I remember on the way back, everybody in the car quiet,” he raps somberly. He goes on to recall watching news coverage of the shooting and hoping the kid survived, knowing the ramifications if he didn’t. The chorus’ assurance that he isn’t embellishing—”Ain’t no facade, no cap in my raps, everything that I say is the real me”—is almost redundant. His voice is so sullen, so shaken, that there’s never any doubt whether he’s making any of it up.Tracks like that make it almost impossible to believe Baby’s been at this for less than a year. He’s got clear talent, and considering how much he’s improved just in the months since his first mixtape, Perfect Timing, his ceiling is potentially massive (even Young Thug’s earliest projects weren’t nearly this assured). Too Hard also has a potential hit in “All of a Sudden,” where Baby and an electric Moneybagg Yo ping-pong speedy bars off of one another, putting maximum spin on each. It’s one of the tape’s few outright bangers.What Baby still lacks, though, is an original vision—he’s skilled at parroting popular styles, but hasn’t yet honed his own. He isn’t helped in that regarded by Too Hard’s production, which is as refined and professional as you’d expect from the Quality Control stable, but also completely undistinguished, almost stubborn in its refusal to deviate from the most established sounds. He’s got time to figure it out, but for now Baby faces the same problem as many of his peers in Atlanta’s overcrowded rap scene: Talent can only take you so far when you sound so much like everybody else."

In late 2017, he was released back into the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, with a promise to his mother that things would be different. At first, he fell back into his old ways, skipping school to run the Bronx streets. Then, he stepped into a studio for the first time and recorded his breakout single “Resume.”On “Resume,” Lil Tjay sing-raps in a soft voice about his crushes with the charm of a mischievous early 2010s teen R&B star (think Prodigy of Mindless Behavior). At the same time, he reflects on the drug addicts he passes on his block everyday and the friends he’s lost while incarcerated. He perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid in a New York environment that rapidly forces you to mature. That conflict only becomes more profound on the singles that followed “Resume,” which he began uploading to YouTube every month or so. “Long Time” is a bittersweet ode to all of the friends he’s lost; “Goat” reflects on the low points he’s overcome; “Brothers” dredges up the past he’s still trying to distance himself from. By the end of summer 2018, Tjay’s melodic sense was refined and his stories tapped into an emotional honesty that made him a relatable breakout star in New York.Lil Tjay’s music was always suited for singles. There’s nothing wrong with that; so much of rap is consumed through playlists and YouTube videos. But when stretched across a 17-track album, like his debut, True 2 Myself, issues that were irrelevant before begin to surface: uniform vocals, half-cooked production, and writing that pulls from the same stories.True 2 Myself is more like a compilation than an album. On “F.N,” Tjay’s vivid reflections are given life by lush piano. “I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain/I ain’t have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain,” he raps, while keeping a steady melody. The album’s intro, “One Take,” is Tjay at his sharpest; every line over the sparkly keys has a purpose, especially when he addresses comparisons to fellow Bronx crooner A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie: “They said I’m the new A Boogie, relax/I ain’t never tried to copy his swag.” Each of these songs is just as good, maybe better, than early tracks like “Goat” and “Brothers”—both land on the album—but lose some of their luster when they’re all run together, and padded out with blander versions of the same piano-heavy street tales (“Dream That I Had,” “Post To Be”).The album format gives Tjay a little room to stretch, something that’s nearly impossible when he’s only releasing one single a month. Some experiments work, like the traditional R&B ballad “Mixed Emotions.” The “BET Uncut” slow jam “Sex Sounds,” meanwhile, is way too much: Hearing him sing “The way you kiss me when I’m stroking deep inside” is like finding porn in your little brother’s internet history.Lil Tjay wants to grow up, and an album feels like part of that process. But Tjay didn’t need an album; he notched a Billboard Top 15 single and became one of the rappers leading New York’s melody-driven scene without one. True 2 Myself is a playlist of soon-to-be singles grouped under the industry-formality heading of an “album.” Inevitably, one of these brooding piano ballads will catch on, followed by another, and Tjay, just like he did less than two years ago, will go on another run."

Now, he’s got the weight of YSL’s RICO case on his shoulders. Since he was released from jail in December, the generally tiresome social media conversation—driven by salacious Instagram and YouTube rags, plus a few rappers looking for attention—has focused on whether he “snitched.” But Gunna’s priority isn’t really responding to internet jokes. Instead, on his new album a Gift & a Curse, he’s trying to describe the emotional strain of a case that has torn apart brotherhoods and changed his outlook on life. He’s also attempting to keep the fun and lighthearted spirit of his prior music. The result is an album that is too vague to have much depth and too absorbed in real-life drama to have the feel-good vibes he wants to preserve.Lead single “Bread & Butter” sets the tone, balancing anger at friends who have turned their back on him with wistfulness for the old days when none of this was on his mind. It’s the kind of confessional, melodic pain rap that is popular in the Deep South, but the AutoTune-heavy singing is too monotone and polished for it to be effective; listen to how a crooner like Tampa’s T9ine lilts to make up for not having a big voice. Gunna could also attempt lyrical vulnerability, emulating the blunt poetics of an artist like Jacksonville’s Lil Poppa. But he is mostly still caught up trying to puff out his chest.I get it. He rose to the top of the Atlanta hip-hop ranks by being cool; it’s hard to dig in when he’s never really had to. Still, it’s frustrating when you can tell that he’s not being entirely real with you.

Of all the tracks on a Gift & a Curse, “Rodeo Dr” feels truest to where he’s at right now. The beat is brisk, the flows switch, and luxury goods are still in sight but he airs some frustration: “Fuck this shit, you know I’m still doing it for Jeff and Lil Keed,” he raps, and that “Fuck this shit” is more moving than any part where being moving is the point. Clearly, Gunna isn’t ready or willing to fully pull at his emotions. I’d rather hear the album he wants to make over the one he feels like he’s supposed to.

Now, he’s got the weight of YSL’s RICO case on his shoulders. Since he was released from jail in December, the generally tiresome social media conversation—driven by salacious Instagram and YouTube rags, plus a few rappers looking for attention—has focused on whether he “snitched.” But Gunna’s priority isn’t really responding to internet jokes. Instead, on his new album a Gift & a Curse, he’s trying to describe the emotional strain of a case that has torn apart brotherhoods and changed his outlook on life. He’s also attempting to keep the fun and lighthearted spirit of his prior music. The result is an album that is too vague to have much depth and too absorbed in real-life drama to have the feel-good vibes he wants to preserve.Lead single “Bread & Butter” sets the tone, balancing anger at friends who have turned their back on him with wistfulness for the old days when none of this was on his mind. It’s the kind of confessional, melodic pain rap that is popular in the Deep South, but the AutoTune-heavy singing is too monotone and polished for it to be effective; listen to how a crooner like Tampa’s T9ine lilts to make up for not having a big voice. Gunna could also attempt lyrical vulnerability, emulating the blunt poetics of an artist like Jacksonville’s Lil Poppa. But he is mostly still caught up trying to puff out his chest.I get it. He rose to the top of the Atlanta hip-hop ranks by being cool; it’s hard to dig in when he’s never really had to. Still, it’s frustrating when you can tell that he’s not being entirely real with you.

Morgan Wallen),0.0,1.0,11.0,0.0105,modern,6.3,"The drill rapper’s mainstream takeover continues with an engaging, guest-heavy, but otherwise run-of-the-mill album.","It’s no exaggeration to say that Lil Durk has been constantly healing from trauma for over a decade. As a member of drill’s first wave in Chicago in the early 2010s, Durk’s music has always been rife with amped-up tales that rumble with intense gun-fueled action and the physical and emotional fallout that follows it. But the sheer amount of hardship and loss he’s suffered, like many from his background, is staggering—to the point where every new project is both a victory lap and a pressure-release valve. Life has not let up on this dude: He’s one of the most popular and successful rappers in the world but the PTSD from a constant drip of lost family and friends keeps him on edge.Up until Almost Healed, his eighth solo album, the therapeutic benefits of his music have mostly been subtextual, relegated to his tone and the sheer weight of his stories. At least it’s never been as heavy-handed as it is on the opening skit “Therapy Session,” where Alicia Keys stiltedly asks him about the deaths of King Von, his brother DThang, and his ongoing beefs with YoungBoy Never Broke Again and Gunna with the airy chirp of an overeager guidance counselor. It’s a mawkish start to an otherwise engaging and scattershot album.Whether he’s mean-mugging his way through the trenches or opening up about his broken heart, Durk brings his words to life like a comic book splash page. The proper opening track “Pelle Coat” foregrounds those talents with four minutes of traumatic memories, visceral action, and YouTubers on his shit list. Scenarios tumble out over Chopsquad DJ’s slight keyboards and hi-hats: snitches, bodies in the street, the guilt over the deaths of Von and his cousin Nuski, Durk’s mother suggesting he decamp to Detroit. But one observation near the beginning of the third verse is a one-two knock-out: “I send money to funerals/Even though they goin’ to hell for all them niggas they killed/You know I'm part of my brother 'nem forever ever, I'm goin’ to hell.” The trail of death he’s seen is harrowing enough, but Durk acknowledging that he’s essentially damned himself beyond salvation is chilling. It’s a heartbreaking moment in a discography full of them, the kind that only comes from the darkest forms of experience.“Pelle Coat” is a hell of an opener, hitting heights that Almost Healed doesn’t reach again for the rest of its runtime. Every song doesn’t need to rip the listener’s heart out, but the rest of the album jumps between these personal revelations, sappy crossover treacle, and standard drill-and-pain tracks. Lead single “All My Life” walks a tightrope between the earnest sociopolitical pleas of Lil Baby’s “The Bigger Picture” and the goodhearted PSA hogwash of Logic’s “1-800-273-8255,” complete with a choir of children singing its hook."

Between his Snapchats, his advice book, the luxury furniture line (We the Best Home), the podcast, and his reinvention as a self-help guru, Khaled has spent the last decade in pursuit of constant virality, too in on the joke for it to be funny anymore. Following his motivational triumph routine in 2021 feels like discovering you still have the T-Pain app or Lil B’s Basedmojis on your phone—you remember why everyone found them amusing, but you’re a little embarrassed that you once did, too.Buying into DJ Khaled’s shtick has never been a prerequisite for enjoying his music, though. He’s always taken a backseat to the collaborations he curates; and lately, he’s been less of a presence on his albums than ever—he doesn’t even shout or ad-lib much anymore, and that was his one thing. There’s a growing disconnect between Khaled the gregarious living meme and Khaled the auto-pilot behind star-studded rap albums with all the individuality of a Now That’s What I Call Music compilation. Khaled Khaled is his 12th record, and we’re so used to them by now that you can forget what a radical exercise they are: rap albums where the A&R rep is the star, unapologetic unit shifters that don’t even disguise their disinterest in artistry, cohesion, or substance.Khaled’s albums weren’t always this cynical. His earliest records lovingly hyped his native Florida rap scene and other kindred pockets of the south. But over the years, he lost any sense of scene stewardship, and his purview expanded to include anything that sells—out went Trick Daddy and in came Justin Bieber, who joins 21 Savage on one of Khaled Khaled’s lowlights, “Let It Go,” recycling the summery, Bud Light Lime-A-Rita vibes of 2017’s “I’m The One.” Consider it one of Khaled’s unwritten keys: If it worked before, then repeat. It’s not for nothing that he’s made “Another one...” one of his guiding mantras.Khaled’s aversion to risk is unrivaled: He gathers the biggest names in rap, then has them make the same music they’d record on their own anyway. Sometimes staying out of the way works—the album’s first two singles were just Drake solo tracks with Khaled’s name on them. But the returns are never more than the sum of the talent involved. Put Lil Durk and Lil Baby (in the first of his three features on the record) over a brass-knuckled Tay Keith beat on “Every Chance I Get,” and you get an undeniable banger. Weigh down H.E.R. with messy Migos and Meek Mill verses, and you’re cutting your losses."

First it was with a song called “All Girls Are the Same,” which is obviously bratty and stupid, but also sneakily catchy and endearing in the way it casts Higgins as a bit of a heartbroken doofus. “Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it,” he sings in a monotonous drone. Another single quickly followed, and Juice WRLD’s first official album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, fell out of the sky just months after news he’d signed a deal with a major label. As a result, Higgins feels a bit like a ringer who has been hidden from view and unveiled all at once.It’s possible Higgins has enjoyed such a rapid climb due to the familiarity of the emo-rap he trades in. But that same familiarity can nag at the ear and force comparisons. He can sound warbly and frustrated—one part Lil Yachty and one part Post Malone—or depressed and histrionic, like Lil Peep and nothing,nowhere. To be sure, Higgins has latched onto this wave of emo-rap in both sound and lyrics, and Interscope has invested in his timely recipe of weepy trap because he’s such a convincing aggregate of the sound. If there’s an urgency to Goodbye & Good Riddance it’s not so much what is inside the album, but the timing of its delivery.Goodbye & Good Riddance is an adolescent breakup record, and it’s accordingly cathartic, petty, and clumsy in its emotional processing. It’s as hard to like Higgins as it is easy to pity him. The album cover signals some of this schtick with a campy anime drawing of Higgins doing a burnout, sticking his middle finger out the window, and literally leaving a woman in his dust. It’s a small-minded, juvenile gesture that fits hand-in-hand with that lead single and the general sulkiness of the rest of the album. Higgins sings at a persistent “you” throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, but he’s clearly self-obsessed in a moment of torment, paralyzed by heartbreak but not to the point that he can’t crawl in front of a mirror to glance at himself fall apart. For Higgins, heartbreak is performative and despondency is chic.Thankfully, there’s an emotional immediacy to the music and Higgins is doing more than just spinning his wheels. He sings often in weepy groans and emo snarls that match the blunt rawness of his lyrics, even if he’s in the habit of telling instead of showing his feelings (“Who am I kiddin’?/All this jealousy and agony that I sit in”). He also often grimaces through vapid clunkers like “I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay/I know it's all in my head.” These aren’t lyrics that can be delivered with tact, and Higgins hams it up at every turn. What he lacks in narrative, he makes up for in moody hooks, to the point that the nursery-rhyme simplicity of his singsong couplets can wash away the groaning melodrama of a line like, “I’m on the drugs way too much” and needle it into your skull. The tragic upshot of the album—love sucks, drugs help—is as productively communicated by song titles like “I”ll Be Fine,” “Scared of Love,” and “Hurt Me” as the lyrics inside of them.The more pressing accomplishment on Goodbye & Good Riddance is that Higgins has crystallized the sonic footprint of this emo-rap moment. The production is handled mostly by Higgins’ frequent collaborator Nick Mira, who encourages the maudlin effect of Higgins’ writing with mawkish synth atmospheres and fidgeting trap snares; the same current runs through the whole tracklist like a wet blanket.Other than the cringey voicemail skits peppered throughout, Higgins stands alone on the album without a single feature to accompany him. Even if his draw is relatability, it could have scanned awkward to hear Higgins share this space with anyone else. Throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, his heart-on-his-sleeve coping sounds both ingratiating and grating. In that way at least, he’s bottled up sad sap adolescence remarkably well."

He’s not the kind of vicar to pass around the collection plate; there are pentagrams and animal skulls dispersed throughout. He levitates menacingly, his hair’s an angry shade of crimson, there’s a green serpent here as well. Neat!Trippie Redd’s brand of emo rap is similarly hackneyed. That doesn’t stop him from making these consummate odes to heartbreak. But while his sad songs sound a touch more authentic and sensible here, the overall doom-and-gloom shtick is starting to wear thin. A Love Letter to You 3 showcases the benefits of refining a long-running aesthetic while also revealing its main limitation: the looming sense that things are getting a bit stale.Trippie Redd’s caterwauling makes his music endearing when it connects and grating when it misses. Since the release of A Love Letter to You 2, he’s tuned-up his emotional screeches to sound a little more soothing and milky. A Love Letter to You 3 begins with “Topanga” that builds a somber soundtrack for Trippie’s most vulnerable-sounding carols yet. He sings about gunplay with newly polished vocals.  Gone are the simplistic choruses and general sleaze weighed down his songwriting; in its place is a multi-part refrain that indicates a degree of familiarity with his faults. It quickly establishes a familiar somber mood that gets further excavated throughout the project as he digs into emo rap’s fascination with brandishing pain’s outcomes. The idea isn’t novel but it’s a little more fleshed out than many of his peers.Thankfully, he’s not chasing hits, which made Life’s a Trip an uneven slog. A Love Letter to You 3 is a blended affair of melancholy music with a gentle alt-rock atmosphere and plucky guitar strings throughout. “Toxic Waste” blooms smooth and slowly, similar to the slightly more lively “Love Scars 3.” Its consistency, aside from the drowning 808s of “1400/999 Freestyle” which feature an eye-rolling tough guy act from Juice WRLD, lends to its authenticity and flowing nature. Without the potholes, it’s a smoother ride.But while consistency can be read as a strong point, it also makes these songs naggingly predictable. This is the third installment of his flagship series and, now, the tortured-soul act is wearing thin. “I Tried Loving” borders on pestering whining with a heartless ode about heartbreak. There’s at least four relationship-ending songs up here and they begin to bleed together after a couple of listens. Without the bright, creative spots, the doom and gloom begin to feel manufactured to adhere to an aesthetic that he seems lost without. This is frightening because when there’s nothing zippy left to snap attention to, interest begins to wane. A Love Letter 3 is hopefully a farewell for Trippie’s puppy-eyed passages. This is a rare case where the music can be technically sound, yet be largely dismissible because there’s no growth. Emo rap is a crowded space with more innovative artists than Trippie; to eat again, he’ll need to change up his hunting style."

It’s bleak and beautiful.","At 21, Juice WRLD had begun to master the world around him. He could wed the sounds of influences like Billy Idol and Chief Keef and create something entirely different. As a songwriter, he could pair an airy melody with lyrics about heartbreak or drugs, and given the chance, fire off marathon freestyle sessions on a whim. A wunderkind with many imitators on SoundCloud, he sounded far more polished, far beyond whatever his closest peer was attempting to accomplish. When he died in December 2019, days removed from celebrating his 21st birthday, it opened up yet another wound for a generation of rap fans struggling to hold on to the new voices that spoke for them.Juice WRLD brought people from outside the margins into his crystalized world of vulnerability in a dash towards mental freedom. His most fervently repeated lines doubled as yearbook quotes or quickly deleted tweets. His closest supporters, such as producer and longtime collaborator Nick Mira, have kept his legacy close to them, maybe more so than any other group of fans who recently lost their champion. Juice asked those fans to trust him—and the people who supported him—as if they were family. Legends Never Die, the Chicago artist’s first posthumous release, doesn’t feel like a final goodbye from Juice but instead a continued look inside his world.Across three major releases—Goodbye & Good Riddance, WRLD on Drugs, and Death Race for Love—Juice proudly kept himself at a distance while pining for love, bringing fans closer to his truth while still keeping his guard up. The bulk of Legends Never Die sifts through his thoughts as he battled anxiety in the face of stardom. He understood the game he played and how it kept him centered: “If it wasn’t for the pills, I wouldn’t be here,” he sings on “Wishing Well.” It’s a bleak and beautiful world he’s created, one where the most poignant moments are buried in candor and honesty.Throughout Legends Never Die’s 56 minutes, Juice’s delivery is conversational and evocative as he checks off the perks of success and the lingering doubts (“Just got a new house, gotta hide the skeletons in the closet”). The emo-heavy sounds that blossomed on Death Race’s “Robbery” and “Empty” have now morphed into a fully developed ecosystem where all of the sounds and keys are built around Juice’s frame of mind. Mira’s touches on Legends Never Die don’t appear until the harrowing “Righteous,” where sparse guitar plays underneath Juice’s confessional: “Taking medicine to fix all of the damage/My anxiety the size of a planet,” he sings. Pop heavyweights such Dr. Luke and Marshmello grab the mantle on “Wishing Well” and the pop-rock ready anthem “Come & Go,” where Juice thanks God for allowing him grace and support."

Chinx was a street savvy rapper with solid pop instincts and singsong sensibilities (not unlike his label boss French Montana) who was cut down just as he’d begun to blossom. His posthumous debut album, Welcome to JFK, was a reflection of his promise, and served as both a finely-curated introduction and a proper send-off. JFK was a swan song capped by the closer “Die Young” with the powerful and prescient final bar “I pray I be okay when I grow up a little bigger/If I don’t, tell my babies daddy was a real nigga.” As endnotes go, it doesn’t get more fitting than that. So releasing another record postmortem, with a myth-building title like Legends Never Die, feels suspiciously like a branding play, less concerned with eulogizing Chinx’s art and instead setting its sights on his legacy. In its rush to glory, Legends Never Die becomes the one thing a legacy album can’t be: forgettable.When remembering Chinx’s brief career, listeners should refer to his Cocaine Riot mixtape series, which fully captured his bellowed melodies and joyous dope dealer romps without the stakes. In an attempting to build an obelisk out of scraps, the stakes are simply too high on Legends Never Die and these hard-drive cloggers couldn’t hope to live up to them. The songs are all clearly outtakes from the same cobbled together sessions and recordings that birthed Welcome to JFK—it has the same cast of producers (Blickie Blaze, Young Stokes, Lee on the Beats, Austin Powerz, and Remo the Hitmaker) and many of the same guests (Montana, Meet Sims, and another verse from the late Stack Bundles), only worse execution. The feature verses are bland and the album is poorly sequenced. The middle section is scattered and uneven, sandwiching a grating poacher tune like “Slide Up in Ya Bitch” in between a ballad (“Yeah I Do”) and a ride or die anthem (“Real Bitch”). The album should end with the Montana-assisted “Legendary,” but doesn’t. None of these tracks are among Chinx’s best or even his most fun work, and attempting to use them to cement his legend, ironically, seems shortsighted.Despite missing its mark, Legends Never Die isn’t without purpose—it's still refreshing to hear new Chinx verses and hooks, which are surprisingly earwormy. In a way, the album unfolds as the Book of Chinx, recounting how he lived and died: getting rich selling coke, living a luxurious lifestyle, and trading shots with bitter enemies and jealous rivals. A song like “Around Me,” which applies “fuck nigga” repellant, reads like his mantra and there’s some haunting foreshadowing in lyrics like “Shit a nigga seen, couldn’t live through it/Nigga used to stop at the red light/Now a nigga dip through it.” (There’s even a bar about coming through the block in a Porsche.) But inside these songs he’s present; he wins, he reflects, he prays, he jokes, he loves, he loots, and he lives. For 50 minutes, Chinx breathes again.When Legends Never Die is working well, it embodies Chinx’s spirit, showing off his versatility in the process. The strobing “For the Love” finds him in full croon, delivering one of his strongest vocal performances of his career with Meet Sims at his back. On “Crown Royal,” he wades into a wave of heavy 808 bass with choppy cadences crowning himself a coke kingpin (“Got the accolades on the corner/Dope from Peru, sniff from Tijuana”). “Like This,” which features smooth Chrisette Michele background vocals, is radio ready with plush synth arrangements and a hook that rattles around the brain. He does his cleanest writing on “Match That,” challenging competitors to match his accomplishments and drawing parallels in the same breath.In fits and starts, you can hear the gears turning; Chinx was finding his rhythm and might’ve developed into an astute craftsman given time. Now, all that remains are the drafts he left behind. Legends Never Die won’t preserve his legacy, but it’s another reminder of what could’ve been."

1fCeXjoRExPP2qwSBh2aST,0.736,147.946,0.776,arabic,-4.612,0.159,0.233,Juice WRLD,4.0,0.247,71,goodbye & good riddance,Arab X,Black & White,0.0,1.0,7.0,0.0802,modern,6.4,Juice WRLD’s emo-rap debut is an adolescent breakup record that is equal parts endearing and grating.,"The 19-year-old Illinois rapper Jared Higgins (aka Juice WRLD) arrived suddenly and fully formed on the Billboard charts over the last few months. First it was with a song called “All Girls Are the Same,” which is obviously bratty and stupid, but also sneakily catchy and endearing in the way it casts Higgins as a bit of a heartbroken doofus. “Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it,” he sings in a monotonous drone. Another single quickly followed, and Juice WRLD’s first official album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, fell out of the sky just months after news he’d signed a deal with a major label. As a result, Higgins feels a bit like a ringer who has been hidden from view and unveiled all at once.It’s possible Higgins has enjoyed such a rapid climb due to the familiarity of the emo-rap he trades in. But that same familiarity can nag at the ear and force comparisons. He can sound warbly and frustrated—one part Lil Yachty and one part Post Malone—or depressed and histrionic, like Lil Peep and nothing,nowhere. To be sure, Higgins has latched onto this wave of emo-rap in both sound and lyrics, and Interscope has invested in his timely recipe of weepy trap because he’s such a convincing aggregate of the sound. If there’s an urgency to Goodbye & Good Riddance it’s not so much what is inside the album, but the timing of its delivery.Goodbye & Good Riddance is an adolescent breakup record, and it’s accordingly cathartic, petty, and clumsy in its emotional processing. It’s as hard to like Higgins as it is easy to pity him. The album cover signals some of this schtick with a campy anime drawing of Higgins doing a burnout, sticking his middle finger out the window, and literally leaving a woman in his dust. It’s a small-minded, juvenile gesture that fits hand-in-hand with that lead single and the general sulkiness of the rest of the album. Higgins sings at a persistent “you” throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, but he’s clearly self-obsessed in a moment of torment, paralyzed by heartbreak but not to the point that he can’t crawl in front of a mirror to glance at himself fall apart. For Higgins, heartbreak is performative and despondency is chic.Thankfully, there’s an emotional immediacy to the music and Higgins is doing more than just spinning his wheels. He sings often in weepy groans and emo snarls that match the blunt rawness of his lyrics, even if he’s in the habit of telling instead of showing his feelings (“Who am I kiddin’?/All this jealousy and agony that I sit in”). He also often grimaces through vapid clunkers like “I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay/I know it's all in my head.” These aren’t lyrics that can be delivered with tact, and Higgins hams it up at every turn. What he lacks in narrative, he makes up for in moody hooks, to the point that the nursery-rhyme simplicity of his singsong couplets can wash away the groaning melodrama of a line like, “I’m on the drugs way too much” and needle it into your skull. The tragic upshot of the album—love sucks, drugs help—is as productively communicated by song titles like “I”ll Be Fine,” “Scared of Love,” and “Hurt Me” as the lyrics inside of them.The more pressing accomplishment on Goodbye & Good Riddance is that Higgins has crystallized the sonic footprint of this emo-rap moment. The production is handled mostly by Higgins’ frequent collaborator Nick Mira, who encourages the maudlin effect of Higgins’ writing with mawkish synth atmospheres and fidgeting trap snares; the same current runs through the whole tracklist like a wet blanket.Other than the cringey voicemail skits peppered throughout, Higgins stands alone on the album without a single feature to accompany him. Even if his draw is relatability, it could have scanned awkward to hear Higgins share this space with anyone else.

On “Olorun,” the meditative opener to his second album, Work of Art, he extols the Supreme Being of the Yoruba religion before praising himself. “I’m a brand new man,” he proclaims. Ahmed Ololade’s first love was dancing, but as much as he loved feeling the music, he knew the best way to make money was to become a consummate artist. He took up singing and adopted a stage name, and after a steady stream of singles he released his first full-length, Mr. Money With the Vibe, in 2022. It became Billboard’s highest-charting debut album from a Nigerian artist. He was, undoubtedly, a star.Asake’s first album was the culmination of ideas percolating throughout his home country. Most notably, it was amapiano—a strain of South African house music in the lineage of kwaito—that brought Asake’s Afrofusion music to another level. This regional style was already spreading across the continent—in Tanzania and Kenya, Namibia and Mozambique—and fellow Nigerians like Davido and Mayorkun were collaborating with South Africans to meld it with Afrobeats. What separated Asake from his peers was how he forged a sound all his own: He incorporated choral harmonies and string arrangements, and worked in elements of the Indigenous Yoruba music known as fújì. The opening track on his debut announced this audacious blend: “Dull” interpolated “Oke Agba” from the pioneering fújì musician Ayinde Barrister.With Work of Art, Asake understands that his winning formula needs no adjustments. Wistful strings inject solemnity on “What’s Up My G,” and as the characteristic log-drum loop of amapiano establishes a lithe beat, he expertly switches between vocal rhythms and inflections. There are many shades to his wealth, his nimble delivery implies. And when he lists off designer brands and luxury cars, the host of voices behind him frame his braggadocio as a spiritual act. “If you don’t feel blessed, you won’t be blessed,” he recently told ABC News. It sounds like the flipside to a Yoruba òwe, or proverb: “Ẹní lówó kó ṣe bí ọba” (“Whoever has riches should act like a king”).These two pithy statements reflect Asake’s own mindset of manifestation: His songs often read as a proposition that anyone who hustles can experience the blessings he’s had. On “Basquiat,” he makes sure to let you know that the “work of art” his album title refers to is, indeed, himself. Still, the song’s group chants remind you that celebration can and should be a communal act. Perhaps that’s why he’s so drawn to amapiano, a style of music that South African artist Thandiswa Mazwai has said reflects “how radical Black joy can be.” Inevitably, some of the most irresistible songs on Work of Art are cheery. “Sunshine” is an encouraging balm, its bubbly synths and rising vocal harmonies capturing the warmth of time spent with loved ones. “Awodi” is less summery but just as hopeful. Asake sings about rising from the slums, and his slow, patient delivery feels like he’s extending an arm to lift you up beside him.Stories of rebirth are nothing new, but Asake’s feel revelatory because they’re in constant search of innovation. “Amapiano” sheds some light on his approach. If the amapiano coming from South Africa is more tied to the country’s dance lineage, then Asake is intent on using it in bite-sized pop song form, as an avenue for intimate storytelling. But this isn’t to say that the production doesn’t stand out: “Great Guy” turns amapiano’s flagellating bass synths into pure, rumbling texture, while “2:30” lets them resonate in a way that recalls fújì’s talking drums. Closer “Yoga” even turns traditional séga—music that originated from enslaved Africans in Réunion and Mauritius—into a contemporary plea for peace. Asake grew up listening to Nigerian artists who continually evolved the country’s music, like Fela Kuti, Ayinla Omowura, and Wande Coal. His cross-generational, intercontinental music is doing the same."

A significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor.","The Albatross became a self-fulfilling prophecy for Foxing. While the St. Louis band's relentless touring enabled the slow-build success of their debut, the aching opening track on Dealer recounts the effect of Conor Murphy having to repeat ugly truths about himself night after night for the better part of two years: ""I am caught up in the guilt/ Making a living off of drowning."" Though Dealer is an artistic triumph and a significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor. And that's why, from its very first second, Murphy sounds drained over the prospect of doing it all over again—Dealer is not an easy listen. It sounds like it was very difficult to make, and reliving it is going to be even harder.It's in Foxing's nature to welcome a challenge. Of all the leading figures in the Fest-centered post-emo world, they made the most demanding, unique and self-assured debut. It certainly earned the genre tag—silvery guitar figures streaked and twinkled like tiny Explosions in the Sky, while Murphy's keening vocals delivered confrontational and caustic lyrics with spasmodic, burst-and-bloom dynamics. To paraphrase the slow-motion self-evisceration of ""Rory"" (think the Wrens' ""This Is Not What You Had Planned"" stretched to four minutes), he ripped his heart out while it was still beating and shoved it directly in your face. But Foxing are more interested in a renaissance than a ""revival"", and they mirror the adaptive and forward-thinking qualities of their scene, creating a new voice for familiar sentiments: There was certainly hints of Cap'n Jazz on Albatross, but also actual jazz, as well as Sufjan Stevens' baroque Americana and touches of avant-garde R&B.The Albatross darted fitfully and stretched out in all directions, while Dealer pulls all of Foxing's influences inward. Inverting his typical role of making burly post-rock bands sound delicate, producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Caspian) boosts Foxing's fragility—Dealer is constructed like an expensive timepiece where you can see every exacting movement behind a thick, glossy lacquer. Murphy's much-improved vocals negotiate the curvature of ""Weave""'s mournful melody and the band's syncopated sway—imagine what the Chicago late-'90s post-rock scene could've accomplished if they hooked up with the guys downstate in Urbana-Champaign. While there were short instrumental interludes on The Albatross, ""Winding Cloth"" is a full-on string orchestration, offering four minutes to absorb the shellshocked war reportage of ""Indica"" before segueing into the heavy-hearted poetry of ""Redwoods""."

Baby came up watching Young Thug and Migos in the studio, and it was Thug’s eager cosign along with the backing of Migos’ label Quality Control that put him on the national radar last year, mere months after he picked up a microphone—an incredible stroke of fortune for someone who’d spent the previous two years “sitting in prison getting no mail,” as he puts it here.Baby’s rapping isn’t any flashier than his fashion sense. He rhymes in a tuneful, half-sung stream of thought, sort of like a more nuanced Rich Homie Quan. On a purely technical level, he’s impressive. His words are vivid, his emotions pronounced, and his flow is frictionless; he hovers just over every beat like a puck on an air hockey table. In a rap scene suddenly dominated by eccentrics and self-proclaimed rock stars, there’s room for a rapper this grounded, even if that isn’t the most exciting stake to claim. His practical, melodic flow is an alternative to Migos’ staccato patter or the indifference of SoundCloud rappers like Playboi Carti—a respectable option for listeners who like the general sound of Atlanta right now, but find some of those other guys over-the-top.Harder Than Ever is mostly of a piece with the mixtapes that preceded it, it does flaunt some of the privileges of Baby’s rising stature. The beats are a little better this time, more voluptuous and, yes, harder. Baby leans particularly on producer Quay Global, whose work is a bit like Baby’s delivery: polished, efficient, and kind of nondescript. And most prominently, Baby has landed a Drake feature, the ultimate score for any rapper looking to take their regional act global.What a debacle their collaboration turns out to be, though. While Drake does just enough to make sure “Yes Indeed” charts, Baby completely flubs his verse, inexplicably adopting a quirky flow that cuts against his entire persona. Pitching his voice somewhere between Young Thug at his whiniest and Pharrell’s deliberately dopey Swae Lee impression from “Chanel,” he even tests a dead-on-arrival catchphrase: “Wahhhh wahhhh wahhhh, bitch I’m Lil Baby.” It’s a complete misrepresentation of what he stands for, an introduction to a far more insufferable rapper than the one who’s been building heat for the last year.The album’s other features fare better, especially the ones from some of those aforementioned weirdos. Lil Uzi Vert and Young Thug both sweep through their tracks with the crazed velocity of untied helium balloons, and Offset absolutely crushes “Transporter,” sending volts through the track. Lil Baby takes his verse after Offset’s, and dexterous as it is, it’s a bit like trying to follow an incredible magic act with a PowerPoint presentation about fuel economy—highlighting the challenge of being a rapper as low-key as Baby. In a thrilling world of weirdos, it takes more than just showing up to make an impact."

I ...","Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate, satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable, safe, forgettable.I have just summed up in 19 words what I am about to say about Coldplay's debut full-length, Parachutes, in 600. Aside from being seemingly tailor-made for the paper-thin adult contemporary market, what is it about this Britrock quartet that's driving them up the American charts? Is it their popularity in their home country, or their Mercury Music Prize nomination? Could it be their charming, boyish good looks? Perhaps, even, a reputation built by Noel Gallagher's projected insistence that they're ""a bunch of fuckin' pansies, the lot of them?""In reality, Coldplay's secret deadly weapon is vocalist Chris Martin. With the ability to mimic a Brit-accented Dave Matthews one minute, Jeff Buckley revived from the dead the next, and sometimes even a young Peter Gabriel, Martin's heartfelt delivery seems to be what's winning the hearts, wallets and alternative radio request lines of Americans young and old. That's not to say that the rest of the group isn't sharp. Guitarist Jon Buckland provides plaintive, strummed acoustic guitar with the occasional amplified wail, and bassist Guy Berryman with drummer Will Champion form a competent rhythm section.Oh yeah, the songs. They're nothing special. Most of the 10 tracks on Parachutes are indeed pleasant enough, often consisting of standard alterna-pop fare with the occasional folky ballad. They're innocent and inoffensive in general, but in turn, they're also exceedingly generic and immediately forgettable-- so much so, in fact, that after a minute of one song, you've usually already forgotten what the last song sounded like. And that's even after a few listens.Parachutes opens with ""Don't Panic,"" the title of which is likely lifted from British mock sci-fi classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with it. This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of ""We live in a beautiful world,"" which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record; the record also closes with the inspirational swinger ""Everything's Not Lost.""Most of the other songs sort of drift in and out of consciousness, with the exception of the second track, ""Shiver."" It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's ""Grace."" Martin has his Buckley impression down cold, complete with dynamic range and the trademark vibrato. But as enjoyable as the song may be, there's no question that Buckley did it better.And of course, you've probably heard their smash hit single, ""Yellow,"" by now. Indeed, it's the most obvious choice for a single, and it represents Martin's vocal stylings effectively, but it's also the record's weakest moment. Buckland's grating, slightly tuneless guitars seem jarring, especially when sequenced in the middle of a series of songs that generally lack dissonance. And the saccharine lyrics are those that might have caused Mr. Gallagher's hypothetical remark: ""Look at the stars/ Look how they shine for you/ And everything you do."" You'd practically expect the band to show up at your doorstep with a wilting bouquet and Hallmark card.Parachutes is ultimately a promising debut for Coldplay, if by ""promising,"" I mean, ""promising them a windfall of cash and international popularity."" If nothing else, it's harmless and pretty. Unfortunately, it's nothing else. If that's what you look for in your music, by all means, go for it. If you want substance, I suggest moving on."

Ugh. To Keery’s credit, making music is more than a passing vanity project; before he found life-altering fame playing Steve Harrington, the reformed bad boy of Stranger Things, he played guitar in the Chicago psych-rock band Post Animal. Over the last few years, in between roles as a murderous rideshare driver and a beleagured video game designer, he’s been kicking around a solo synth-pop project called Djo. As suggested by the moniker, which is pronounced like his first name, it’s still him—but with a wink.Djo’s vibes-forward second album, Decide, conceals its anxieties about change and identity beneath an onslaught of synthesizers and Auto-Tune, often in the interest of fun but occasionally to its detriment. Written and produced alongside Adam Thein, Decide takes full advantage of studio wizardry. Opener “Runner” begins with a series of borderline 8-bit bleeps as Keery commits to growth—“People never change/But I have to try”—delivered in a crystal-clear falsetto. Soon enough, the song transitions into a slicker, chromatic sound, all vocodered vocals and savvy electronica that wraps up with a strangled shout. Sometimes, the full-bodied pastiche can’t hide some clunky lyricism. “I know my hair looked good in the bathroom at the bar/Turns out I left my wallet at the bathroom bar” goes one such line on the Talking Heads-esque “Gloom.” An exploration of the pitfalls of ego—and potentially good-natured jab at his own famous mane—it’s a charming attempt at nodding to his audience, even if his songwriting isn't quite up for the challenge.It is ironic, then, that the best tracks on Decide tend to be the longer ones, when Keery’s instrumental impulses are allowed to spiral in unexpected directions (those psych rock roots die hard). While agonizing over the grip of social media, “Half Life” toggles between ominous stillness and bursts of sparkly brightness in a manner that evokes a dopamine loop. “On and On,” a song about doomscrolling, coasts along on a throbby wobble before skyrocketing into an arena rock-sized percussion breakdown.Decide is a fun, off-kilter synth-pop album that proves Keery’s talent, but by its conclusion, a clearer picture of its maker fails to emerge. (One lovely exception is “End of Beginning” with its lyrics about returning to Chicago and reconnecting with a past version of himself.) As on his debut TWENTY TWENTY, Djo proudly reps influences like Daft Punk and Tame Impala, borrowing their tricks without adding much in the way of innovation. Still, the lack of personal revelations is forgivable: Keery has explicitly said that he hoped the Djo persona—he sports a ’70s bowl cut wig onstage and in promo pics—would help distance himself from his onscreen roles. There is something tragic about an album preoccupied with the fakeries of technology made by someone whose fans have as largely formed a relationship with him through the screen. But with Djo, he is finding his way through the simulation."

When Drew Taggart and Alex Pall released “#SELFIE” in December 2013, they were relative nobodies trying to make a dent on the EDM scene. A month later, Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak label picked up the single—a novelty song about social media that suggested women are somehow more vain and annoying than men—and things started happening for the duo. But, like the viral spread of Baauer’s “Harlem Shake,” the success of “#SELFIE” and its attendant backlash threatened to eclipse their fledgling career.“We made a novelty record that was, in my opinion, one of the most clever records ever made... Obviously not everyone got the joke,” Taggart told Idolator in late 2015, gravely underestimating everyone's ability to get jokes. “But we’re working our way out of that and proving that we’re pretty well-rounded musicians.” So they abandoned their EDM to emphasize slower tempos, slinky melodies, and songs about bruised feelings. Whether they helped initiate the move away from super-sized dance music or merely sniffed the shifting winds, it was a canny move. In the past year, they have become one of the biggest names in pop music. On YouTube, a pair of videos for their single “Closer”—a moody, surprisingly convincing song about sex, regret, and the passage of time—has been viewed 1.6 billion times. Their 10 most popular songs on YouTube and Spotify alone account for a combined seven billion plays.This stylistic and emotional maturation is a big part of the narrative the Chainsmokers tell about themselves as party bros made good. The first lines we hear on the album are an apology: “You know I’m sorry,” sings a wounded, suspicious Taggart, sounding more like an emo singer than a superstar DJ, and it sets the brooding tone for an album preoccupied with breakups and betrayals. Musically, Memories… Do Not Open is of a piece with all of their output post-“Roses,” the single that marked their big shift. There are no big-room bangers, no concussive drops, no coked-up-mosquito-with-a-vuvuzela synth riffs. Diplo and Skrillex’s big hit for Justin Bieber, “Where Are Ü Now,” serves as the template for their pneumatic pads and processed vocals. With few exceptions—like “Break Up Every Night,” a peppy pop-rock number that could be a more caffeinated MAGIC!, or “Last Day Alive,” which features the country duo Florida Georgia Line in the musical equivalent of a poster of fighter jets—the duo and their 32 credited co-writers keep the tempos slow and the moods muted. It is an anodyne pop record for a post-EDM world, one where trap and trop-house mix with pale imitations of the Migos flow and Coldplay’s cornball sentimentality. None of it sounds anything like “#SELFIE,” but its worldview is barely any bigger than that song's narrow perspective; toggling between cheap thrills and bitter recriminations with all the emotional stakes of a drunken beach fight caught on Snapchat."

This being overwhelmingly the case, I will try my best to transport with words, and paint a picture of another time-- a time ever so slightly more innocent, when terrorism wasn't being used as an excuse to crush civil liberties and drop bombs on mustachioed megalomaniacs. So, drag that bottle of Orbitz out of the back of the closet, put X-Files on the VHS, and journey back with me to the year 2000.It was a wondrous time-- we were still fascinated by the three zeros that had signified the birth of the new millennium, and many were relieved to have escaped judgment from an infinite, intangible being. Then, toward the end of the year, we began to hear rumblings from the many-headed hydra of UK rock journalism that some amazing new music had come to usher us into the New World. This music was deemed fascinating, uncompromising and utterly prizeworthy by our English brethren, who spoke in hushed tones of how it was to be the coming of ""the next Radiohead,"" or perhaps more tellingly, ""the next Travis.""This new music was produced by a band of four affable blue-collar lads from Europe's island neighbor who called themselves Coldplay, and before you knew it, there was no escaping their lead-off single, ""Yellow"", as it burned itself into the national consciousness via extensive radio exposure and ABC promotional spots. I, myself, was never too taken with that single, though I openly admit to enjoying the album it was culled from, Parachutes. It was innocuous, to be sure, but it was also honestly rendered, and the opening three songs, effortless and hummable as they were, were hard to deny.Two years and a veritable avalanche of press later, A Rush of Blood to the Head has Coldplay taking a second shot at it, and to be perfectly honest, what they throw at the wall doesn't stick quite as well. I will credit them where it's due: they've admirably eschewed cloning their debut album, a path that would have been all too easy to take given that record's critical and commercial success. But while the sound of this album is more expansive, the influences a bit less obvious, and the approach more varied, the guys forgot to tote along their initial strength: the songs.Atmospherically, a couple of these tracks are remarkable-- particularly ""Daylight"", with its swooping guitar and synth lines. Even its strings, which echo melodies from Suede's last album, lend a sense of drama to a song that otherwise wouldn't hold much. Midtempo non-rockers ""Green Eyes"" and ""Warning Sign"" stretch the most obvious thread back to Parachutes with their lovelorn lyrics and slightly more developed melodies. And there are also a couple of ""memo to listener: we can rock, too!"" moments, specifically ""A Whisper"" and the lite-apocalypse of opener ""Politik"". The latter essentially takes the blueprint of ""Yellow""-- namely, the slamming, repetitive strumming of clean electric guitar-- and builds a more spacious song from it, one with more rattle and hum, but less melodic substance. Martin's double-tracked vocals hover curiously low in the mix and the band thrashes earnestly, but all the listener really comes away with is a nebular dustcloud and the sense that Coldplay want to break out of their box."

Though uneven, Lover is a bright, fun album with great emotional honesty.","The theme of Taylor Swift’s Lover is right there in the title. These 18 songs are odes to the things she loves most and knows best: her boyfriend and her mom, the West Village and the West End, and, always and forever on a Taylor Swift album, being in love. It’s an exuberant celebration of the challenges of maintaining a relationship through seasons and across continents, of telling the truth and saying sorry. Swift has always mined her personal life for opaque fables of love and retribution; she memorializes a romance’s fleeting details, wraps them in bows, and ferries them to an audience eager to receive her gifts. She writes about a life that’s strengthened, not broken, by heartbreak. Lover is the suggestion that the right person, the right song, might lift heartbreak from your life, too. The concept is, as she claims early on, both “overdramatic and true.”Lover nods to 2017’s Reputation, but, in spirit, it’s the sequel to the synth-pop glitter of 1989. Produced mostly with ubiquitous pop whisperer Jack Antonoff, it’s full of low-lying synthesizer pulses and reverbed beats that can feel more like scaffolding than full songs. Sometimes it attempts to honor Swift’s entire artistic journey at once: The waltzing “Lover,” full of fiddle and fairytale weddings, harks back to the Old Taylor; “I Think He Knows” is a thumping electro-pop shout-out to Nashville’s Music Row. She uses the word “shade” twice, up from once on Reputation. She’s 29, but she still writes metaphors about prom dresses and homecoming queens. It’s bright and fun and occasionally cloying.Lover’s emotional peaks and valleys are higher and deeper than reputation, where romance played out under a long shadow of doubt. Opener “I Forgot That You Existed” is a hopscotch rhythm set to a rhyme like you’d leave in your nemesis’ yearbook if you were really being honest—which is to say, it doesn’t sound like she forgot for one second. It comes off as throat-clearing, but it opens a stretch of drama-free delights, like the magnetic pink glow of “Cruel Summer” (“I don’t want to keep secrets just to keep you!”) and the crystal-ball clarity of “The Archer,” with its elegant, Chromatics-esque synthesizer build and self-aware regret: “I cut off my nose just to spite my face/And I hate my reflection for years and years.” The exception is undercooked gender-equality anthem “The Man,” a song that hilariously, unironically points to Leonardo DiCaprio’s playboy image as the height of masculine privilege, and proves that other people shouldn’t write Kesha songs."

In the half-century following Dr. King’s assassination, liberalism has turned him, a revolutionary figure once hated by the majority of white Americans for his commitment to racial, religious, and economic justice, into a convenient accessory through which to signal a vague, corporation-safe message in support of Black people. And if Bieber is anything, he is a corporation; perhaps that is why I don’t find it especially jarring to hear King’s exhortation for radical sacrifice juxtaposed with a song about being horny enough to walk through fire. On Instagram, I see this style of cognitive dissonance, or willful cynicism, deployed almost daily by media companies, influencers and celebrities, people I knew in college, even an Etsy plant store. This is just how we communicate now. Leave it to Bieber to, however unintentionally, hold up a mirror to a culture that doesn’t want to see itself.Paradoxically, behind the cringeworthy MLK controversy is a surprisingly compelling record, an earnest pop album that unearths the charisma and agility that helped make him a star to begin with. Bieber, now 27, seems to be having fun for the first time since his well-documented pubescence. After all, he is in something like the spring solstice of his life, having emerged from a period of distress that included heavy drug use and suicidal ideation into a well-adjusted millennial adulthood, grounded in the joys of marriage and the salvation of Christ. Whereas his last album, 2020’s R&B-led Changes, was burdened by the compulsion to prove to an antagonistic public that he’s no longer the baby-faced teen they first met nor the tempestuous shithead he soon became, Justice shows Bieber experimenting with ideas that are new to him, even if they are not new to the pop landscape.It’s buoyed by surprises at every turn, but never loses focus. The stadium jaunt “Die for You,” featuring Floridian pop parvenu Dominic Fike, ventures into pop-rock territory, a completely novel mode for Bieber. The synth-pop single “Hold On” begins as a ballad until the beat drops and curls around a serpentine bassline. “Ghost,” a song about grief, launches with a UK garage-lite beat, swells into a colossal hook, and eventually settles over a folky acoustic guitar. There might not be a hit on here the size of “Sorry,” but that's partly by design: This is Bieber's smoothest album-length statement to date."

As a young boy, he would watch his parents play gigs at resorts all across the Pacific, at once aware of the grotesquery of the tourist industry and enjoying the pleasures of island life—especially its music. Following the exuberant vulnerability of 2015’s Multi-Love and 2018’s Sex & Food, V, which was partially recorded in Hilo, Hawaii, figures as Nielson’s return to his past, and to the gorgeous sonics and breezy sadness of a childhood spent in paradise. Accordingly, there are big, ripe melodies that burst with bittersweet juice and are arguably among the best Nielson has ever written. But so much of this double album is lost in the fog of his production style, which, in its attempts to avoid being excessive, comes off as evasive and overly fussy. It ultimately makes V feel like a long, rummy sigh.Nielson’s songs have always been at odds with the way he chooses to record them. The faux-fi production he helped to forge—sweet vocals sung through grimy mic filters, songs squeezed with ear-popping compression—became one of the defining aesthetic markers of the indie rock of the last decade; the clipped and redlining drum sound of a UMO type beat will telegraph 2010s bedroom rock to future generations in the same way gated reverb connotes the megahits of the 1980s. Nielson’s best songs of the past few years, like Multi-Love’s title track, the flashing disco of “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone,” and even his cover of the Grateful Dead’s “Shakedown Street,” work with these restrictions by pressing beyond them, as if their funkiness and charisma couldn’t be confined to the basement in which they’d been recorded.To maintain this balance, the songs themselves either have to be strong and cohesive, embodying some kind of emotional urgency, or else fully embrace their own peripatetic nature and pursue vibes at all costs. On V, Nielson often hits upon a great idea—the brilliantly constructed melody and pleasingly stupid lyrics of 9-to-5 jam “Weekend Run”—only to stall out or double down. The choppy bossa nova that kicks off “The Widow” seems to offer limitless possibilities, but the instrumental song doesn’t seem to know what to do with them and settles for a bland verse-chorus-verse arrangement, begging for a vocal track. The knotty melody of “Guilty Pleasures,” and the elegant way it resolves into a dusky chorus, is nearly blotted out because it sounds like it’s being played on a turntable with an unbalanced tonearm. It feels perverse, or at least very un-punk, to wish that the guy who made “Ffunny Ffrends” would clean up his new songs, but the patina of authenticity the production is meant to provide is wearing thin."

A knowing nod to their favorite schlocky 1960s bands—the Monks, the Sonics, Screaming Lord Sutch—at first it suited them as back-combed, kohl-lined stickmen hailed by the British music press as saviors of garage rock. But when they returned with their second album, the shimmering, krautrock-tinged Primary Colours, the Horrors had become a very different band. Their sound has only grown more polished, euphoric, and populist since, on 2011’s Skying and its similarly glowing follow-up, Luminous, which cracked the UK top 10.The band were barely college age at the time of their scratchy garage-rock debut album, 2007’s Strange House, and so obviously precocious—particularly bassist and keyboardist Rhys Webb, the mod and psych aficionado growing a collection of vintage synths, and guitarist Josh Hayward, the physics grad with a knack for homebrewed guitar pedals—that they were bound to move on to headier influences. My Bloody Valentine, Can, Tangerine Dream, Brian Eno, and the Cure all became touchstones for a studio-forged sound that has occasionally been criticized as “record collectors’ rock”—a tasteful blend of retro influences that hardly inspires much in the way of horror. So after three albums in that vein, perhaps it’s no surprise that the next stage in their evolution entails the familiar rock‘n’roll journey back to their roots. “We wanted to get nasty,” says Webb of the new record, “and make something that sounded quite horrible and quite unsettling again.”Any band looking to do that within the parameters of soaring, arena-ready rock could do worse than look to Depeche Mode and the Cure for pointers, and the brooding grandeur of those alternative-pop godheads looms large over V. The band’s basic formula—simple, languid melodies, traditional verse-chorus structures interrupted by guitar and synth wig-outs—hasn’t changed, but the surfaces are grittier, the drums smack harder, and the vocals sit louder in the mix. It’s the first time since Primary Colours that they’ve enlisted an outside producer, handing the job to Paul Epworth, the British studio veteran who’s worked with Adele, Coldplay, and indie heavy hitters like Bloc Party and Florence and the Machine. As a band of accomplished studio nerds, they seem to have tapped Epworth not so much for his production skills as his ear for a huge hit, and on the album’s most anthemic tracks, it’s down to Faris Badwan—previously a slippery, mumbling presence both on- and off-stage—to carry it off. You can almost feel him squirming under Epworth’s gaze."

Accordingly, V sounds like a hangover. The best songs here will make for a welcome injection into his set list, reminding you of his keen ability for penning appealing ""woe-is-me"" anthems that won’t bruise you too badly in the pit.","In July, Nathan Williams became the latest musician to show you can take the boy out of indie but you can’t take the indie out of the boy: He got in a fight with his major label. Williams uploaded ""Way Too Much"", a single from his then-untitled new album, to SoundCloud, only to see Warner Bros. take it down. Without disclosing Warner’s motivation behind the takedown, he implied the label was threatening to sue him, and wrote, ""Its so obnoxious to work tirelessly on something and then have a bunch of ppl who just see me as a money sign go and fuck it all up.""On this, Warner was right: V is definitely not a record that’s going to make them a lot of money. That would require Williams writing the pop-punk crossover LP of his career—a little more Paramore, a little less Psychedelic Horseshit. Instead, what we have is an angry collection of songs more indebted to his recent collaboration with Cloud Nothings and the brute-force approach of his earlier releases, where punk catharsis was achieved by saying the same lyric over and over. (Say ""I’m so bored"" five times fast and you, in fact, will feel bored.)V was inspired by a breakup, as well as the band’s hellaciously bad habits: 100 beers and two bottles of Jameson a night for the four-piece group, a period of ""just drinking, straight drinking,” as Williams says in the album’s press materials. Accordingly, V sounds like a hangover. Every song starts somewhere dismal, and ends up somewhere that’s only a little hopeful—a process akin to the recovery from a hangover, when by the end you're mostly happy not to be drooling and vomiting on yourself. Multiple tracks refer to headaches both physical and spiritual. Williams’ budget has outsized the lo-fi recordings he made his name with, but he hasn't deviated much from the core formula. Though there’s room for easy-breezy surf rock (""Heavy Metal Detox""), insistent riffage (""Flamezesz"", ""Pony""), and shuddering sounds ripped from a horror movie (""Redlead""), the predominant aesthetic is dirty and discordant backed by big harmonies—the sweet spot from which all memorable Wavves songs emerge.It’s a faster record, too: V abandons Williams’ previous attempts at balladry, with all slow moments preceding the eventual assault. At times, the pace works to his advantage. Williams writes a killer hook, and it’s easy to hear crowds slamming along to the feel-bad vibes of ""Heavy Metal Detox"",  ""All the Same"", ""Way Too Much"", and ""My Head Hurts"". A line like ""I lost my job today, but it’s all the same"" (""All the Same"") is delivered much more happily than ""It gets better"" (""Pony""), a reminder that he’s better reveling in angst than trying to convince us it doesn’t matter."

The Swedish duo of Joakim Benon and Elin Kastlander were viewed as anonymous at first, but like many bands who enter the world that way, they now say that lurking in the shadows was simply a byproduct of releasing their music quickly, before they had a plan in place. However, even as we got to know them a little, and put faces to the sounds on record and on stages, they still seem unknowable: As Kastlander quotes Drake on their third record, V, it's their world, and they'll get high and/or die if they want to—and we're still stuck watching from outside no matter how cozy it sounds.But V does mark a shift for the duo. With this record, they've started capitalizing their name, and it's a formality that hints at the collection's bigger, fuller production and ambitions. They don't exactly sound like they're ready to fill stadiums, but they definitely got out of bed and recorded this in a proper studio. That said, even with the string swells, guitar solos, and bolder singing, the dozy sentiments are the same.It's easy to be briefly taken aback by the ominous instrumental opener, which sounds like a Cremaster soundtrack outtake, before a snippet of folkier sounds blend in toward the end. These are quickly cut, new-classical-style, by chimes and castanets before the strings and pulses of the rather grandiose first proper song, ""Dynasti"", which features strings, smeary vocals, and the expressed sentiment ""I want to be with you when we lose control."" As in the past, this is a couple's album, where that couple is the entire universe.It's followed by the single ""Dean & Me,"" which opens with this image: ""I know I'm drunk/ I know it's late/ But I will call you anyway."" The title and us-against-the-world vibe is reminiscent of M83's ""Kim & Jessie"", as the slightly drunk protagonist goes on, ""Something inside me tells me we should be together...I'm dancing with stars and they dancing with me."" The entirety of V carries a similar John Hughes-by way of-Saturdays=Youth vibe, albeit one viewed thru the lens of The Breakfast Club's ""weirdo"" Ally Sheedy character rather than Molly Ringwald."

After a release-free 2012, their return sees the pair augment their guitars with keyboard drones, digital rhythms, and kaleidoscopic synth hues.","Though their spectral music specializes in creeping guitar washes and slow drifts toward oblivion, there was no way for the California duo of Barn Owl to maintain the pace they once set. Between September 2009 and September 2011, multi-instrumental conjurers Evan Caminiti and Jon Porras released four full-length albums, each burrowing deeper into a mirage of droning desert blues. During that time, they also issued a brazen, roaring collaborative LP with Ellen Fullman, a composer who suspends wires in rooms to elicit extreme dynamics and radiating overtones. Porras and Caminiti stayed busy separately, too, pogoing between various boutique labels for solo records that pushed their group aesthetic to distinct extremes. Last year, they kept abreast of those individual paces, both releasing two fine LPs under their own names. But in 2012, there was no new Barn Owl material.The pause began after Lost in the Glare, a move that, in retrospect, seems like an optimal place for a Barn Owl semicolon. On those eight tracks, Caminiti and Porras’ intertwined guitars reached ideal levels of intensity and intimacy. On “Turiya”, featuring copacetic drummer Jacob Felix Heule, they let the tones bleed, playing their arid riffs with a force they’d never before managed. On “Light Echoes”, one of the prettiest pieces in the wide Barn Owl catalog, they repeated a trickling guitar line until it stretched into prismatic shimmer. Barn Owl had gotten very good at being itself.With Lost in the Glare, they also suggested they wanted to be something else. Aside from Heule, Barn Owl added bass clarinet, more percussion and, most presciently, an array of subtle synthesizer textures. So on V, Barn Owl’s proper fifth album, Caminiti and Porras return to the duo format to somewhat reinvent themselves, at least sonically. Though they both still list guitar as their primary instruments in the liner notes, the pair spend the bulk of V’s six tracks exploring keyboard drones, wide-set digital rhythms, kaleidoscopic synth hues, and barely there scrims of noise. The sustained electronics of “Blood Echo” reverberate as if from the mouth of a cave, with concussive thuds and streaks of sound suggesting the nascent work of European peers such as the Haxan Cloak and Raime. “Void Redux” seems like the hypothetical rendering of a session shared by Vangelis, Conrad Schnitzler, and Ennio Morricone; alternately, its dub inflections and colorful sprawl recall the more outer-atmosphere moments of Icon Give Thank, last year’s collaboration between the Congos, Sun Araw, and M. Geddes Gengras. “Against the Night” blooms like the best work of Tim Hecker, with sounds that float just past obvious perception suddenly rupturing into a euphoric rush."

On the covers of the first several releases by the international drone-doom duo of Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley and Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg, that insignia forced some shade of dark against another. On 2006's KTL, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient. Two years later, for 2, it had been bronzed and almost swallowed by a sea of blacks and browns, suggesting a steady wash of inescapable darkness. O'Malley and Rehberg began KTL, after all, in order to score Kindertotenlieder (which shares a name with a Mahler piece and translates as ""songs on the death of children""), a sort of hyper-reality play in which ""a group of teenagers get together for a death ritual in the form of a black metal concert."" Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them.The cover of V, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist Mark Fell adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic.The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of V strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, ""Tony"", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of Tim Hecker, Christian Fennesz, or Yellow Swans should find entry points here, while the more minimal maneuvers of Thomas Köner and Keith Fullerton Whitman seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the gravity of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (O'Malley is a co-founder, of course, while Rehberg has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, V is expansive and sprawling, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very different performers. On ""Phill 2"", Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a quarter-hour span that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the final piece here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", O'Malley and Rehberg finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover. The piece takes the name of the latest collaboration between American author Dennis Cooper and French puppeteer and playwright, Gisèle Vienne, the pair responsible for Kindertotenlieder-- and so, KTL. ""Last Spring"" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of Jonathan Capdevielle as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show in French. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks."

On 2006's KTL, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient. Two years later, for 2, it had been bronzed and almost swallowed by a sea of blacks and browns, suggesting a steady wash of inescapable darkness. O'Malley and Rehberg began KTL, after all, in order to score Kindertotenlieder (which shares a name with a Mahler piece and translates as ""songs on the death of children""), a sort of hyper-reality play in which ""a group of teenagers get together for a death ritual in the form of a black metal concert."" Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them.The cover of V, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist Mark Fell adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic.The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of V strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, ""Tony"", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of Tim Hecker, Christian Fennesz, or Yellow Swans should find entry points here, while the more minimal maneuvers of Thomas Köner and Keith Fullerton Whitman seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the gravity of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (O'Malley is a co-founder, of course, while Rehberg has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, V is expansive and sprawling, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very different performers. On ""Phill 2"", Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a quarter-hour span that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the final piece here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", O'Malley and Rehberg finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover. The piece takes the name of the latest collaboration between American author Dennis Cooper and French puppeteer and playwright, Gisèle Vienne, the pair responsible for Kindertotenlieder-- and so, KTL. ""Last Spring"" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of Jonathan Capdevielle as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show in French. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks."

In the mid-90s, Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green joined forces with sympathetic San Francisco souls Tim Soete and Josh Smith (who has been known to shred a few with über-black metal outfit Weakling), and immediately commenced to answer the question of what happens when you combine the strengths of Iron Maiden, Metallica and King Crimson and thrust that ornery beast upon indie rock audiences. The guys' first releases were independent cassettes, recorded as The Champs, which were available only at live shows. Soon after, they were pressured to change the bandname by the 60s group of the same name who'd had a hit with ""Tequila,"" so they opted instead to be known as C4AM95.C4AM95's first official full-length, the double-album III, hit stores in 1997 on Frenetic Records, and witnessed an already fully developed band at the height of their powers dropping not only mind-numbing cock-prog adventures, but also a few electronic vignettes that might not have sounded out of place on the Flash Gordon soundtrack. 2000's IV cut the length in half, but retained the concept entirely-- and it only won them more props.So, in the grand album tradition of Led Zeppelin and, well, Chicago, we now have V. The good news: nothing has changed; the bad news: uh, you like prog-metal, right? Hey, it could be worse (two words: Dream Theater). Besides, I defy anyone to find an ounce of pretension or bloated self-indulgence on this record. Wanky? Maybe, but probably less so than recent collaborators Trans Am, and anyway, the Fucking Champs own pretty much everyone in the super-rock department. There's a school of thought that says you have to make excuses for listening to stuff like this, but that kind of bullshit comes up limp in the face of the Champs' ability to ram a riff down your throat, not to mention their sheer sincerity.The two-part ""Never Enough Neck"" starts things off subtly, with a soft synth chord that crescendos into the crashing, distorted drums and guitars. They hit riffs one right after another, the tempo relentlessly quick and drummer Soete's dexterity stunning. The first part of the tune is fairly melodic, if full of typical Champs' crunch; the second switches up to a decidedly proggy tip, odd time signatures and all.The majestic (or as much as can be said of this band) ""Children Perceive the Hoax Cluster"" is actually a live track, replete with drunken screams and featuring Smith's considerable synthesizer atmospherics. The track forgoes percussive fury in lieu of pure 80s sci-fi mysticism (remember Ladyhawke?). This leads directly into another 80s trip, ""I Am the Album Cover,"" which is something like the shameful instrumental meeting of Iron Maiden and Survivor. To my ears, even though that kind of stuff might get the Champs' more press, I think it could potentially lead to novelty-band status. The track sounds like it may have been an old four-track experiment (the music on this disc dates as far back as '93), so maybe they're focusing on a more idiosyncratic sound now.The best tracks on V are the ones that throw caution and 80s kitsch out the window in favor of chops-ahoy-- like the up-tempo ""Happy Segovia,"" or the epic ""Aliens of Gold,"" which may be the best-ever example of trying to fuse the words 'prog' and 'metal,' while never uttering the word 'sux.' And yes, there is a metal version of a Bach tune here (\xA91723, so say the liner notes), so I suppose even the Fucking Champs aren't above the occasional Spinal Tap move. But you know, it fits right in with the other stuff. So I guess the moral is that if a band is good enough, plays hard enough, and does it without the slightest hint of irony, they can find people who'll love them regardless of the genre. Either that, or resurrecting the ghost of Randy Rhoads is the magic formula for making cool records. What do you think?"

Midway through Handwritten, he sings, ""Who came to wipe all your tears away? Who came to give you back your dignity, babe?"" The answer is easy to guess, but it's such a loaded, ugly moment that it's tempting to take the needle off the record, take a breather, get some space.But make sure to come back, just so you don't miss the whoa-oa-oas on ""Desire"", an effortlessly enormous chorus that give Fallon's philosophical more import than they earn.

With this, their third album, they dig in their heels and deliver more of the same.","""Don't Panic"", the opening track of Coldplay's first album, drew its title from the famous motto of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novels. Two albums later, it seems they chose the wrong Adams catchphrase; most of their recorded output is better exemplified by the Guide's description of Earth: ""Mostly harmless."" In their seven years together, Coldplay have risen to monumental levels of popularity on a potent mixture of nice-guy charm, serviceable songwriting, and general inoffensiveness. Unfortunately, these aren't the kind of traits that often lead to interesting music. Not that the band hasn't taken the occasional stabs at creativity and innovation; it's just that those attempts have always been carefully measured, or even nervously self-conscious.Coldplay have never seemed intent on world domination, but as their early singles caught on, journalists came waving raves. Then, with nearly 5 million copies of Parachutes sold worldwide and their popularity on the upswing, the band's sophomore album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, found the band unsure of how to advance. Luckily for them, their decision to virtually recreate Parachutes on a larger budget paid off commercially: The album got them tagged as ""the next U2,"" a ridiculously off-base coronation that ignores the fact that U2 recorded ""I Will Follow"", ""New Year's Day"", ""Bad"", and The Joshua Tree, among others, before they wandered off into the MOR wilderness.Coldplay, meanwhile, started in the middle of the road and haven't strayed since. Granted, they've produced a handful of good songs-- ""Don't Panic"", ""Shiver"", and ""The Scientist"" are all fine achievements, while ""Clocks"" remains a great piano part in search of an equally great melody-- but their albums have yet to justify the critical hyperbole, and their third full-length, X&Y;, isn't going to be the one to lock that down. Though dressed to the nines in big guitars and faultless musicianship, X&Y; is unable to lay claim to even a single song equal to any of the high points from their first two albums, and the band's obvious desire to be all things to all people doesn't help: They long to be huge and expansive, in The Unforgettable Fire mode (""A Message""), tear-jerking AOR balladeers (""Fix You""), and hip, Kraftwerk-referencing aesthetes (""Talk""), but at heart, they're really built for easy listening, which makes their rockers feel cursory and their ballads simpering.X&Y; is sequenced fast-song/slow-song through almost its entire running order, which means those of you uninterested in wading through doe-eyed love songs based on lazy rhyming couplets and trite resolutions have already lost half a disc's worth of music. You'll ""go backwards and then/ You'll go forwards again."" You'll ""get lost and then get found."" You'll notice that the first verse of ""Swallowed in the Sea"" (""You cut me down a tree/ And brought it back to me/ And that's what made me see/ Where I was coming from"") is somehow meaningless, yet also cliched. Had Coldplay accompanied these lyrics with remotely interesting or memorable music, this could be somewhat overlooked; sadly, ""Swallowed in the Sea"" is one of several aggressively banal ballads that sink this album into a sort of neo-Carpenters abyss."

Taylor Swift has explained that at length, in her own flowery vernacular: These 13 songs are “a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams.” The thoughts that keep the 32-year-old songwriter up late are the ones she’s spent nine albums excavating: the unpredictable rise and devastating fall of romance; the binary of the “good girl” and the “bad girl,” and the chafing of societal expectation (that “1950s shit”); and the uncomfortable acceptance of her own fallibility. Life, she declares, “is emotionally abusive.”Midnights is Swift’s first album to be recorded entirely with Jack Antonoff, after nearly a decade of ever higher-profile collaborations. In the past, he has accentuated Swift’s ambitiously vivid storytelling with expressive, technicolor synth pop. Here, in accordance with the lateness of the hour, they explore moodier, more subdued hues. Built around vocal effects and vintage synths, it’s an understated sound more interested in setting atmosphere than chasing trends. On the mid-album centerpiece “Midnight Rain,” against a backdrop as crystalline as the titular weather, Swift examines the pursuit of career over partnership. Exaggerating her natural uptalk, the production morphs her voice into a dramatic slant: “He wanted comfortable/I wanted that pain.” The woozy “Snow on the Beach” sketches an image of strange beauty in twinkling synth and violin, as Lana Del Rey’s warm background harmonies add a welcome coziness. Later, as Swift hesitantly enters a new relationship on “Labyrinth,” the production mirrors the ice melting around her heart, each synth quiver a pump of new blood.Building on the softly stuttering Reputation tracks “Delicate” and “Dress,” the album at times recalls the way the spare, hazy beats of Lorde’s Pure Heroine cut through the denser radio hits of the early 2010s. While it’s gratifying to hear Swift push her idea of pop beyond the fireworks of her pre-2020 material, the evolution can feel uneven. In her transition from the Americana-lite of Folklore back to sparkling synths, she’s also restored some of her more theatric impulses. On “Karma” she conjures her sassy, shit-stirring alter ego in a less vindictive mood, luxuriating in her rivals’ inevitable comeuppance. The ominous, wobbly murmur lurking beneath the revenge fantasy “Vigilante Shit” recalls Billie Eilish’s debut, though Swift’s attempts at edginess come across as a costume; she was a far more believable killer on Evermore’s murder-mystery ballad “No Body, No Crime.”"

Today, we revisit a teenage fever dream, the mainstream pop-punk debut of Avril Lavigne.","Avril Lavigne’s origin story would be the perfect American fairytale if it wasn’t so undeniably Canadian. She grew up in Napanee, Ontario, a small town best known for its proximity to the country’s largest highway and its selection of fine truck stops. She sang Pentecostal hymns in her family’s church and performed in local productions of Godspell and You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. It was little more than an average, provincial life.When the nearest big-city country station held a singing contest, a 14-year-old Lavigne sent in a tape for a chance to sing with none other than Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop superstar. Lavigne didn’t just acquit herself: She won the damn thing, which meant driving two-plus hours to the nation’s capital and belting Twain’s brassy 1993 hit “What Made You Say That” in front of a packed Ottawa hockey arena. At the time, Lavigne told Twain she wanted to be “a famous singer.”Lavigne had no idea how quickly her dream would come true: Within a few years, she’d be sneering on the cover of Rolling Stone in a black tank top and a curt plaid skirt, winkingly labeled “the Britney slayer.” The onetime country-pop princess who performed hits by Faith Hill and Sarah McLachlan at an early record label audition had become a gleeful anarchist, a pop-punk supernova who skated through videos for hits like “Complicated” and “Sk8er Boi,” causing chaos in ratty T-shirts and neckties. She wasn’t disingenuous or calculating; she was a teenager, one whose formative experiences and changes in taste were taking place while she navigated the expectations that come with a major-label record deal. The reaction between Lavigne’s volatile energy and the music industry’s commercial imperative produced her 2002 debut Let Go, a rebuttal of Spears-Aguilerian pop—overtly sexual, vaguely urban, hyper-processed—churned out by the exact same kind of hit factory. It boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.While Lavigne’s ascent from local radio contests to the top of the charts seems rapid in retrospect, her career took shape in fits and starts. Nine months after she appeared on stage with Twain, Cliff Fabri—the manager who shepherded her through the earliest phase of her career—watched her sing country karaoke in a Kingston, Ontario Chapters, the Canadian equivalent of being discovered in a college town’s Barnes & Noble. “I was thinking of her as another Sheryl Crow. They both had the same small-town roots,” Fabri told The New York Times in 2002. “Then I was thinking Fiona Apple, because of her independence. She definitely had attitude. So my line was Sheryl Crow meets Fiona Apple.”"

And remember how, after the Kennedy raves and MTV Beach House success of that song, Nada Surf did the graceful thing by fading quietly into obscurity and K-Tel royalties? That was really cool of them. Uh... they did fade quietly into obscurity, right?Hells no! Like the equally mystifying continued existence of their pan-flash peers Superdrag (sigh, WhosuckedouttheFEEEELAAAAAANNNNN!!), Nada Surf insists upon fading away rather than burning out. So now, they're dropping down to the minor leagues and trying to ignore showgoers' wiseass heckles as they tour America's low-overhead venues. If you're anything like me, there's a little voice inside of you saying, ""Dude, weird, they're still around? Shouldn't they be headlining the John Deere Alternative Rock Stage at the State Fair by now? Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so long outlived their original fifteen minutes?""Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little voice, who never did you no good anyhow. Let Go's only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds. Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny.Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say  the DB's and  The Replacements-- that'll suffice. All well and good, but the band also carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays.Said crimes include:Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"".Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the protagonist listening to Blonde on Blonde in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"".Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?).Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats.But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous ""Treading Water"". Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on Let Go, are gleefully shined into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to ruining albums by both Pavement and Phish.Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps. I'll admit, though: If forced to defend one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought. No, I'm afraid Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with Let Go, and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired."

They maintain their stadium status grandeur while subtly challenging preconceptions.","""No one knows what it means, but it's provocative… gets the people going."" A couple of Chris Martin's good buddies memorably flipped this obscure bit of Blades of Glory dialogue on Watch the Throne to annotate the purchase of Margiela jackets, but it's every bit as applicable to the title of Mylo Xyloto and speaks toward Coldplay's lofty ambitions on it. A new Coldplay album is the sort of thing that's used as a health check for the record industry, and the band is very much aware that they could just release ""a new Coldplay album"" that would leave everyone involved satisfied-- this is essentially what happened on 2005's X&Y, their fastest seller and also their weakest LP according to many. But being criticized as bantamweight compared to peers like U2, R.E.M., or Radiohead has clearly worn on them-- and truth is, they're all the better for their guilty conscience about a total lack of post-punk credentials. While Coldplay will always be more enjoyable than groundbreaking and their artistic advances seen as smart troubleshooting than divine intervention, Mylo Xyloto works because the band once again manages to sound like Coldplay without sounding like any of their previous LPs, maintaining their stadium-spanning grandeur while subtly challenging preconceptions.While retaining the studio services and crucial cosign of Brian Eno, it's a relief that their most carefully thought-out work initially sounds less ambitious than Viva La Vida, a record whose orchestral and political bombast felt at the very least a necessary act of aggressive rebranding. Mylo Xyloto is brighter in both attitude and especially timbre, sleeker, more emphatic and up to the task of being a capital-E Event. Though their collaboration with Rihanna on ""Princess of China"" makes it all the more explicit, when you're at Coldplay's level, pop acts are your competition and Mylo places itself in a lineage of ultra-mainstream rock records spanning from Born in the U.S.A. to Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix-- swaddled in synths and gilded by state-of-the-art production, but never too off-putting if you still insist that ""real music"" is played by men with guitars.Indeed, the militant, pound-the-dashboard beat that powers ""Hurts Like Heaven"" sounds like the band jockeying for the Boss' nod of approval. It's a remarkably aerodynamic piece of all-purpose inspirational rock that never gets too pushy even with Martin's meaningful/meaningless proclamations (""You use your heart as a weapon/ And it hurts like heaven""), tweaking its classicist template with a slight Auto-Tune on the falsetto harmonies. Likewise, the imperial march of ""Paradise"" is wheelhouse Coldplay, as is Martin's unfortunate tendency to stretch out syllables for rhymes that really aren't worth saving. But its power has little to do with whatever Martin's going on about (dreaming of paradise, mostly)-- it's all about how they unabashedly flirt with contemporary R&B production, cranking the drums way up in the mix and the massing the vocals on the chorus to overwhelming, Pavlovian effect. They don't want to completely do away with Coldplay qua Coldplay-- they're still four normal-looking guys who introduced themselves with frail post-The Bends Britrock like ""Yellow"" and ""Trouble"". But they continually ask, why limit themselves to that?"

But some of its most compelling moments are overpowered by the tedium of modern pop.","After decades of pop-culture hegemony, the gendered tropes around break-ups have finally been supplanted. Instead of tubs of ice cream and days spent wallowing on a couch, modern heartbreak is mitigated by the promise of a social media glow-up and encouraged by a culture obsessed with both wellness and politicizing the personal. A breakup is not the failure of a relationship, this contemporary approach preaches, but an opportunity for growth, no matter how uncomfortable. Or maybe it’s an expression of heteronormative hostility; men, we learn, are trash. Either way, pain can be a messy, divinely timed intervention from the universe. Manic, the third album by Halsey, is an unlikely, but effective, manifestation of this new convention. I can imagine many listeners finding comfort across its 16 songs, and similarly bridging angst and self-discovery to navigate personal crises of their own.A handful of Manic’s first six singles, among them the “Cry Me a River”-interpolating Billboard No. 1 “Without Me” and the country-pop manifesto “You Should Be Sad,” are rooted in the exploration of deep pain and what Halsey has described as an interest in “female rage.” That explains the lingering influence of artists once written off as angry women: Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette, and pre-acrobatics P!nk. (That more than a third of the album’s songs were released in its lead-up points to an altogether different convention: the pop album as a compilation of market-tested singles.) Notably, Halsey describes the album as the first project she has written as herself, New Jersey’s Ashley Frangipane, and not under the protective cover of her alter ego. Unlike 2017’s hopeless fountain kingdom and 2015’s BADLANDS, Manic is not structured around an elaborate fictional framework.For Halsey, autobiography offers opportunity; her ability to translate the arc of her life—schoolyard misfit turned aspiring bohème turned Tumblr microcelebrity turned misunderstood pop star—is among the qualities upon which she has established her career. She does well in framing some of those personal experiences as concepts, on standout songs like the pop-rock drunk-texting anthem “3am” and the melodramatic revenge drama “killing boys,” both of which manage to flip lonely self-awareness into a kind of strength. On the former, a song that deserves a bright future as a karaoke classic, she begs: “My insecurities are hurtin’ me/Someone please come and flirt with me.” Who among us hasn’t been there?Sadly, some of the album’s most compelling moments are overpowered by the tedium of modern pop. There are painfully stretched ballads, overly sanitized rhythms, a hint of indeterminately “tropical” energy, and back-to-back booming hooks à la Sia. (Halsey’s first record company was Astralwerks, the mostly electronic label with whom Sia released an album in 2004.) Alongside guest appearances from Morissette, Dominic Fike, and Suga of BTS, Halsey’s collaborators on Manic include Greg Kurstin, Benny Blanco, and Jon Bellion, some of the world’s foremost hitmakers and shapers of the amorphous, chameleonic pop I’ve come to associate with sitting miserably in the backseat of a Lyft. Their presence here is felt a little too acutely."

As a young boy, he would watch his parents play gigs at resorts all across the Pacific, at once aware of the grotesquery of the tourist industry and enjoying the pleasures of island life—especially its music. Following the exuberant vulnerability of 2015’s Multi-Love and 2018’s Sex & Food, V, which was partially recorded in Hilo, Hawaii, figures as Nielson’s return to his past, and to the gorgeous sonics and breezy sadness of a childhood spent in paradise. Accordingly, there are big, ripe melodies that burst with bittersweet juice and are arguably among the best Nielson has ever written. But so much of this double album is lost in the fog of his production style, which, in its attempts to avoid being excessive, comes off as evasive and overly fussy. It ultimately makes V feel like a long, rummy sigh.Nielson’s songs have always been at odds with the way he chooses to record them. The faux-fi production he helped to forge—sweet vocals sung through grimy mic filters, songs squeezed with ear-popping compression—became one of the defining aesthetic markers of the indie rock of the last decade; the clipped and redlining drum sound of a UMO type beat will telegraph 2010s bedroom rock to future generations in the same way gated reverb connotes the megahits of the 1980s. Nielson’s best songs of the past few years, like Multi-Love’s title track, the flashing disco of “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone,” and even his cover of the Grateful Dead’s “Shakedown Street,” work with these restrictions by pressing beyond them, as if their funkiness and charisma couldn’t be confined to the basement in which they’d been recorded.To maintain this balance, the songs themselves either have to be strong and cohesive, embodying some kind of emotional urgency, or else fully embrace their own peripatetic nature and pursue vibes at all costs. On V, Nielson often hits upon a great idea—the brilliantly constructed melody and pleasingly stupid lyrics of 9-to-5 jam “Weekend Run”—only to stall out or double down. The choppy bossa nova that kicks off “The Widow” seems to offer limitless possibilities, but the instrumental song doesn’t seem to know what to do with them and settles for a bland verse-chorus-verse arrangement, begging for a vocal track. The knotty melody of “Guilty Pleasures,” and the elegant way it resolves into a dusky chorus, is nearly blotted out because it sounds like it’s being played on a turntable with an unbalanced tonearm. It feels perverse, or at least very un-punk, to wish that the guy who made “Ffunny Ffrends” would clean up his new songs, but the patina of authenticity the production is meant to provide is wearing thin."

A knowing nod to their favorite schlocky 1960s bands—the Monks, the Sonics, Screaming Lord Sutch—at first it suited them as back-combed, kohl-lined stickmen hailed by the British music press as saviors of garage rock. But when they returned with their second album, the shimmering, krautrock-tinged Primary Colours, the Horrors had become a very different band. Their sound has only grown more polished, euphoric, and populist since, on 2011’s Skying and its similarly glowing follow-up, Luminous, which cracked the UK top 10.The band were barely college age at the time of their scratchy garage-rock debut album, 2007’s Strange House, and so obviously precocious—particularly bassist and keyboardist Rhys Webb, the mod and psych aficionado growing a collection of vintage synths, and guitarist Josh Hayward, the physics grad with a knack for homebrewed guitar pedals—that they were bound to move on to headier influences. My Bloody Valentine, Can, Tangerine Dream, Brian Eno, and the Cure all became touchstones for a studio-forged sound that has occasionally been criticized as “record collectors’ rock”—a tasteful blend of retro influences that hardly inspires much in the way of horror. So after three albums in that vein, perhaps it’s no surprise that the next stage in their evolution entails the familiar rock‘n’roll journey back to their roots. “We wanted to get nasty,” says Webb of the new record, “and make something that sounded quite horrible and quite unsettling again.”Any band looking to do that within the parameters of soaring, arena-ready rock could do worse than look to Depeche Mode and the Cure for pointers, and the brooding grandeur of those alternative-pop godheads looms large over V. The band’s basic formula—simple, languid melodies, traditional verse-chorus structures interrupted by guitar and synth wig-outs—hasn’t changed, but the surfaces are grittier, the drums smack harder, and the vocals sit louder in the mix. It’s the first time since Primary Colours that they’ve enlisted an outside producer, handing the job to Paul Epworth, the British studio veteran who’s worked with Adele, Coldplay, and indie heavy hitters like Bloc Party and Florence and the Machine. As a band of accomplished studio nerds, they seem to have tapped Epworth not so much for his production skills as his ear for a huge hit, and on the album’s most anthemic tracks, it’s down to Faris Badwan—previously a slippery, mumbling presence both on- and off-stage—to carry it off. You can almost feel him squirming under Epworth’s gaze."

Accordingly, V sounds like a hangover. The best songs here will make for a welcome injection into his set list, reminding you of his keen ability for penning appealing ""woe-is-me"" anthems that won’t bruise you too badly in the pit.","In July, Nathan Williams became the latest musician to show you can take the boy out of indie but you can’t take the indie out of the boy: He got in a fight with his major label. Williams uploaded ""Way Too Much"", a single from his then-untitled new album, to SoundCloud, only to see Warner Bros. take it down. Without disclosing Warner’s motivation behind the takedown, he implied the label was threatening to sue him, and wrote, ""Its so obnoxious to work tirelessly on something and then have a bunch of ppl who just see me as a money sign go and fuck it all up.""On this, Warner was right: V is definitely not a record that’s going to make them a lot of money. That would require Williams writing the pop-punk crossover LP of his career—a little more Paramore, a little less Psychedelic Horseshit. Instead, what we have is an angry collection of songs more indebted to his recent collaboration with Cloud Nothings and the brute-force approach of his earlier releases, where punk catharsis was achieved by saying the same lyric over and over. (Say ""I’m so bored"" five times fast and you, in fact, will feel bored.)V was inspired by a breakup, as well as the band’s hellaciously bad habits: 100 beers and two bottles of Jameson a night for the four-piece group, a period of ""just drinking, straight drinking,” as Williams says in the album’s press materials. Accordingly, V sounds like a hangover. Every song starts somewhere dismal, and ends up somewhere that’s only a little hopeful—a process akin to the recovery from a hangover, when by the end you're mostly happy not to be drooling and vomiting on yourself. Multiple tracks refer to headaches both physical and spiritual. Williams’ budget has outsized the lo-fi recordings he made his name with, but he hasn't deviated much from the core formula. Though there’s room for easy-breezy surf rock (""Heavy Metal Detox""), insistent riffage (""Flamezesz"", ""Pony""), and shuddering sounds ripped from a horror movie (""Redlead""), the predominant aesthetic is dirty and discordant backed by big harmonies—the sweet spot from which all memorable Wavves songs emerge.It’s a faster record, too: V abandons Williams’ previous attempts at balladry, with all slow moments preceding the eventual assault. At times, the pace works to his advantage. Williams writes a killer hook, and it’s easy to hear crowds slamming along to the feel-bad vibes of ""Heavy Metal Detox"",  ""All the Same"", ""Way Too Much"", and ""My Head Hurts"". A line like ""I lost my job today, but it’s all the same"" (""All the Same"") is delivered much more happily than ""It gets better"" (""Pony""), a reminder that he’s better reveling in angst than trying to convince us it doesn’t matter."

Even with the added string swells, guitar solos, and bolder singing, the Swedish duo's dozy sentiments are the same as they always were.","For the past few years, JJ have created and charmingly articulated their own small romantic world, a place that mixes dreamy sadness with drug lingo and the language of hip-hop with airy soft-pop atmospherics—all of it the product of two seeming stoners who can't be bothered to leave their house. The Swedish duo of Joakim Benon and Elin Kastlander were viewed as anonymous at first, but like many bands who enter the world that way, they now say that lurking in the shadows was simply a byproduct of releasing their music quickly, before they had a plan in place. However, even as we got to know them a little, and put faces to the sounds on record and on stages, they still seem unknowable: As Kastlander quotes Drake on their third record, V, it's their world, and they'll get high and/or die if they want to—and we're still stuck watching from outside no matter how cozy it sounds.But V does mark a shift for the duo. With this record, they've started capitalizing their name, and it's a formality that hints at the collection's bigger, fuller production and ambitions. They don't exactly sound like they're ready to fill stadiums, but they definitely got out of bed and recorded this in a proper studio. That said, even with the string swells, guitar solos, and bolder singing, the dozy sentiments are the same.It's easy to be briefly taken aback by the ominous instrumental opener, which sounds like a Cremaster soundtrack outtake, before a snippet of folkier sounds blend in toward the end. These are quickly cut, new-classical-style, by chimes and castanets before the strings and pulses of the rather grandiose first proper song, ""Dynasti"", which features strings, smeary vocals, and the expressed sentiment ""I want to be with you when we lose control."" As in the past, this is a couple's album, where that couple is the entire universe.It's followed by the single ""Dean & Me,"" which opens with this image: ""I know I'm drunk/ I know it's late/ But I will call you anyway."" The title and us-against-the-world vibe is reminiscent of M83's ""Kim & Jessie"", as the slightly drunk protagonist goes on, ""Something inside me tells me we should be together...I'm dancing with stars and they dancing with me."" The entirety of V carries a similar John Hughes-by way of-Saturdays=Youth vibe, albeit one viewed thru the lens of The Breakfast Club's ""weirdo"" Ally Sheedy character rather than Molly Ringwald."

After a release-free 2012, their return sees the pair augment their guitars with keyboard drones, digital rhythms, and kaleidoscopic synth hues.","Though their spectral music specializes in creeping guitar washes and slow drifts toward oblivion, there was no way for the California duo of Barn Owl to maintain the pace they once set. Between September 2009 and September 2011, multi-instrumental conjurers Evan Caminiti and Jon Porras released four full-length albums, each burrowing deeper into a mirage of droning desert blues. During that time, they also issued a brazen, roaring collaborative LP with Ellen Fullman, a composer who suspends wires in rooms to elicit extreme dynamics and radiating overtones. Porras and Caminiti stayed busy separately, too, pogoing between various boutique labels for solo records that pushed their group aesthetic to distinct extremes. Last year, they kept abreast of those individual paces, both releasing two fine LPs under their own names. But in 2012, there was no new Barn Owl material.The pause began after Lost in the Glare, a move that, in retrospect, seems like an optimal place for a Barn Owl semicolon. On those eight tracks, Caminiti and Porras’ intertwined guitars reached ideal levels of intensity and intimacy. On “Turiya”, featuring copacetic drummer Jacob Felix Heule, they let the tones bleed, playing their arid riffs with a force they’d never before managed. On “Light Echoes”, one of the prettiest pieces in the wide Barn Owl catalog, they repeated a trickling guitar line until it stretched into prismatic shimmer. Barn Owl had gotten very good at being itself.With Lost in the Glare, they also suggested they wanted to be something else. Aside from Heule, Barn Owl added bass clarinet, more percussion and, most presciently, an array of subtle synthesizer textures. So on V, Barn Owl’s proper fifth album, Caminiti and Porras return to the duo format to somewhat reinvent themselves, at least sonically. Though they both still list guitar as their primary instruments in the liner notes, the pair spend the bulk of V’s six tracks exploring keyboard drones, wide-set digital rhythms, kaleidoscopic synth hues, and barely there scrims of noise. The sustained electronics of “Blood Echo” reverberate as if from the mouth of a cave, with concussive thuds and streaks of sound suggesting the nascent work of European peers such as the Haxan Cloak and Raime. “Void Redux” seems like the hypothetical rendering of a session shared by Vangelis, Conrad Schnitzler, and Ennio Morricone; alternately, its dub inflections and colorful sprawl recall the more outer-atmosphere moments of Icon Give Thank, last year’s collaboration between the Congos, Sun Araw, and M. Geddes Gengras. “Against the Night” blooms like the best work of Tim Hecker, with sounds that float just past obvious perception suddenly rupturing into a euphoric rush."

Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of Tim Hecker, Christian Fennesz, or Yellow Swans should find entry points here, while the more minimal maneuvers of Thomas Köner and Keith Fullerton Whitman seem but a few slow steps away.

Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the final piece here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", O'Malley and Rehberg finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover.

In the mid-90s, Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green joined forces with sympathetic San Francisco souls Tim Soete and Josh Smith (who has been known to shred a few with über-black metal outfit Weakling), and immediately commenced to answer the question of what happens when you combine the strengths of Iron Maiden, Metallica and King Crimson and thrust that ornery beast upon indie rock audiences. The guys' first releases were independent cassettes, recorded as The Champs, which were available only at live shows. Soon after, they were pressured to change the bandname by the 60s group of the same name who'd had a hit with ""Tequila,"" so they opted instead to be known as C4AM95.C4AM95's first official full-length, the double-album III, hit stores in 1997 on Frenetic Records, and witnessed an already fully developed band at the height of their powers dropping not only mind-numbing cock-prog adventures, but also a few electronic vignettes that might not have sounded out of place on the Flash Gordon soundtrack. 2000's IV cut the length in half, but retained the concept entirely-- and it only won them more props.So, in the grand album tradition of Led Zeppelin and, well, Chicago, we now have V. The good news: nothing has changed; the bad news: uh, you like prog-metal, right? Hey, it could be worse (two words: Dream Theater). Besides, I defy anyone to find an ounce of pretension or bloated self-indulgence on this record. Wanky? Maybe, but probably less so than recent collaborators Trans Am, and anyway, the Fucking Champs own pretty much everyone in the super-rock department. There's a school of thought that says you have to make excuses for listening to stuff like this, but that kind of bullshit comes up limp in the face of the Champs' ability to ram a riff down your throat, not to mention their sheer sincerity.The two-part ""Never Enough Neck"" starts things off subtly, with a soft synth chord that crescendos into the crashing, distorted drums and guitars. They hit riffs one right after another, the tempo relentlessly quick and drummer Soete's dexterity stunning. The first part of the tune is fairly melodic, if full of typical Champs' crunch; the second switches up to a decidedly proggy tip, odd time signatures and all.The majestic (or as much as can be said of this band) ""Children Perceive the Hoax Cluster"" is actually a live track, replete with drunken screams and featuring Smith's considerable synthesizer atmospherics. The track forgoes percussive fury in lieu of pure 80s sci-fi mysticism (remember Ladyhawke?). This leads directly into another 80s trip, ""I Am the Album Cover,"" which is something like the shameful instrumental meeting of Iron Maiden and Survivor. To my ears, even though that kind of stuff might get the Champs' more press, I think it could potentially lead to novelty-band status. The track sounds like it may have been an old four-track experiment (the music on this disc dates as far back as '93), so maybe they're focusing on a more idiosyncratic sound now.The best tracks on V are the ones that throw caution and 80s kitsch out the window in favor of chops-ahoy-- like the up-tempo ""Happy Segovia,"" or the epic ""Aliens of Gold,"" which may be the best-ever example of trying to fuse the words 'prog' and 'metal,' while never uttering the word 'sux.' And yes, there is a metal version of a Bach tune here (\xA91723, so say the liner notes), so I suppose even the Fucking Champs aren't above the occasional Spinal Tap move. But you know, it fits right in with the other stuff. So I guess the moral is that if a band is good enough, plays hard enough, and does it without the slightest hint of irony, they can find people who'll love them regardless of the genre. Either that, or resurrecting the ghost of Randy Rhoads is the magic formula for making cool records. What do you think?"

It was the pop star’s beginning of a transition away from Disney incorruptibility towards songwriting that better represented the crossroads at which she found herself. Unlike the overproduced electropop of her 2013 debut, Stars Dance, Revival reflected her expanding sexuality, power, and interest in telling her own stories; Gomez actualized these objectives by posing nearly nude on the album cover, serving among its executive producers, and working with specific songwriters to help translate her experiences. As she proclaimed on the title track, it was her “time to butterfly.”Over the next five years, Gomez’s journey towards emancipation would be challenged by serious struggles with anxiety, depression, and chronic illness that sidelined her music career and threatened her life. But in 2017, the same year she underwent a risky kidney transplant due to complications from the autoimmune disease lupus, Gomez shared a series of genre-curious singles including the Talking Heads-sampling “Bad Liar.” After checking the cultural pulse, the then most-followed woman on Instagram logged off, removing herself from the public eye once more. Besides popping up for the occasional movie role or fashion collaboration, Gomez focused on herself. “I just needed to let my old self go,” Gomez told Zane Lowe this month.When Gomez shared the ballad “Lose You to Love Me” last fall, it seemed like the work she put into her physical and emotional wellness had clicked. The song looks at the ways she lost herself in a relationship and solemnly promises to never make that mistake again. While dropping hints at which supposedly “Sorry” singer had been dragging her down, Gomez reclaimed her own narrative. Her anguished soul-searching struck a nerve: “Lose You to Love Me” became Gomez’s first Billboard No. 1. Though the song’s drama is an exception, its moral of losing love and gaining self is the guiding ethos of her third record, Rare. While none of these 13 songs attempt the subtle weirdness of “Bad Liar” and the emotional thesis—self-love!—can be a bit one-note, Rare is the 27-year-old’s most cohesive record to date. It feels spiritually in tune with the woman who once cheerfully told Vogue that people would be surprised to learn how much she loves “depressing things.”But Rare’s celebration of autonomy, resilience, and growth is overwhelmingly upbeat. After waving goodbye to a lover who does not respect her worth on the blissed-out self-titled opener, Gomez cleanses her heart with an electro-pop party on “Dance Again.” Dancing through pain is by now a tried-and-true motif in pop music, but the sentiment holds extra weight for Gomez, who undoubtedly knows from her lupus how it feels to be powerless over your body. But Rare doesn’t dwell on heavy realities like chronic illness or the ice-cold grip of depression or, really, any sadness lingering after heartache. When Gomez looks back on toxic relationships wracked with mistrust or self-sabotaging anxiety spirals, her perspective is more grateful than regretful, as if to say that everything in life is a valuable lesson."

Rather than weakness to be purged, Wollen sees a sturdy foundation for collective action. “Feminism should acknowledge that being a girl in this world is really hard, one of the hardest things there is,” Wollen said, in a 2015 interview. “Our sadness is actually a very appropriate and informed reaction.”Something of Wollen’s principles surface in Late Night Feelings, a collection of 13 songs produced by Mark Ronson and performed and co-written by a suite of female vocalists. Ronson has described these tunes as “sad bangers;” contributor Camila Cabello called them “emo bops sung by girls about love and heartbreak.” And while the prevailing mood is, indeed, sadness, the record makes for a finely shaded portrayal of that feeling. In a pop landscape at present awash in sad girls, Late Night Feelings lands several notches below the profundity of Lorde’s feral manifesto and several notches above Bebe Rexha’s disjointed smash of yesteryear, “I’m A Mess.” Never nihilistic, never narcissistic, the women of Late Night Feelings understand sadness as a vital conduit for solidarity and self-expression.It’s not a knock on Ronson to say that the project succeeds, in large part, because of how little it sounds like his work. His distinctive production hallmarks—the neo-soul of Amy Winehouse, the sticky bounce of “Uptown Funk”—are largely absent, save for brief, restrained doses. The women on this record are diverse in terms of race and orientation, their target audiences, and their places in the music industry. For the most part, Ronson seems content to remain seated at the boards, allowing the unique strengths of each vocalist to inform the music.A long stretch of the album is commanded by YEBBA, who proves conclusively, across three tracks, that she has the range, darling. Her daring vocals leap from near-Joanna Newsom falsetto to sultry, guttural contralto. Her delivery defies convention, particularly on “When U Went Away,” where she makes a glorious, expressive meal of a lyric as simple as “I’m gonna be alright.” Another highlight is “Why Hide,” an understated ballad from tremendous talent Diana Gordon. Gordon, a Beyoncé co-writer whose 2011 debut album as Wynter Gordon flew under the public radar, has been waiting and working for a breakthrough for a number of years. May this track be her first step toward ubiquity."

Pure Heroine is a collection of throbbing, moody, menacingly anesthetized pop.","In the current pop firmament, Lorde is a black hole. That’s the message you get from the defiantly low-concept video for her single “Tennis Court,” in which the 16 year-old New Zealand singer-songwriter (real name: Ella Yelich-O’Connor) stares right at you—her taunting, onyx pupils burning a hole through the computer screen—for a hypnotic and somewhat uncomfortable three and a half minutes. (I’'s an anti-video in the tradition of the Replacements’ “Bastards of Young,” and, fittingly, her moody cover of “Swingin Party” has been making the rounds.) In a moment when too many new artists seem afraid to offend or go off script, Lorde is an exciting contradiction: an aspiring pop star who’s had a major-label development deal since age 12 (she was discovered at a local talent show) but has retained a seemingly genuine iconoclastic streak. The other day she spoke too truthfully in an interview and accidentally insulted Taylor Swift; Katy Perry asked her to tour with her and—politely but firmly—she said no. With the global smash “Royals” (the first song in 17 years by a female solo artist to top Billboard’s alternative chart) she made her name by sneering at everything else on the radio (“We don’t care/We aren’t caught up in your love affair”). The message is clear: Lorde has introduced herself to the world as someone who gives very few fucks. Twenty seconds into her debut album, Pure Heroine, she’s already announced that she’s bored. Twice.Lorde’s voice occasionally takes the form of a wide-eyed, Feist-y coo, but much more often it’s a low, clenched growl; like everything else about her, it has an air of “wise beyond her years.” “I didn’t start writing songs until I was 13,” she said in a recent interview, almost apologetically, but then quickly accounted for the lost time, “Before that, I wrote short fiction.” Now that she’s a wizened 16, Lorde, who wrote all the lyrics on Pure Heroine and co-wrote the music, has fashioned herself a correspondent on the front lines of elegantly wasted post-digital youth culture and working-class suburban boredom. Her songs capture the drama and debauched regality of being a teenager: Their subjects include online gossip, empty bottles, queen bees, and young people who already feel old. “I’m kinda older than I was when I rebelled without a care,” she sings with a languid sigh on the bleacher-stomping single “Team.” Or is she saying “revelled”? It’s hard to tell the two words apart, and maybe that’s the point."

Without producer Robin Hannibal, who fleshed out the group’s 2013 debut with minimalist, sumptuous production, Milosh leaned on beefier instrumentation and overstated lyrics that sapped most of the enigmatic, economical appeal from their music. Rhye’s new EP Spirit, recorded after an extensive tour last summer, feels like a loose, low-stakes companion to Blood. Rhye’s usual electronic and guitar stylings are stripped back to meditative piano arrangements and ambient mood-setting, making for an effective if lightweight backdrop for his sighing variety of romance.Milosh put Spirit together after being gifted a baby grand piano by his girlfriend, using daily exercises as a form of meditation following a draining tour schedule. The brief eight-song album reflects that sense of introspection and ritualistic quiet, with most songs resting in minor key and Milosh’s hazy timbre offering up long, wordless hums. Rhye has used chamber music as an indirect influence in the past, whether stacking harmonies over a horn section on “Woman” or adding plucked strings to their cover of Procol Harum’s “A Whiter Shade of Pale.” But here Milosh mostly dresses things down to an intentionally spare, percussive base; his piano is close-mic’d alongside the slightest brushes of synths and strings, signaling intimacy without the heavy-handedness that dragged down Blood.Lyrically, Milosh remains exclusively concerned with a tortured type of desire: He wants to be needed, feel your pain, wage your wars, et cetera. Delivered in a smooth, unified whisper, the words of affection sometimes sound vaguely sinister rather than sexy, as on “Needed,” written and produced with former Semisonic singer Dan Wilson: “Why you look so fragile? Do I seem so bad?/Oh, you look so pretty, there’s no devils here.” The song hinges on even clumsier phrasing during its chorus (“I wanna be needed, that’s what I need”) that undercuts all the feverish desire lurking at its core. Elsewhere, Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds adds his minimalist touch to the simmering, hymn-like standout “Patience,” while Milosh lets his piano do the legwork on muted instrumental trifles “Malibu Nights” and “Green Eyes.” It all feels a little perfunctory for Rhye at this point, but in a characteristically refined way that at least makes for easy casual listening.Spirit boils down the seductive essence of Rhye’s music to core elements. It would do well as an introduction to the group for an unfamiliar listener, but doesn’t feel necessary by any means. If anything, Spirit comes across as more mood music by design, bespoke and undemanding, and it probably already has real estate on every bedroom-themed playlist on Spotify. Rhye is now a reliably polished provider of this style of music, but it’s a position that clearly doesn’t allow for very many risks."

Over solemn piano chords and a lockstep electro groove that hints at the cadence of a protest march, Gahan laments how “we feel nothing inside” as we “track it all with satellites” and “watch men die in real time.” By track two, “Where’s the Revolution,” Gahan begins calling for out-and-out revolt, chiding the audience: “Come on people/You’re letting me down.” In his golden-throated baritone, Gahan reminds us that we’ve been “pissed on/For too long,” our “rights abused” by governments who “Manipulate and threaten/With terror as a weapon.”Apparently, principal lyricist and songwriter Martin Gore is no longer content to focus all his attention on the spiritual searching that has defined Depeche Mode’s music for more than 30 years. Over that time, few artists have so artfully portrayed the inner dialogue between redemption and indulgence. By the band’s 1990 breakout Violator, Gore had basically invented his own syntax for the human condition as a purgatorial struggle between sinful pleasures and a yearning for higher peace. And Gahan, with his ability to invest urgency, soul, and a feeling of debauched weariness into subjects like S&M and tortured love, has never failed to translate Gore’s restless malaise to the throngs who fill stadiums to connect with it. Gahan turns despair into sex appeal unlike no other. But this time, he’s tasked with looking up from his satin, regret-stained sheets and making us believe that an aging rock star really cares about civil unrest.Gahan delivers Gore’s state-of-world address for three songs in a row before going back to the band’s bread-and-butter obsessions. Later, though, on “Poorman”—which self-consciously references the spartan electronic gurgle of the Violator hit “Policy of Truth”—Gore and Gahan risk coming off as oblivious to the irony when they observe that “corporations get the breaks/Keeping almost everything they make” and ask, “When will it trickle down?” But Depeche Mode deliver anthems with such proficiency that sincerity barely matters. A song like “Where’s the Revolution” makes you feel like singing in response to today’s headlines. Depeche Mode still make universal, stadium-sized music that’s limber enough to fit through your bedroom doorframe, as if it had been conceived with your life in mind.In some respects, though, their consistency works against them. The sixth album since the departure of multi-instrumentalist/arranger Alan Wilder, Spirit sees Depeche Mode once again shuffling through the most quintessential components of their sound. On “Cover Me,” Gore’s haunting Lanois-esque guitar twang allows you to close your eyes and picture yourself under the Northern lights Gahan sings about. But aside from “Cover Me,” Spirit lacks the ambience of Depeche Mode’s most atmospheric material. If only producer/mixer James Ford (Florence and the Machine, Foals, Arctic Monkeys) had disheveled the sounds a bit, Spirit could have better asserted its place in Depeche Mode’s body of work.Instead, Ford—who is also one half of the electronic duo Simian Mobile Disco—mimics the vibe of the band’s iconic work with producer Flood. But even Flood didn’t imitate himself when he mixed the last DM album, 2013’s far more creatively resolute Delta Machine. Nevertheless, this is a band whose effortlessness can misguide you into thinking they’re not trying. Don’t be fooled. In the bridge of “Where’s the Revolution,” Gahan repeats the line “the train is coming, the train is coming... get on board.” You can draw inspiration from that lyric whether or not you take to the streets or petition your elected officials. Gore’s directive is less about activism and more about opening your heart so that it guides your conscience. For him, the term “spirit” has come to encompass politics, but it’s fueled by the same eros that’s driven the band’s music since day one. Which is why Spirit is so convincing in spite of its radical shift in tenor. For both the band and audience, that shift couldn’t have come at a better time."

Even calling them post-rock isn't a perfect fit; after all, the album does have vocals, as sparingly used as they may be. Now reissued by ATP Recordings two years after its original release on Acuarela Discos, Spirit is a moody and mostly instrumental affair, but it's strikingly different than any similar act running today; this is something much more haunted and sparse. Many songs are dominated more by the echo of a piano key or the warm hum after a guitar string settles than the notes themselves.Deliberate one-note bass and steady horse-clop drumming leads a floating sing-song vocal on ""From the North"", sounding not just ""cinematic"" and sweeping, but dreamlike. The vocals here are breathy, high, and nearly ghostlike, used as just another texture among many. The eventual crescendo isn't uncommon among Apse's peers, and while they do raise the volume and the distortion here, the buildup might be the more captivating part. Even when thrashing away, they seem to know the value of open space, and they know when enough is enough, cutting their well-earned climax surprisingly short.""Legions"" is bult on a music-box melody, muffled and faint just below the exchange between the rhythm section and a once-strummed chord. The rhythm suddenly becomes much more discernible and urgent, and a voice kicks in, singing a mantra for more material issues (""We love our lovers, but we want to be loved by another."") From there, they veer back and forth between rollicking and atmospheric, using their quickly mutating composition to stretch out the tension.""Shade of the Moor"" and especially ""The Crowned"" have lyrics that demand more attention without stealing the focus, and ""Crowned"" is where the tribal rhythms of the album really start to take shape. This continues later with ""Ark"", with pounding, primal drums that eventually recede into ominous radio static. ""Wind Through the Walls"" brings the record into haunted-house territory, courtesy of piano and layered vocals through chamber-of-souls-level echo, and even the quiet, tiptoeing rhythm of ""Blackwood Gates"" sounds vaguely threatening, as does the forebodingly slow closer of the title track.But whether it's a séance or a sacrifice they're conjuring, the tone and feel of the record stays uniform, for better or for worse. What could be a consistent sound and mood for some may be an endless revision of one song for others. Either way, it's the band's grasp of tension and space that makes Spirit a distinctive and not-so-easily-bracketed album. Its big crescendos feel paranoid and desperate, its slower moments vibrate with danger, and its creeps are subtle but visceral."

Instead, the ranks were populated by guys like Peter Gabriel, George Michael, and Hall & Oates, who sang forcefully and made bold pop hits with intelligent, grown-up themes. Artists who also had broad sonic appetites and arty predilections, guaranteeing their work would sometimes frustrate, but would remain intriguing.On his last solo album, 2006's Like Drawing Blood, Gotye achieved the abstraction and restlessness of good art-pop, but failed to bring enough actual pop to the equation. The album was an inspired, dense blend of globe-spanning sounds, yet it meandered far too frequently. Many of the songs stretched between five and seven minutes long, and found him stitching together multiple sounds and ideas at the detriment of shape or focus, eschewing pop's vital sense of urgency. Fortunately, with his newest release, Making Mirrors, Gotye has figured out how to remain sonically voracious while still giving his listeners a sturdy foothold. He finds room here for psych-rock, soul, earnest balladeering, creepy retro-futurism, electronic and Tropicalia touches, and, yes, scads of serious-minded 1980s pop. It's in that last category that most of album's best moments reside. Without ever settling in one spot too slavishly or lengthily to come off like a mere imitator, Gotye deploys his sincere, powerfully expressive voice (under-utilized on Like Drawing Blood) in evoking those bombastic 80s pop architects referenced above. ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" and ""Eyes Wide Open"" dramatically convey the acrimony and finality of a shattered relationship, while ""In Your Light"" and ""Save Me"" offer up the redemptive side of the coin.These declamatory studio-pop moves don't just represent many of Making Mirrors' highlights; their shared style and tone also really helps hold the album together, compensating for Gotye's scattershot attention span elsewhere. Admittedly, some of these one-offs are very good – the Cee-Lo/Jamie Lidell-approved retro-soul of ""I Feel Better"" is the kind of thing that actually works far better as an isolated detour than an organizing principle. The same is true for the guileless ""Giving Me a Chance"" (which somehow manages to favorably evoke Travis) and the ""Drive My Car""-styled acid-rock blast ""Easy Way Out"". Only occasionally does Gotye wander too far off the reservation, but by that point he's earned his quirks, and so the bizarrely pitch-shifted, suburbia-tech nightmare ""State of the Art"" and eerily whispered, Reznor-ish ""Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You"" feel more like an endearingly loopy sidebars than self-indulgent, momentum-derailing bores. Gotye's exemplary pop sense may be the big revelation of Making Mirrors, yet it's his arty restlessness that will continue to keep him interesting."

But repeated listens to the 23-year-old New York rapper’s Arcade reveal the intricacy and subtleties of Jones—he’s not the earnest pup sniffing around your ankles, but a fully formed personality, an approachable everyman rapper who’s more Oddisee and Open Mike Eagle than Vic Mensa.Jones’ persona is enriched by a deep love of old funk and soul music (his father Curtis played guitar for the influential band Slave), and he frequently uses live instrumentation. “Grass (Survivor’s Guilt)” transitions from light adult-contemporary guitar to thudding boom-bap, mashing together conflicting thoughts in the same way Jones weaves a love song into a thought about romance as a “great distraction from checking the evening news and staying up on what’s happening.”“Tropicana” occupies the same fleet-footed space as other intoxicating, breezy singles from this year, like Joey Purp’s “Girls @” and Amine’s “Caroline.” But Jones manages to weave details and asides in the lyrics that require repeated, close listens (it also proves he’s more than capable of double-time raps and old-school flows). “He killing but you still say, ‘free my bro,’ truth be told he should do his time/but hey that’s another song,” he offers casually, hinting at a larger world than he has time to get to inside a two-and-a-half minute toe-tapper. It’s a reminder of the potency that a flighty, sub-three minute rap song can contain, and the depths rap often plunders through beats that fill floors with joyous dancing bodies.Jones is also an excellent hook writer, transforming the fantasy of the funky “Powerball” with a gospel-hued, reality-crashing bridge of: “What’s going on/nothing but the rent, nothing but the rent, nothing but the rent.” The song's cheeky “what if I won the lottery” concept is fleshed out by his chuckling reminiscence: “I graduated all they gave me was a piece of paper/no ‘good job’/no goodbye/not even ‘see you later.’” The humanity of the moment is telling: How else could you expect to “move up” in life without the aide of the lotto, while dealing with the quotidian reality that education rarely provides a pragmatic leg-up?The piano ballad “Untitled” showcases his soulful voice, framing the song as a declaration to his mother he’s moving out while sneaking a tender autobiography. He calls back to this “hidden track” a few songs later, trading the piano for guitar (again, no drums) and offering a few more personal details: “My prom date just got engaged, I’m happy for you Marissa/that night in June I was probably just too nervous to kiss you,” he sighs, seconds after noting the colors of his childhood home were painted as the house gets put on the market. These moments are affecting because they are the work of an empathetic writer—he gives everyone in his stories autonomy: Jones has searched himself for the story and held onto the moments he thinks matter, not merely assumed he is the story. With Arcade, he makes you a part of the story, too."

It lives in suspended animation, always excited for the weekend, never clocking into work. Katy Perry’s second album is ostentatious, off-color, fearlessly optimistic even when the music isn’t great. It is forever young, but—as teenagers often do—still loudly announces its age. And it was a smash: Its five No. 1 hits tied a record set by Michael Jackson’s 1987 album Bad. Half of the tracklist went Top 10. Teenage Dream was the last gasp for guitar-powered bubblegum; the following year, Adele’s 21 would shatter sales records and kick off a moody new era in pop. To look back on it now is to realize just how fast it all changed.Teenage Dream’s subject, like the subject of young life broadly speaking, is love. Some of the album was supposedly written about men from Perry’s own life, including then-fiancé Russell Brand (“Hummingbird Heartbeat,” “Not Like the Movies”), Gym Class Heroes’ Travie McCoy (“Circle the Drain”), and nice boy Josh Groban (“The One That Got Away”). But the appellations might as well have been added after the fact; these songs aren’t confessionals, they’re two-ingredient cocktails, party-starters just waiting for you to arrive. Teenage Dream boasts some of the stronger writing in Perry’s catalog, maybe because she hadn’t yet had time to repeat herself. And even then: There are two hurricanes, one representing the passion of youth and another followed by a rainbow, and then there’s another rainbow, except this one ends in a giant penis.If Perry seems like she’s really trying, it’s because she was an unlikely success. She grew up in Santa Barbara, California, the middle child of Pentecostal preachers who sent her to private religious schools. She dropped out after freshman year and released her first music, as Katy Hudson, on a small Nashville Christian label. Her eventual pivot to Katy Perry, flirtatious and foul-mouthed pop star, made for a contrast as bold as her outfits, and she had to try the whole time: years in major-label purgatory, entering and exiting contracts with Def Jam and then Columbia with no album, no single, nothing except a soundtrack cut for The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. She worked for a time critiquing other singers’ demo submissions at a small label outside Los Angeles. It was, she remembered later, “the worst music you’ve ever heard in your entire life. … I wanted to jump out of the building or cut my ears off and say, ‘I can’t help you! I can’t catch a break. What am I gonna say to you? And you sing off tune.’”"
30FURVTCpbKyykjSEQzGkH,0.725,123.28,0.49,pop,-3.304,0.0983,0.335,Amy Winehouse,4.0,0.0392,70,back to black,Soft Pop Hits,Back To Black,2.68e-05,1.0,10.0,0.123,soft,6.4,,"""They tried to make me go to rehab,"" wails Amy Winehouse on the opening track and first single from her second album Back to Black. It's not typical pop song fodder, but Winehouse isn't a typical pop singer. If she winds up as popular in the U.S. as she is at home in the UK, it'll be despite her reluctance to embrace the monotonous realities of promotional mechanics. Oh, she'll talk, but there's no guarantee what she'll say. (Our favorite is her heckling of Bono at last year's Q Awards: ""Shut up, I don't give a fuck!"") She'll be scheduled to perform, but there's no guarantee what she'll do, or even if she'll make it through the show. And she'll sing about her problems, but she won't give a shit what you think of them.If this makes Winehouse read a little like Lily Allen, that's not far off the mark. Both are larger-than-life singers who've found perfect vehicles for their outsized personalities. In Allen's case, it's a cocktail of pop, reggae, and hip-hop, with a cigarette in hand; for Winehouse, it's soul, jazz, and blues with a bottle of booze. Both pay tribute to their influences, with Winehouse's lyrics featuring shout-outs to Ray Charles, Donny Hathaway, and Slick Rick, and the two even share a producer: Mark Ronson, who's also worked with everyone from Sean Paul and Macy Gray to Ghostface and Rhymefest.But Winehouse is anything but a Lily Allen doppelgänger. After all, soul and jazz music are typically considered the province of grownups, and while Winehouse could be accused of slipping on these styles like costumes, she imbues her music with a surprisingly genuine soulfulness.Ronson's sneaky production provides most of the album's wit: The old school backdrop to ""Me & Mr. Jones"" is especially winking against couplets like ""What kind of fuckery is this? You made me miss the Slick Rick gig."" But Winehouse's zingers (in that same song she tells her subject ""'side from Sammy you're my best black Jew"") and profane interjections (the title track begins ""He left no time to regret/ Kept his dick wet"") are only an occasional thing as she travels a well-worn lyrical path to both clinical and romantic rehabilitation.Songs like ""Love Is a Losing Game"" are full of regret, even if Winehouse refuses to wallow entirely in self-pity. However, as one might expect following the declaration of ""Rehab"", Winehouse does spend much of Back to Black on the defensive, trying to explain why she's stayed with the same guy who's done her wrong, or, in the case of ""Wake Up Alone"", why her ex gives her the night sweats (""I drip for him tonight,"" Winehouse less delicately puts it).It's one of the eternal themes of soul music, here spiced up with post-modern production where less forceful personalities might have gone with strictly retro emulation. The references to girl groups, northern soul, and ska are there, but no one would confuse these approximations (split evenly between Ronson and Salaam Remi, who produced Winehouse's since-disowned debut) with the real thing.Fortunately, Winehouse has been blessed by a brassy voice that can transform even mundane sentiments into powerful statements. She may be heartbroken, but she uses that ache, twisting the emotional scars to suit her songs-- and if she often seems like the masochistic recipient of each knife twist, so be it. It's not until the album's final track, ""He Can Only Hold Her"", that Winehouse finally switches from first person to third, the ""I""s and ""me""s giving way to ""he""s and ""she""s, suggesting that she's finally become an objective observer, able to see her personal issues for what they are. ""He tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside never dies,"" she sings, and we can only assume from this new vantage that Winehouse has moved on."

Aside from a few cynical words for pre-nups in opener ""Options"" and not one, but three meditations on extramarital sex (thanks for sharing, Dave), the album is padded with typical Pedro ruminations on the pitfalls of vanity and technology.Unlike our esteemed colleague DiCrescenzo, I enjoyed Winners Never Quit, with its thoughtful and highly personal themes of loss, regret, and competition. But where that album moved with confidence and conviction of purpose, Control wallows in an amoral netherworld of overamped midtempo ballads and incomplete thoughts.Control's lack of focus is best exemplified by ""Indian Summer,"" a synthy rocker peppered with rhyming non-sequiturs such as, ""The experts say you ought to start them young/ That way they'll naturally love the taste of corporate cum."" A sluggish, vocoder-treated new recording of ""April 6, 2039"" (now titled ""Progress"") does little but detract from the spacey, drum-machine propelled futurism of the original. With its refrain of ""your father drank a little, you're on liver number two,"" Bazan's cautionary words of children spoiled by technology and their parents' emotional detachment should be Control's moral centerpiece, yet the lackluster reading here barely registers.Instead, Bazan obsesses on the seedy details of his protagonists' motel-room infidelities. ""The mattress creaks beneath the symphony of misery and cum,"" Bazan sings on the aggressive, voyeuristic ""Second Best."" ""Still we lie jerking back and forth, and blurring into one."" But Control is never more misguided than on the silly, Metaphor 101 observations of ""Rapture,"" which cheaply likens the moment of orgasm to divine revelation and even slows the pace of the song down, post-coitally, before pepping back up again.Musically, Control breaks little new ground for Pedro the Lion, though Bazan's drumming has improved greatly since Winners Never Quit, best showcased in the loping rhythms and artfully executed fills of ""Magazine."" Unfortunately, Bazan goes on to illustrate why you should never let a drummer mix his own record on the next cut, ""Rehearsal,"" with some of the hammiest fills since Wayne's World's Garth drummed for U2 and a headache-inducing barrage of overdriven cymbals. Somebody send Bazan a copy of The Soft Bulletin, pronto!Not that Control doesn't have its moments: ""Penetration,"" co-written with Seldom's Casey Foubert, is a reasonably cathartic requiem for a dotcom layoff, with chiming, Edge-like guitars and a brash, anthemic chorus. Lines like, ""We're so sorry, sir, but you did not quite make the cut this time,"" will ring sympathetically with anyone who's ever been passed over as casually as a grade-school snot picking teams for dodgeball. ""Priests and Paramedics,"" rising majestically from the overkill of ""Second Best,"" is elevated by a lovely, Thom Yorke-ish melody custom made for Bazan's stoned tenor. It's not hard to imagine its tired protagonist stepping out of Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead and onto the murder scene of Winners's ""Never Leave a Job Half Done."" The song's evocative imagery and fetching arrangement deserve a better concept album than the jumbled pastiche of Control.Even Bazan's occasionally astute observations are offset by such poetry-contest entries as, ""It will never rain again/ It should do wonders for the GNP,"" and, ""How does that work for you in your quest to be above reproach?"" Or the half-baked philosophy of the dead-on-arrival album closer, ""Rejoice"": ""Wouldn't it be so wonderful if everything were meaningless?"" Oh, honestly, Dave.It would be easy to dismiss Control as a pompous, self-important failure were Bazan a vain and sanctimonious artist. But he's not-- he seems like a soft-spoken, thoughtful, nice-enough guy just like you and me. And while he may never make his own OK Computer or Soft Bulletin or whatever he set out to make with Control, I won't dock him points for trying."

On its uninspired follow-up, Starboy, he seems to lose sight of that vision almost entirely.","Who is the Weeknd? That’s the question a lot of us asked when the act first materialized, fully-formed, with 2011’s House of Balloons. Thanks to the group’s savvy anti-publicity campaign, the question had a literal bent: who are the people who made these songs? Fast-forward five years and there’s little mystery remaining when it comes to the provenance of the Weeknd’s music—like so many modern pop songs, his are now designed in consultation with a committee of experts. And yet, even as we watch Abel Tesfaye walk the red carpet in the light of day, the question remains: Who is the Weeknd? Is he a drugged-out lothario? A beloved pop star? A nihilist foil to Drake? The second coming of Michael Jackson? The runaway success of last years’ Beauty Behind the Madness—two No. 1 singles and over two million units sold in the U.S.—seemed like it might finally force an answer to this question. And yet, Starboy, the Weeknd’s sixth overall album and third for a major label, only further muddies the waters.Initially, there were signs that Starboy would represent a much-needed pivot, a rethinking of a sound and image that seemed to have run its course, from DIY mixtapes to the top of the charts. The album’s lead video features Tesfaye murdering a past version of himself before taking a cross-shaped bat to a condo full of awards and sales plaques. Starboy, however, is hardly a dramatic reinvention—if anything, it feels like a watered-down retread of the same old tropes. Beauty Behind the Madness managed to smuggle sleaze into the mainstream by refining Tesfaye’s pop songcraft, even as it doubled down on the darkness. Starboy eases up on both fronts, recycling melodies, ideas, and even whole songs while presenting a sanitized version of the Weeknd that often lacks any real sense of perspective. It’s a curious move for a guy who so decisively managed to succeed on his own terms.As if to guarantee that it feels like a slog, Starboy is also overstuffed: over an hour of music stretching out over 18 songs, many of them bland. “Rockin’” sounds like a label executive’s idea of what the Weeknd could be: inoffensive club pop tailor-made for office karaoke parties (“I just want your body next to me/’Cause it brings me so much ecstasy/We can just be rockin’, yeah”). “False Alarm” snatches defeat from the jaws of victory, its sublime opening harmonies devolving into a screamed chorus that’s as contrived as Michael Jackson’s bellow at the beginning of “Scream.” “Six Feet Under,” a collaboration with Future, is essentially just a rewrite of the pair's much sharper “Low Life” (“Reminder” also recycles the vocal melody from “Low Life”); both here and on “All I Know,” the melodically-gifted rapper feels sorely underutilized. Kendrick Lamar’s verse on the autotune-heavy “Sidewalks” is characteristically dexterous but even he sounds a bit unenthused to be here. It’s hard to blame him."

Violens' 2010 debut, Amoral, ditched the shadows and fog for pop-rock bounce and Boo Radleys impressions that were impressively faithful, if not totally memorable. For the band's follow-up, True, they've moved to perpetually in-vogue indie pop revivalist mecca Slumberland. In general, Elbrecht and his latest project haven't strayed too far from the same sonic mission announced circa L-D's excellent The Dividing Island cut ""Two Extremes"": All sonic roads still end shortly before Bill Clinton first took residence in the White House, the previous Echo and the Bunnymen comparisons joined here by takes on the jangly roar of first-wave shoegazers like Pale Saints, Slowdive, and Ride.Those slight changes in genre-based sound are the results of True being Violens' first true full-band effort, as the record's writing sessions began while the band's current lineup was touring behind Amoral. This turns out to be a boon, since True sounds more melodically pretty and dewy-eyed than its predecessor. If you're the ceiling-staring type that gets chills from just a few seconds of chiming guitar, or maybe a snatch of achingly sung vocals, this record might be just your thing. Undoubtedly, these simple pleasures seem all the more pleasurable because the bar's been lowered over the past few years when it comes to ""this kind of stuff,"" which gives True a whiff of ephemerality; on the other hand, ""enjoy it while you can"" doesn't seem like particularly terrible advice as long as you can, well, enjoy it.When I say ""this kind of stuff,"" I'm referring to the current and ongoing guitar-indie embrace of shoegaze-derived texture and feel, which wasn't very present in the sparkling clarity that Amoral wore like the prettiest nail polish. On True, that's been replaced by the kind of production touches you'd expect from a Slumberland release-- reverb, distanced vocals, guitars coated in a warm glow. Over the past few years, those things have become synonymous with representing guitar-focused indie music that's tagged as ""lo-fi,"" but there's not much about True that sounds home-recorded or shabby. As he did on Amoral, Elbrecht handled the production duties on True, and his able ear makes True less a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP and more of a studio professional's idea of what a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP would sound like. It's the small details, like the howling wind and bird cries that open ""Sariza Spring"" or the exquisitely applied layers of echo on closer ""So Hard to See"", that mark this album as a headphones listen.Here's why I hold some reservation against Violens: True shows that Elbrecht and his band are more than capable of recreating moments from the past in a way that is reverent and still provides pleasure to those who grew up listening to those past sounds and relative newbies alike. But I'm not so sure that they're good at doing much more than that. Violens seem to have hit their sweet spot here, though, so hopefully they'll continue drilling in the same place instead of looking for more history that's ripe for plundering."

Undoubtedly, these simple pleasures seem all the more pleasurable because the bar's been lowered over the past few years when it comes to ""this kind of stuff,"" which gives True a whiff of ephemerality; on the other hand, ""enjoy it while you can"" doesn't seem like particularly terrible advice as long as you can, well, enjoy it.When I say ""this kind of stuff,"" I'm referring to the current and ongoing guitar-indie embrace of shoegaze-derived texture and feel, which wasn't very present in the sparkling clarity that Amoral wore like the prettiest nail polish. On True, that's been replaced by the kind of production touches you'd expect from a Slumberland release-- reverb, distanced vocals, guitars coated in a warm glow. Over the past few years, those things have become synonymous with representing guitar-focused indie music that's tagged as ""lo-fi,"" but there's not much about True that sounds home-recorded or shabby. As he did on Amoral, Elbrecht handled the production duties on True, and his able ear makes True less a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP and more of a studio professional's idea of what a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP would sound like. It's the small details, like the howling wind and bird cries that open ""Sariza Spring"" or the exquisitely applied layers of echo on closer ""So Hard to See"", that mark this album as a headphones listen.Here's why I hold some reservation against Violens: True shows that Elbrecht and his band are more than capable of recreating moments from the past in a way that is reverent and still provides pleasure to those who grew up listening to those past sounds and relative newbies alike. But I'm not so sure that they're good at doing much more than that. Violens seem to have hit their sweet spot here, though, so hopefully they'll continue drilling in the same place instead of looking for more history that's ripe for plundering."

Joe Strummer loved ABBA. Pete Townshend really loved ABBA. As a five year-old boy on a Welsh council estate in 1977, I loved ABBA. My mum and dad loved ABBA. If ever I went round to a friend’s house whose parents had a record player in the living room, you could count on there being an ABBA LP leaning in the Formica cabinet beside it. Everyone, so it seemed in my five year-old’s perspective of the universe, loved ABBA.The four Swedes—two couples, Agnetha and Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid (aka “Frida”)—first invaded British shores in 1974 at the Eurovision Song Contest in Brighton with their winning entry, “Waterloo”; the United Kingdom awarded ABBA “nil points” on the night, making their subsequent domination of our charts one of the sweetest revenges outside the pages of The Count Of Monte Cristo. They properly conquered in 1976 with their Greatest Hits, the year’s biggest-selling album and the second biggest-selling album in Britain of the 1970s (beaten by Simon & Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water which had the advantage of a six-year head start). The same year saw a triptych of UK number ones: “Money, Money, Money,” “Fernando,” and the unstoppable “Dancing Queen,” which sold over a million copies and spent six solid weeks at the top. That the latter’s parent album, Arrival released in October 1976, should consolidate their stronghold was a fait accompli. By 1977 ABBA were unshiftable, omnipresent and commercially invincible.Arrival was their fourth studio album but the first to forge an identity in tandem with its introduction of their soon-to-be iconic trademark reversed B logo. Its three predecessors—1973’s Ring Ring, 1974’s Waterloo, and 1975’s ABBA—had been a series of costume-changing forays and false-starts through folk-rock, glam, light ballads, and novelty rock‘n’roll. Nobody yet regarded ABBA as an albums band until the million-selling phenomenon of 1976’s Greatest Hits propelled them to the forefront of the market. An intriguingly-misnamed 15 track compilation from an act who’d so far made the UK singles charts just five times, to British audiences Greatest Hits acted as ABBA’s equivalent to a debut album, its success highlighting a major transformative shift: from the bedroom turntable at 45 rpm to the family stereo at 33 1/3. ABBA could never have succeeded as a teen pop act alone. The coup of Greatest Hits owed much to its appeal to the same age group as seen on its cover: four adults sat on a park bench in contrastingly coupled yin and yang of romantic bliss and collapse."

And Magoo.  : /","When it comes down to the big three producer-MCs who have defined club-friendly rap over the past decade-- Diddy, Pharrell and Timbaland-- Tim's the one who's been best able to rein in his self-indulgent tendencies. He hasn't spent more time being a pop icon than a musician, hasn't suffered from any major dry spells of creative entropy and, most importantly, has known enough to let his beats do most of the heavy lifting. This might be one of the reasons he's considered by most trainspotter pop fiends to be more of a genius than those other two; even when Tim runs his mouth, it's typically been innocuously catchy-- even complementary-- enough to keep the production's strengths at the forefront. The other main factor in his genius, as anyone who's had a radio on at any point in the last decade knows, is his ability to integrate unexpected niche-genre sonics most hip hop and R&B producers wouldn't steer towards-- bhangra, jungle, trance-- and use them for a kind of universal club futurism that, since it fits well in damn near every place people dance, makes for an easy route to chart and cultural dominance.When Tim's shit goes wrong, though, it's harder to get to the root of the problem. His recent bodybuilding obsession, his divisive, grandstanding mini-sets during the Justin Timberlake tour, and his forehead-smack of a beef with Scott Storch (?)(!) have made for great blog-snark gossip fodder, but they don't necessarily signal any kind of creative decline, especially after the juggernaut year he had in '06. But while solo Timbaland's always been a mixed bag, Timbaland Presents Shock Value is more mediocre than it has any right to be, filled with overreaching pretense and phoned-in vacancy-- either trying too hard, or not hard enough.Almost everything potentially great and really wrong about Shock Value is exhibited in leadoff track ""Oh Timbaland"". The beat's built on the same piano hook (from Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"") that Kanye West pillaged for Talib Kweli's ""Get By""-- he's just made it more manic, releasing some Dirty South tension with Shaq-hand-sized claps and Catfish Collins chicken-scratch guitar. It's a hell of a way to start things off, even assuming you don't care that a song about a man futilely trying to escape his transgressions is being appropriated so Tim can issue death threats and brag about his private planes. Simone's reconstructed voice is a sinister hook (""Oh Timbaland, where you gonna run to?""), and Tim's answer to this haunting, retribution-of-God threat (a quickly tossed-off ""nowhere""), is a sign of the hubris to follow."

They were André “3000” Benjamin and Antwan “Big Boi” Patton, but they went by an increasing array of colorful names—like Possum Aloysius Jenkins and Daddy Fat Sax—which seemed to exist only to expand minds and expectations while capturing the ideas that emanated from their craniums. They had emerged from southwest Atlanta with styles that were unforeseen, but quickly copied—the Kangol hats they wore in the video for “Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik” were soon seen atop the domes of Sean “Diddy” Combs and the Notorious B.I.G. after having been out of vogue for years. On the intro to Stankonia—their fourth album, a thrill-pushing auricular splattering of mindfunks and ideascapes—they mimicked those copying them by playfully reinterpreting the Atlanta “bounce” that had been spreading as the distraction of babies. Big Boi exhaled smoke and lamented, “Niggas ain’t even from the A-Town.”Identity and location—and defining and observing the two on their own terms—have always been key with OutKast. All of their albums began with a disembodied intro track as a prelude, followed by a State of the OutKast declaration that proved that, as André would famously go on to say at the 1995 Source Awards, “the South got something to say.” Tellingly, André confessed, “I gots a lot of shit up on my mind,” on “Myintrotoletuknow” from their 1994 debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Their voices spat out harsh rhymes and stretched out melodic moments, but they also spoke about things widely and deeply, respecting and commenting on everything going on hip-hop, largely by ignoring everything going on in hip-hop. Their sonic brashness and directness had Public Enemy’s Chuck D in its DNA, their fashion had antecedents in the Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five meeting Afrika Bambaataa’s Soul Sonic Force, the subversive whimsy of De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest were their forebears, giving the group a musical intensity and breadth incomparable to any other major hip-hop act before or since. Those are weighty statements, but OutKast was OutKast—singular, inimitable, and unpredictable.Their debut was an album bursting with the funk descended from the Isley Brothers, Isaac Hayes, and Curtis Mayfield in a way that was smoother than Dr. Dre’s G-funk stylings, more organic than Puff Daddy’s wholesale sampling of ’80s R&B, and more fluid and adventurous than hometown icon Jermaine Dupri’s sleek soul and pop arrangements. It was the music of Southern hip-hop, the “country rap tunes” pioneered by the late Pimp C, outfitted to a weary worldview that was cautious and specific about local dealings and paranoid about the greater world, but ultimately hopeful on universal levels—or, at least as hopeful as “Crumblin’ Erb” while “niggas killin’ niggas” can be."

For example: “Uptown Funk” vocalist and animatronic sequined suit Bruno Mars once sang the words “loungin’ on the couch just chillin’ in my Snuggie.” Every part of it is retroactively bizarre: the idea that Mars, the hardest-working embodiment of the “hardest-working man in showbiz” cliche, once attached himself to something called “The Lazy Song”; that he once aligned himself with flash-in-the-pan acoustic bros like Travie McCoy; or, more broadly, that he used to make pop in the 2010s that sounded like the 2010s. Much has been made of Mars’ childhood stint as an Elvis impersonator, with reason. The same talent that allowed a squeaky 4-year-old to channel, uncannily, the King’s gruff bark and distant whiff of scandal is the talent that allows Mars to inhabit whatever he wants. He’s as convincing a cheeky horndog (early hits with his production group the Smeezingtons include Flo Rida’s cheesy-sleazy hit “Right Round” and Mike Posner’s dubiously conceived “Bow Chicka Wow Wow”) as he is a worshipful loverman (the chaste stretch from “Nothin’ on You” through “Grenade”); he's as eager an omnivorous music fan (the Unorthodox Jukebox era remade Billy Joel and the Police as faithfully as any R&B or funk referents) as the comparatively laser-focused revivalist of 24K Magic.Also improbable: that “Uptown Funk,” still inescapable at weddings and stadiums near you, still has life in it, let alone an album’s worth. The title track to 24K Magic is all but an explicit retread: YSL swapped out for designer minks, Chucks for Inglewood’s finest shoes, corny “dragon wanna retire, man” line for corny line about red getting the blues, “Oops Upside Your Head” biting swapped out for only slightly less lawsuit-prone Zapp voiceover vocoders. What it lacks in a hook it makes up for (almost) with vibe, and more importantly, earnestness.24K Magic, the album, sticks to the same well-trod path. It often comes off as a one-man recreation of Mark Ronson’s similarly retro-fetishist Uptown Special—Ronson himself was tapped early on as a potential collaborator—with one key difference: all roles here are filled by Mars. Aside from a couple guest production jobs by former collaborators Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, the album is largely produced by Shampoo Press & Curl—a mildly reorganized incarnation of the Smeezingtons. And as Mars boasted in pre-album press, there are no features. The idea is that he needs no features. He’s become practically all things to all people—he has enough session-wonk credibility to appeal to the Grammy-voting industry types who’ve adopted Mars as a standard-bearer for Real Musicianship; he has enough pop and R&B cred to keep the radio listeners around; enough showmanship to pull off a Super Bowl halftime performance while barely into his career; enough wedding-reception goofiness to ingratiate himself to anyone left over."

Today, we revisit the sleek pop, British nationalism, and commercial girl power of the Spice Girls’ debut.","During a frantic television interview in 1997, the Spice Girls, at the very height of their global fame, are laughing raucously and slapping one another on the arms. They have a magnetic energy, half engaging the interviewer's questions, half conspiratorially chattering their own side-conversations. The host asks a question about whether the band feels that they are risking over-saturation in the media. Geri Halliwell says: “If you wanna call it over-exposure, or just mass media attention, I think that’s just the way society is: When you like strawberry ice cream, you eat loads of it.”The Spice Girls had materialized suddenly, seemingly fully formed, with their debut single “Wannabe” in June of 1996. It remains the biggest-selling single ever released by an all-female group in the UK. Complete with a one-take video in which they raised hell in a fancy London hotel, the song was bratty, with a ridiculous strutting drum track and a made-up refrain of “zig-ah-zig ahh.” It caught like wildfire.A succession of No. 1s followed, quickly leading to the September release of the debut album Spice, which sold two million copies in its first two weeks, and went on to go multi-platinum in 27 countries. Not only did the Spice Girls' numbers dwarf the blockbuster releases of the modern era, they introduced a new model of pop success. They dispelled the tired mythology that people weren’t interested in all-women pop groups; they pioneered shameless musician-brand partnerships; they made music and videos that directly targeted children—Melody Maker labeled them a “teenypop act”—and, launching their music in Asia first, they always set their sights on going global.It’s generally believed that the Spice Girls were the product of a master plan by their manager, Simon Fuller. It would be more accurate to describe them as the result of a plan that went completely wrong. The group was in fact created by a talent management agency, but it wasn’t Fuller—it was father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert, otherwise known as Heart Management. They were the ones who placed an ad in showbiz magazine The Stage in early 1994, looking for “streetwise, outgoing, ambitious and dedicated” under-23 women for an “all-female pop act.” Through rigorous auditions, the hundreds of applicants were narrowed down to Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown, and Victoria Adams. Later, the UK press would rename them Ginger, Baby, Sporty, Scary, and Posh.Unfortunately, the Herberts chose too well, and the five young women (aged between 18 and 22) turned out to have more ambition than their management. In David Sinclair’s whirlwind biography of the group, Wannabe, he tells the story of their heist: After becoming frustrated with a protracted development period and no contract with Heart Management, Geri, Mel C, and Mel B paid a visit to Heart’s offices, where they absconded with the master recordings of demos they had written so far (including “Wannabe”), met up with the rest of the Spice Girls at the side of a road, and drove up north."

Today, we revisit the English duo’s 1981 debut, a daring landmark of synth pop that went unexpectedly mainstream.","From the beginning, Soft Cell never looked quite right together. When the British duo made its debut on Top of the Pops in 1981, as its strutting, stripped-down cover of “Tainted Love” was climbing the charts, 24-year-old singer Marc Almond introduced himself in heavy black eyeliner, a studded neckband, and gold bangles, pouting and gyrating around the stage. Standing at a keyboard behind him was 22-year-old producer Dave Ball, the buttoned-up game-show host to Almond’s outré clubgoer. As Soft Cell, they created electronic pop tempered with Northern soul, the strain of American blues and soul music then being pumped through raucous UK clubs that rivaled New York City’s most debauched discos. The pair would leave a transgressive mark on the early 1980s and beyond, to their dismay.Almond grew up in Southport, a seaside town north of Liverpool where he felt out of place from an early age. Using pirate radio and movies as an escape from an abusive home life, he fostered an early love of camp and performance as someone “sexually confused, academically disadvantaged, and physically challenged,” as he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, Tainted Life. By the time he left for school in Leeds, Almond found delight in the bedsit he rented beneath a brothel, the only space he could afford. He festooned it with posters and red neon lights, planting the seeds for the delightfully sordid settings that would populate his lyrics.Ball was raised farther up the coast, adopted into a working-class family in Blackpool. He spent his youth attending parties at clubs like the Highland Room, the town’s premier Northern soul spot, and obsessively collecting Tamla and Stax singles after he heard them on the tartan-carpeted dancefloor. It was at one of those clubs that the 16-year-old Ball heard Gloria Jones’ voice for the first time, when her original rendition of “Tainted Love” sent his head spinning.By 1977, both were enrolled at Leeds Polytechnic; Almond, who had already earned a reputation as a scandalous performance artist (cat food and bloodletting were common elements), happened to be the first person Ball saw on campus, unmissable in gold lamé jeans and a leopard-print T-shirt. They were fast friends, kindred spirits in their obsessive love of punk and electronic music, cult films, and kitsch. Once Ball started to work seriously with a Korg synthesizer, he brought his experiments to Almond, pushing Soft Cell—a play on words that summed up their favorite themes of “consumerist nightmares and suburban insanity”—into its early stages.Synth pop was just beginning to find popular audiences in 1980, as the advent of cheaper equipment helped pave the way for a more democratic, far-flung scene. Ball and Almond’s music grew directly out of Kraftwerk’s pleasantly menacing electro pop, plus Suicide’s desiccated punk and the cabaret operatics of French chanson. Soft Cell debuted at a college Christmas show two short months after they met, performing ramshackle, anticonsumerist songs against a backdrop of Super 8 films of destroyed radios and industrial landscapes. The art-punk spark was lit. They would go on to perform more than 20 roughly sketched songs at subsequent shows, many of which formed the basis of their debut album (a spare, stuttering version of opener “Frustration” appeared on their four-track debut EP, Mutant Moments). Even early on, Almond’s lyrics were projected through a filmic lens smeared with grime: the duo’s tinny, galloping single “Girl With the Patent Leather Face,” inspired by J.G. Ballard’s Crash, memorably merges plastic surgery and S&M imagery into one twisted union."

Shortly thereafter, a young man was shot non-fatally in the leg at Hot 97, while 50 was still on-air, and gunfire was purportedly heard outside the offices of Violator, 50's management. That he started flexing his godfatherish persona mere days before he dropped The Massacre led some to speculate whether the whole thing was one ill-advised publicity stunt meant to invigorate his buzz and boost sales. As if to confirm the hunch, according to allhiphop.com, a week later, 50 was downplaying the whole ordeal, telling ""106 & Park"", ""A lot of things you hear out there is being said for shock value and not really as serious as people make it out to be.""Bullets don't joke. But while the ""publicity stunt"" analysis underestimates code of honor (and overestimates 50's and Game's collective rationality), you can't fault a kid for thinking like that. The Massacre, after all, tails 50's stratospherically successful Get Rich or Die Tryin' (which has thus far sold over 11 million copies); its release date had already been pushed back a month, and the two singles prefacing The Massacre-- ""Disco Inferno"" and ""Candy Shop""-- are flaccid reprises of other tracks both in beats and in timbre. (The former, of Lloyd Banks' ""On Fire"", beats by Eminem; the latter, 50 and Lil' Kim's ""Magic Stick"".).It's ironic that some of 50's best verses right now are his guest spots on The Game's The Documentary (particularly ""Hate It or Love It"" and ""How We Do""). The man's underperforming lyrically on The Massacre, but he stretches and croons and assures us a $50-million paycheck and a gigantic mansion in Connecticut have not expired his steely street soldiering: He's riding on the narrative and tough-mugging that got him here. And yet, The Massacre's best tracks have 50 dropping club-clatter and gangster lean to show us the mind behind the six-pack, gat, and Teflon.Clued in by an intro skit in which a sweet-sounding young damsel receiving a Valentine gets blasted by bullet-spray, we get it: 1) He's rich, and 2) He'll get you first. This is 50's massacre, no mercy. Scarface is in da club. It's followed by a series of guttural threats and luggish offerings to snuff anyone to save face-- ""y'all know what I'm about,"" 50 reminds us more than once. And in case we don't, he hits us with indelible, existential gloom, especially on ""This is 50""'s ominous piano plinking and the funereal low-end synths of ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"", where his warnings are cut directly from mobster cinema: ""Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with, son/ 'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done/ It's elementary, life is but a dream/ You know, row row your boat/ Your blood forms a stream."""

After releasing their debut in 2008, the Athens group did a stint opening for Dinosaur Jr. and the Meat Puppets, an apprenticeship that, for better or for worse, is evident on their sophomore album, Sugar. The guitars sound both sharper and muddier, the rhythm section condensed into a thunderous union, the vocals of Hardy Morris and Brantley Senn more prominent. In general, they sound more purposeful than ever, thanks to producer John Agnello, who has worked with Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth, and the Hold Steady.With Agnello at the helm, Dead Confederate come across as more capable, more professional-- in other words, not very exciting. Their music sounds calculated, at times lifeless. Senn is more of a presence here, trading vocal and songwriting duties with Morris, and the push and pull between them creates intriguing transitions and expands their range. Opener ""In the Dark"" recalls fellow Athenians the Whigs in its relatively upbeat cadence, and its swirling organ leads seamlessly into ""Run From the Gun"", which contains the album's strongest hook and Morris' best vocal performance. His strangely textured, androgynous voice is one of the band's most distinctive sounds, especially now that he's not straining for maximum angst. He shows some restraint on ""Father Figure"", an otherwise aimless track that channels Gish-era Smashing Pumpkins, and attempts some high-flying acrobatics on ""By Design"", soaring into his falsetto on the chorus.Sugar is notable as much for what's missing as for what's been honed and emphasized. Morris no longer howls like Kurt Cobain, nor does he drawl so studiously. There are no 12- or seven-minute stoner epics either; instead, the songs are shorter, more compact, punchier. Almost missing: personality. Part of the appeal of the band's self-released EP and, to a lesser extent, its debut was their ragged energy, the naïve excitement of young southerners messing around with non-native music, even if they were reaching beyond their grasp. Where once they got by on enthusiasm and sheer force of will, Sugar just sounds professional and deliberate. The songs no longer sound like Georgia, nor anywhere at all, and robbed of those roots and context, their music has no grounding, no subversive charm. Sugar is neither exciting nor egregious, neither good nor bad. It's just another rock record."

How could their whirlwind, vibraphone-driven post-rock get stuck in the background? Shouldn't it at least be distracting? As they finished their second full-length, Sugar, bassist Matthew Gengler wrote on their website: ""This year I'm pushing for more 'anthemic pelvic rockers' and fewer 'heartfelt ballads.'""And sure enough, after an attention-getting percussion intro, Sugar leaps into a song that pins your ears back like an extreme rollercoaster. ""They See Rocks"" vaults through its chord changes on Gengler's moon-walking bass and the one-man massacre of Cale Parks on drums. It has the lurching, exhilarating feel of Aloha's first albums, but this time the arrangement is bigger: Eric Koltnow's signature vibraphone mixes with electric piano and distorted guitar into molten rock candy.It's their loudest album, but the band still sound like music geeks: they favor pulsing rhythms to rock beats, and ""It Won't Be Long"" even echoes Steve Reich. On other tunes, they finally sound as jazzy as they've always threatened to be-- specifically, they're reminiscent of 70s fusion, with its driving rhythms and vague sense of conservatory educations. You can picture the dusty vinyl in their collections by bands like Weather Report and Eberhard Weber's Colours.They're not the first post-rock band to be serious instrumentalists, but they keep their chops in line by focusing on the songwriting. The mini-epic ""Let Your Head Hang Low"" and the exotic segues of ""Thieves All Around Us"" both fit inside five minutes, and the disturbingly titled ""Balling Phase"" may be their most ecstatic anthem yet. Tony Cavallario is also gaining confidence as a singer: his vocals are clearer and louder in the mix, but he's still earnest and direct, making sure he earns every high note and big chorus.Where their earlier songs were sometimes fragmentary, the material on Sugar is better developed, as each composition hold its own under independent scrutiny. As before, Aloha edits the songs together into continuous blocks of music, to replicate their live shows. However, this aspect also makes Sugar less fun than their last album, That's Your Fire, where the fast and slow songs hurtled into each other and shorter pieces of tunes ran into sprawling textural epics. To some listeners it sounded cobbled together, but to others, That's Your Fire was one of the more inspired post-rock albums of the past few years.Sugar needs more of that variety. Aloha throws everything they have-- their biggest arrangements and most belted-out lyrics-- at almost every song on the album. Near the end, ""Dissolving"" and ""I Wish No Chains Upon You"" each sound like just more anthemic bricks in the wall: either the band or the listener feels a little tapped. And Sugar could use more of the slow, spare tunes that Aloha was known for: in fact, the one thing this album truly lacks is one of the trademark, vaguely sappy ballads that the band is obviously trying to avoid. They might have been worried about getting typecast, but earlier songs like ""Roanoke Born"" and ""Saint Lorraine"" were-- and there's nothing wrong with it-- really fucking pretty. One or two of these per album won't make anyone think they're soft. Besides, I can't study over all this racket!"

And yet, the album's cover displays a mishmash of Christian or Muslim hands clasped in prayer, an upside-down star with funky characters on it, palmistry lines on the creepy hand, astrological symbols, crosses, some sort of masonic/Egyptian eye, devil horns, and the sun and moon. What's all that supposed to mean? It's like Douglas Adams' electric monk or something, programmed to believe up to 17 contradictory ideas at once.Electric monkism follows the band into its music-- cowpunk/psychobilly that deals in quasi-religious/sacreligious vagaries but only hints at a connection to the group's ironic Southern Baptist image. Clearly, they're not theologists, and they seem to think Satan's kinda neat in a noncommital way, so don't come for the preaching-- come for a shit-kicking good time. Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers could be considered style over substance but their music is so much fuxD1and, besides, they do style very well.They open the album with its high point-- a badass klezmer/rockabilly hoedown called ""Agony Wagon"", which kicks off with clarinet and accordion riffing, sweet shuffling drums, and fired-up vocal. They seem to realize how good it is, reprising it in the album's closing instrumental. In between, there's plenty of swaggering and stomping about, with big-reverb cowpunk like ""Bible Cyst"" and ""Where's the Devil...When You Need Him?"" rubbing up against the ramshackle acoustic waltz ballad ""The Pony to Bet On"" and distorted hard rock(abilly) numbers like ""Cussin' in Tongues"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson/Willie Dixon cover ""Help Me"". The mouth harp gets plenty of action, especially on ""Fistwhistle Boogie"", where vocalist Col. J.D. Wilkes lets loose on the thing like an Old Western mob on a prisoner.Believe is the second album from the Shack-Shakers (they had the gall to name the first one Cock-a-Doodle-Don't), and by the sound of things they've grown quite comfortable with their spiritually ambiguous ways and more importantly with their brand of wild, raving psychobilly. I actually wish they'd extended the klezmer tip through the whole album, because it's their most interesting card to play, but the chicken shack rock they came up with instead is full of enough piss and vinegar for a plenty good time."

The 24-year-old has been prolific—her evolution is displayed through the invention of various rap personas, such as Tina Snow, Megan Thee Stallion, and Hot Girl Meg, the turn-up queen with serious ambition on her mind. “We have so many legends and so many greats,” she recently said of her hometown of Houston, Texas. “But I don’t feel like we ever really had a female rapper from Houston or Texas shut that shit down.” With her debut project Fever, she hopes to succeed in doing just that.At its core is the intersection of two beautiful rap legacies: the women rap tradition started by MC Lyte and Queen Latifah, and Southern rap dynasty ushered in by Houston’s Geto Boys and Underground Kings. From the first song, Megan weaponizes misogyny through the execution of bars worthy of XXL Freshman Class President. South Park’s influence, home to fellow Houston legends Scarface and Lil’ Keke, is felt throughout “Hood Rat Shit,” which transitions into an ass-and clit-eating tutorial for her male tricks on “Pimpin,” where the spirit of Houston’s pimp tradition is embedded within every word. Sinister beats by producers Concept P and KC Supreme amplify Megan’s dedication to her set and willingness to actively to engage in ghetto affairs, despite her newfound rich bitch lifestyle. The track serves as a compliment to Juicy J’s production, which empowered Megan’s passionate highlight reel of recent wins of Houston’s champ.Reminiscent of Pam Grier’s dynasty of heroine Blaxploitation films that inspired Fever’s album cover, Megan’s sexual politics take center stage. For decades, black women in rap have been reduced to one-dimensional characters that lacked complexity, but Megan asserts herself as “Thee Stallion” and undoes the historically male-centered framework in favor of black women’s sexual narratives. Her assertiveness in the fulfillment of sexual desires and pleasures is highlighted by Southern laced samples of UGK, Three 6 Mafia, and Project Pat to illustrate a sizzurp-induced night of ecstasy, where Megan is in charge of her body, and models to “hotties” how to enjoy theirs.“Nine times out of 10, I’m the realest bitch you know/If you ain’t want a pimp then what you fuckin’ with me for,” she raps in “Running Up Freestyle,” challenging any pimps wary of power. Megan’s delivery of perfectly executed bars are comparable to successions from a fully automatic machine gun; a carefully studied aim of fiery stanzas that could only be carried by a rapper with extensive knowledge of the genre’s early practices of battle rap. Her reign is amplified by the embrace of a rich bitch identity, who takes pleasure in ending the lives of those attempt to block her financial avenues and asserts herself as the number one pimp in “Money Good.”"

The suggestion is a lack of fluidity, a general sense of strain. It’s a weighted assessment generally reserved for skill players, like running backs or wide receivers, for whom looking stiff can forecast injury or inertia. Black Milk used to rap like a skill player with tight hips. His flow can be jerky and the calculated stammer in his delivery can reveal his straining. But a few years ago the Detroit artist seemed to switch positions for the better, slowing down and loosening up to take the load off his raps.At the same time, over his last few albums Black Milk has sidled into the role of bandleader first and rapper second, to the point that his last record was an entirely instrumental affair. He didn’t play any of the instruments on the meandering The Rebellion Sessions, for which the leader and his band were billed as Black Milk & Nat Turner, but he produced and arranged every song. Freeing himself of the pressure of the microphone—he was always a producer first—seemed like an epiphany, and the album was one of the most gratifyingly experimental that Black Milk has recorded. His new one, a solo rap record called FEVER, confirms he’s still a serviceable emcee prospering as a session leader with a sense of purpose.FEVER continues the Detroit rapper/producer’s expanding live hip-hop jazz-band tradition and leans into psychedelic neo-soul in the process, something like P-Funk meets the Ummah. Black Milk is using a softer touch with drums than his previously bludgeoning  boom-bap productions might have predicted, with a pair of accomplished session players, Chris Dave and Daru Jones, at the center of the mix. Their shuffling breaks—loose but punctual, and never boxy—quietly gas most of the record. The whole album has a warm hue, but the shape and pace of the tracks morph quickly.Opener “unVEil” tumbles a dreamy reggae step out of the hum of a wavering synth line. Guitar guitar licks are frequently ornamental filigree on top of bulbous bass notes. “But I Can Be” has the rigid loop of a traditional Black Milk beat, but most of the songs take a more open-ended shape and allow room for woozy wandering. In the very middle of the record, a floaty instrumental interlude without any drums captures the muddy palette of the whole thing as warm synths flutter around each other and under a reverberating guitar. On “Will Remain” Black Milk channels a softly bubbling jazz soul, while “Drown” is a swampy funk groove."

You wouldn't ever congratulate a friend who spent months getting his oven to function as a refrigerator, but anyone who can make a vacuum sound like an 808 can prepare for notoriety, if not outright praise. Artists such as Matthew Herbert, the Field, and Matmos have diced sounds until their notable sources are barely detectable. So it goes with 2562, whose third album, Fever, was inspired by disco music (hence the title) released in the late 1970s around the time of the producer's birth. It's probably a smart gambit for the producer: His first two albums, while well received, were more notable for expanding dubstep's geographical imprint (2562 is the postal code of the producer's home in the Hague) than its sonic one.Despite its roots-- every last sound here is sampled from disco records-- Fever is a fairly catholic dubstep set: Racketeering snares, ominous chord structures, and a vague melodic distension pervade the album. Still, you can hear the fruits of his labor, especially in comparison to 2009's Unbalance. Fever is warmer, due both to its subtle vinyl crackle and the vague symphonic timbre that hovers whenever its minute samples are massed in melody. The persistent, four-on-the-floor clacking that propels ""Brasil Deadwalker"" is a visceral reminder of how techno and house borrowed and digitized disco's rhythmic structure. The anthemic opener ""Winamp Melodrama"" (great title) grabs a Gamble & Huff hammer and bangs everything in sight. 2562 doesn't employ vocal samples very often, but on the album-closing title track he gathers several into a dense fog and achieves a kind of beauty rarely attempted elsewhere on the album.About that: Fever, like 2562's previous records, is hard music. There is no wobble in the bass or flutter in the melodies; they are presented as-is, with little space for the listener. Fever can sound plastic, unpliable at times. I can hear the echoes of those old disco records in these sounds, but I can't find any of the laughter, silliness, or goodwill that fueled them. 2562 spent a lot of time molding one genre of music into another: It's safe to say he cares about sound for sound's sake. Which is fine, but it also means that the process that drove Fever's creation wasn't undertaken in an effort to illuminate the source material (it should be said that while most genres of dance music owe a healthy debt to disco, dubstep is really more of a third cousin than a granddaughter) or forge new territory. It was done as an exercise.So parts of Fever-- the bone-on-bone thwacks that close ""Flavour Park Jam"", for instance-- are essentially just 2562 going through the motions: the tedious, musically rigorous motions. I adore the idea behind Fever, and the attempt to artistically bind oneself to a process like this is brave. But in boxing himself in, 2562 seems to have found just a new box, a constricted area where several of his compositions suffocate. Those that escape are enjoyable as some kind of tonally curious, hardscrabble bass music, which is where 2562 began in the first place."

The verb felt like a mission statement for the Golden State magpies. A pan-psychedelic rock band, Sleepy Sun seemed intent on tying together the electric and acoustic ends of Led Zeppelin's discography and wrangling its favorites-- British folk, stoner metal, and classic rock among them-- together with the lasso. That inclusive approach had its consequences, though, especially with equivocation. Because Sleepy Sun fit so many elements into Embrace, each piece felt a bit unadventurous and overly familiar, though the album as a whole encouraged the unexpected.Sleepy Sun's second LP exaggerates the problems of its predecessor by pushing nothing too far or too hard. ""Sandstorm Woman"", the 10-minute closing epic, feels like little more than the middle-aged house band at your neighborhood biker bar coming down from a set-break joint. The pensive moments come as if presaged by telegraph. The big rock outro-- all sweaty frontman glossolalia, guitar spirals, harmonica howls, and stretched drum rolls-- gradually slows its tempo and restrains its roar, resolving into a tidy, diminished coda. Unlike Earthless, Sleep, or any of the dozens of bands who have taken such moments to hell and the moon, Sleepy Sun bring it back to Earth and let it rest. It's the refusal to get too crazy, and it's boring. Many of these nine tracks suffer from the same half-there approach. The acoustic tunes stacked early do little but drift daintily. ""Open Eyes"" starts as a promising mix of clipped meters and refracted vocals. Ultimately, though, it heads for the same electric rock peaks that Black Mountain conquered on 2008's In the Future (see that band's ""Tyrants""). Sleepy Sun fall well short.Such circumscription isn't Fever's only problem, though it is the most vexing. Thing is, you've probably heard all of this before, via Zeppelin, Mountain, Sabbath, Pentangle, or any of the thousands of bands that have cited those acts as influences. Sleepy Sun's psychedelic rock is of a cut-and-paste variety, where a few decades of platitudes are snipped from their sources and simply rearranged. There's a fat-bottomed drum breakdown attached to a harmonica solo on ""Desert God"", and a fascination with stop-time and slow-burn maneuvers dominates ""Wild Machines"". ""Marina"" gets the mid-song auxiliary percussion and tribal chanting, while ""Freedom Line"" sports the meditative vocal intro. OK, dudes, we get it-- you like LPs, too.All that said, Fever is beyond capably played and produced. Bret Constantino and Rachel Fannan offer adaptable voices, as fit for the thunder-on-the-mountain dramatics of ""Open Eyes"" as they are the across-a-bedroom intimacy of ""Ooh Boy"". Guitarists Matt Holliman and Even Reiss sound ready for most anything, too, whether it's the meticulous distortion and electric swells throughout ""Acid Love"" or the lithe, intertwining acoustic guitars during ""Rigamaroo"". The bass maw and stuttering drums of ""Freedom Line"" twist and shift, and producer Stewart affords enough sonic presence-and-pop to make it seem as though the band is practicing across the hall. And that's what makes Fever so frustrating. Sleepy Sun have learned the methods and studied the maps, but-- at least on record-- they've yet to take that knowledge into territory that feels new or, really, like it's their own."

When the soap began airing in the UK, Minogue's popularity soared. In 1987, she recorded a demo version of Little Eva's 60s pop hit ""The Locomotion"" for charity, and actually submitted the recording to the UK label Mushroom. Mushroom was fairly keen to release something by the young star, though weren't necessarily impressed by the recording.\xA0 The label decided to turn the Minogue situation over to a team of producers they'd just entered into a partnership with: Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who were fresh of producing major hits for Bananarama, Rick Astley and Dead or Alive. Of course, Stock, Aitken and Waterman wanted to work with Minogue, but didn't take her very seriously, and didn't even have material for her on the day she showed up to their studios.\xA0 Legend has it, they came up with the tune ""I Should Be So Lucky""\xA0in ten minutes, which became Minogue's second #1 single in Australia and England. Perhaps due to the relatively haphazard experience of recording under the SAW blade, Minogue gradually took matters into her own hands throughout the 90s.\xA0 The team continued to work with her in the early 90s, as Minogue scored more hits, and even began contributing her own lyrics.Her work ethic has been similar to Madonna's, in that she makes it a habit to produce interesting videos for her songs (usually opting for the role of seductress rather than clean cut girl-next-door), and always keeps her sound current. She also worked with many different collaborating producers after leaving the SAW team in 1991.\xA0 Her relationship with the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence resulted in further musical experimentation, going so far as to work with Nick Cave for the tune ""Where the Wild Flowers Grow,"" in addition to working with members of Manic Street Preachers for her 1997 release Impossible Princess."

When she plays drums or guitar, or worst of all, when she breaks out the ukulele, she persists with mechanical patience, switching chords like she's just getting the knack, and rendering some pretty decent lyrics in either a sing-song or a monotone. The plainness of it all is disarming, and not in a good way: it's like a child who's just stopped being cute. And that's not even counting the crayon-and-marker-colored liner notes.""Gimme a T! Gimme an R! Gimme a U! Gimme a C! Gimme a K! For truckers!""Around the eighth time she sings, ""I am an emergency vehicle,"" you wonder if anything's wrong, yet nothing here points to a crisis or problem-- in fact, this is some of the most transparently confident music around. Instead of giving us a mystery or asking us to psychoanalyze her, she seems to be striking out boldly, expecting us to take her as-is. Or, as she puts it in the liner notes: ""I'm not a dreamer. I make things happen. I also coach.""What seems so weird may just be the simplicity of her style, how ur-punk her tools are-- the lack of colors, the bare singing, and the use of repetition all suggest that any additional instrumentation or melody or anything other than the most starkly minimal elements would be an excess. Granted, Niblett occasionally receives some support from another guitarist and drummer, but even they seem to value sparseness, and more often than not, they're nowhere to be found anyway: most of I Am consists simply of Scout alone with an instrument, singing in that folky-dry British voice that has mostly been commended for how American it sounds. And Steve Albini-- the perfect engineer for this project-- captures her in perfect, quiet solitude.I Am, though more settled than her crazed singing and amateur drum-bashing on the I Conjure Series EP, is still pretty far from the minimal but warmly bluesy Sweet Heart Fever. On ""Drummer Boy"", the guitars fall like an avalanche, but other tracks are so focused they become faintly desperate: she gets some yearning tones from her ukulele, buried under the annoying ones. As for the lyrics, they reveal more subtlety than you infer from her singing. ""Texas"", for one, is rather elegant with its ""postcard from an art school girlfriend"" language: ""And Texas is hot/ Even when driving at night/ And Texas is sci-fi/ And Texas is plain/ And Texas is alright"", each verse punctuated by a whomp on the drums.This record is definitely an acquired taste, but what you get is an appreciation for a difficult but ultimately honest artist, stripped out of the ""rock"" or ""country"" labels into a private cave of her own-- like anything that wasn't 100% Scout got cut and thrown away, and whether you like what's left, at least you know it's hers. This kind of record is no fun to rate, because where I'd want a little more anything (more developed songs, maybe, or a little more emotional range in these parched-earth vocals), I know that others will be hit in the gut by every weird little tune on this album. Like any kind of nakedness, it's up to you how to take it."

Over a frantic, Calvin Harris-produced, Guetta-meets-""Sandstorm"" beat on her sixth record's lead-off single, Rihanna repeats these words almost 20 times. ""We Found Love"" ranks among Ri's best singles because it recognizes that there's not much more that needs to be said: in three and a half minutes, the line moves from being a great pop lyric to a triumphant mantra to something suggestive of a whole spectrum of unspoken emotion. The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret. Need I remind you of some of her most powerful hooks: Ella-ella-ella-ay. Oh-na-na. Ay-ayy-ay-ayy-ay-ayy.But as anyone with a Twitter handle will tell you, these are chatty times, and in 2011, the pop landscape's fittingly caught between two maximalist extremes: the winking theatricality of Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry, and the dribbling confessional-pop of Drake, Kanye West, and (yes, they're more alike than they'd like to believe) Taylor Swift. Barbados-born, millions-selling, armfuls-of-awards-winning Rihanna has found staggering success (23 years old; eleven #1 singles and rising) borrowing a little bit from each of these tendencies. Her recent music videos have dabbled in trendy pop artifice (check out her neon-hued, irresistibly smiley turn in Guetta’s ""Who’s That Chick?"" or the David LaChapelle-aping-- literally-- ""S&M""), while her brooding and personal 2009 album Rated R commented-- however obliquely-- on her public struggles. Rihanna seems more comfortable flitting between these two extremes than settling on either, but her past two albums have at least had some thematic cohesion. The same can't be said of Talk That Talk: Heavy on filler though it's only 11 tracks long, it feels not only slight but muddled, an assortment of half-baked ideas that never bloom. A stitched-together collection of club bangers, sleaze-pop missteps, and mid-tempo inspirational ballads, Talk That Talk feels at times like three different records, only one of which might have been any good.Of course, what we're supposed to be talking is about how this is Rihanna's ""dirtiest"" album yet. Early blog chatter reported to lots of critics blushing in preview listening sessions and making questionably bold declarations (""The dirtiest pop album since Madonna's Erotica!"") that suggested that they listen to very little pop radio, or that they have never been to an R. Kelly concert. Talk That Talk's raunchier moments should surprise no one: Rihanna's always been singing about sex-- she's just never shown such an unfortunate proclivity for cheesy lyrics and dessert metaphors. ""Suck my cockiness/ Lick my persuasion,"" Ri commands on the embarrassingly literal ""Cockiness (I Love It)"", hoping the boldness of the delivery will distract you from thinking about what a clunky line it is (it won't, though Bangladesh's beats might). The Esther Dean-penned ""Drunk on Love"" features a weak chorus lyric and vocal whose bombast feels out of place in the track's laid back, xx-sampling atmosphere. Clocking in at a puzzling-yet-merciful one minute and 18 seconds, The-Dream co-produced ""Birthday Cake"" is even more heavy-handed (lots of icing puns). There are flickers of empowerment here, but mostly it proves little more than the fact that a female artist can be responsible for Jeremih-grade cheese, too. A Rihanna album has never been without the occasional lyrical misfire (""Sex in the air/ I don't care/ I love the smell of it"" comes to mind), but at least on a track like ""S&M"" she sounds like she's having fun. For a record so preoccupied with passion and pleasure, most of Talk That Talk feels unsuitably robotic."

It’s a syntactical maze of local culture that doubles as a flier for the greatest party you could ever imagine.,"It was April 1999, and Nelly was driving his close friend City Spud to a St. Louis police station. The pair were so inseparable and looked so much alike that they were often mistaken for brothers. They liked that, though Nelly and City would eventually dispell the notion. When Nelly dropped City at the precinct, it was the last time they would see each other before their lives split off into wildly different trajectories.Days earlier, City, born Lavell Webb, was party to a botched robbery. He’d just quit his job at a North County McDonald’s and was relying on small-to medium-time weed deals to keep the lights on. On April 15, he was supposed to meet a potential customer for a $1,500 transaction. Customer gets off work, calls the pager, money and product change hands. Simple. The problem? Webb doesn’t have a car. The only person he found to drive him had proposed a new plan: instead of the arranged handoff, they’d rob the buyer, netting a grand for the driver and $500 for Webb, who could simply stay in the car.Webb reluctantly agreed and waited in a parking lot near the mark’s home while the driver, masked and armed, headed out on foot. Minutes ticked by. Then: gunshots. Webb turned his head and saw his accomplice running back to the car; when he slumped into the driver’s seat, he was holding only $30. “Man, I had to pop him,” he said.Police found the victim wounded but alive. He told the cops that his assailant knew about the $1,500 in his pocket, information that could have come from only one source: Lavell Webb.Word trickled out that the cops were looking for him. Webb’s grandmother and her husband, who had been visited by detectives, urged him to have someone take him down to talk to the police. The husband told the Riverfront Times in 2001 that he feared what would happen if Webb laid low: “These trigger-happy cops—a young black man fleeing—were going to kill him.”Barely more than a year after the robbery gone wrong, Webb would have four production credits and a show-stealing guest verse on Country Grammar, one of the best-selling rap albums of all time. But his royalties would only be topping off commissary accounts. Despite turning himself in, aiding with the investigation, and even helping to search for the gunman, Webb was arrested and charged. He eventually plead guilty to first-degree robbery and one count of armed criminal action, and was sentenced to ten years on the former, three years on latter, to be served concurrently.

Without his confession, the only evidence police had was circumstantial."

Daft Punk seem to be operating under the premise that if you hear something enough times, you'll start to believe it. But after more than 15 listens to Discovery's first single and opening track, ""One More Time,"" vocodered vocalist Romanthony doesn't have me ""feeling the need,"" much less not waiting, celebrating, and dancing so free. This could just be me, of course. Maybe I just haven't taken enough ecstasy and horse tranquilizers to appreciate the tinny, sampled brass ensemble, the too-sincere ""chill out"" midsection, or the fat drum machine beats that throb in time with my headache.Few things are more incriminating than Daft Punk's own lyrics, which, while generally deeper than ""don't stop the dancing,"" rarely go beyond sensitive junior high poetry and ""could this be love"" Whitesnake-isms. But music like this wasn't meant to be judged on its lyrics. And since Discovery relies heavily on the French neo-disco stylings established by 1997's Homework, the duo would probably suggest we shut up and dance.In truth, Discovery rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk, and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed ""One More Time."" Instead, Daft Punk focus on fusing mid-80's Kool and the Gang R&B; beats with post-millennial prog flourishes and more vocoders than you can shake at Herbie Hancock. Of the six tracks that feature vocals, four are smothered with the synthesized pitch corrector. On tracks like ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,"" the duo make it work by pushing the instrument to its breaking point, squeezing out subhuman glips and merging the vocals into a Vai-style synth-guitar solo. But when the band relies on the tool merely as a gimmick, as on ""Digital Love"" and ""Something about Us,"" the sentimental love songs come off with all the heart-melting earnestness of Kid Rock's ""Only God Knows Why.""Daft Punk typically succeed in an instrumental environment, though. Discovery's first big score comes with the rousing ""Crescendolls."" The obscure Imperials sample makes the song with spirited ""hey's"" and ""everybody y'all's"" yelled out from a crowd. ""Superheroes,"" which draws its repeated refrain from a late 70's Barry Manilow track called ""Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed,"" sates with a massive, fist-pumping kickdrum, complex chord changes, and light-speed keyboard bleeps. The snapping percussion and Phantasy Star II phaser synths of ""Verdis Quo"" recall a somber Flashdance-era Giorgio Moroder. And the 16-bit pitch-bent tones and Klymaxx electro-bass of ""Short Circuit"" would have felt at home on Trans Am's Surrender to the Night.Prog and disco have never openly begged for their own hybrid, but the genres' newborn Frankenbaby is alive, whether we like it or not. Still, this beast, however grotesque, is relatively harmless-- rather than running amok in the village and snapping the necks of civilians, it only wants to ""celebrate and dance so free, one more time."" Just don't let it sing."

Today, we revisit Shakira’s big crossover record that revealed her fascinating, idiosyncratic songwriting and created a rift among her fans.","In early 2001, Shakira was holed up on a farm in Uruguay, surrounded by her close family and a herd of cows. She’d just spent the last three years touring and performing across Latin America, establishing herself as a pop goddess with a rockera edge. Now she was convalescing in a quieter place, trying to write an album for an English-speaking audience that would somehow preserve the spirit of her trenchant pop-rock—all without forsaking the legion of Latin American fans that made her a pop luminary. It seemed to be an impossible task.Over the next year, Shakira would confront this challenge head-on, embracing the totality of transition. The video for “Underneath Your Clothes” was the Colombian singer’s self-aware introduction to Anglo audiences. In the opening scene, a thirsty journalist chases after her through the Palace Theater in Los Angeles, her newly blonde—but still tousled—braids silhouetted under an oversized Brixton cap. He asks, “Shakira, Shakira: What’s it like to crossover and sing in English?” The rockera launches into a breathless monologue in Spanish about music’s ability to create a spiritual connection between spectators and performers, about the poetry of music beyond the artificial borders of language. As she walks away, the reporter begs, “Oh, but in English!”It’s unlikely that such a calculated, performative exchange would appear in a Latinx artist’s English-language debut today. But back then, industry conventions dictated that Shakira be explicit in her approach. As she told MTV’s Making the Video, “I wanted that scene so badly in the video, because it’s something that is daily bread in my life lately.” Today, listeners around the globe are a bit smarter, less receptive to such overt maneuvers when artists are navigating new audiences. But we have only begun to challenge these stale tropes—and question the fantasy of “boom” narratives, where Latinx artists appear and disappear every few years based on their legibility to Anglo audiences.That clear-eyed intentionality at the beginning of “Underneath Your Clothes” was the crux for her metamorphosis into an international supernova. Long before the Beyoncé collaboration, the World Cup anthem, and the forays into watered-down reggaetón, Shakira Mebarak Ripoll proudly used her versatility in her favor. As she told Colombian daily El Tiempo in 2001, “Fusion offers me the opportunity to remove any type of label people want to place on me. It gives me freedom...I don’t want to be tied to a specific style and become the architect of my own prison.”"

In New York City, Teyana Taylor’s hometown, the disparity is even more staggering. People like Beyoncé and Serena Williams have shared their own experiences with maternal health, driving some coverage into the news cycle and confirming that not even fame and seven-star healthcare can vanquish medical racism. Though Taylor doesn’t call it out directly, this context skulks around the first minute of The Album, whose intro repurposes leaked audio of the 911 call that chronicled the bathroom-floor delivery of her firstborn daughter Junie in 2015. “I’m holding my daughter in my hands,” mewls husband Iman Shumpert, before scrambling to tie off the umbilical cord.Junie, now 5, is the next voice to appear, softening the tension of her arrival into the world with a merry “turn it up!” She croons alongside her mother and Rick Ross on “Come Back to Me,” joining a club of celebrity children earning major-label royalty statements. The song is followed by another family affair; “Wake Up Love” features Shumpert, a 2016 NBA champion and part-time rapper, doing a gentle André 3000 impression. Last week, a cherubic video for the single doubled as an announcement that the couple is expecting their second child.Since becoming a mother and foregrounding her family, Taylor has found new momentum. When her slick, sexy turn as a “protective lioness” in Kanye West’s 2016 video for “Fade” introduced her to new audiences, she seized on the curiosity about her postpartum physique to create a dance-fitness business. (Taylor was careful in interviews to push back against scrutiny of women’s bodies after pregnancy.) She has also opened a nail salon named after Junie, starred in a family reality show alongside Shumpert, and launched The Aunties, a familial production company that has directed videos for Schoolboy Q and Lil Duval.The Album, Taylor’s third album, better represents the fierce persona she has honed in public. It is something of a corrective to 2018’s K.T.S.E., the project that concluded Kanye’s messy Wyoming spring. Taylor shined over some of her label boss’ most compelling production in years, but the men of G.O.O.D. Music fumbled her rollout and released a version she hadn’t approved herself. It recalled her early music experiences as a teen signed to Pharrell’s Star Trak label, when she was denied the autonomy she craved. This time, recording largely while quarantined at home during the pandemic, Taylor snatches her control back. “When people hear the album, they will understand what my frustration was with K.T.S.E. Trying to put a lot of emotion within seven songs is tough. To have a full album, you get to literally express yourself and every single part of you,” she said in an interview with NPR."

Most of his tracks don’t have them; neither do most of his records. His debut album is called The Album. This edition, via R&S Records’ ambient sub-label Apollo, is actually the reissue of an untitled 2x12” from late 2016 that fans tend to refer to by its catalog number, SUE015—SUED being the Berlin-based, vinyl-only record label where the spotlight-shy electronic musician releases most of his music. Most of SUED’s releases don’t have titles, in fact; tracks on the label tend toward identifiers like “Track 1” and “Track 2.” And SUED’s artists go by aliases that don’t even sound real: SW., SVN, XI, PG Sounds, Club No-No. The lone exception in SW.’s catalog is Reminder, a trio of EPs released between 2013 and 2015. The title is simple, he explained to Resident Advisor: It’s meant as a “reminder of the good things” that have come out of Detroit, Chicago, and the UK’s dance music scenes.We can only guess at the reasons SW. is so tight-lipped, and what that might have to do with his particular style of electronic music, which is at once ecstatic and guarded: a distrust of flowery language, a delight in tripping up search engines, a desire to keep the focus on the sounds alone? Because his music is anything but generic. These aren’t identikit club tools, but deeply expressive machine jams that draw from the breadth of dance music’s history—particularly the mid and late 1990s, an often-overlooked period for which SW. displays a particular fondness.Much like DJ Sports’ recent Modern Species, which covered similar territory, SW. refuses to restrict himself to any one style. The album’s 11 cuts cover atmospheric drum ‘n’ bass, deep house, lush techno-jazz, peak-time floor-fillers, and pure, pulsing ambient. A few of the record’s tracks are suffused in chirping birds and insects—a tantalizing bit of rainforest ambience that only contributes to the music’s humid, enveloping feel—and if temperatures run a few degrees hotter than usual, so do tempos. On the mellow end of things, tropical fantasias like “Untitled A2” and “Untitled B1” bubble along around 130 beats per minute, a generous clip by any standard. Full of brushed cymbals and snares, rippling hand percussion, and shimmering synths, they feel a little bit like drum-circle variants of Detroit techno and classic IDM. The bookending drum ‘n’ bass tunes are somewhere around the 140-BPM mark, and so is “Untitled D2,” a bone-shaking techno anthem that’s part “The Bells,” part broken beat."

And then there's the rock bands: Fall Out Boy, The Hives, and She Wants Revenge. And then there's Elton John. And Magoo.  : /","When it comes down to the big three producer-MCs who have defined club-friendly rap over the past decade-- Diddy, Pharrell and Timbaland-- Tim's the one who's been best able to rein in his self-indulgent tendencies. He hasn't spent more time being a pop icon than a musician, hasn't suffered from any major dry spells of creative entropy and, most importantly, has known enough to let his beats do most of the heavy lifting. This might be one of the reasons he's considered by most trainspotter pop fiends to be more of a genius than those other two; even when Tim runs his mouth, it's typically been innocuously catchy-- even complementary-- enough to keep the production's strengths at the forefront. The other main factor in his genius, as anyone who's had a radio on at any point in the last decade knows, is his ability to integrate unexpected niche-genre sonics most hip hop and R&B producers wouldn't steer towards-- bhangra, jungle, trance-- and use them for a kind of universal club futurism that, since it fits well in damn near every place people dance, makes for an easy route to chart and cultural dominance.When Tim's shit goes wrong, though, it's harder to get to the root of the problem. His recent bodybuilding obsession, his divisive, grandstanding mini-sets during the Justin Timberlake tour, and his forehead-smack of a beef with Scott Storch (?)(!) have made for great blog-snark gossip fodder, but they don't necessarily signal any kind of creative decline, especially after the juggernaut year he had in '06. But while solo Timbaland's always been a mixed bag, Timbaland Presents Shock Value is more mediocre than it has any right to be, filled with overreaching pretense and phoned-in vacancy-- either trying too hard, or not hard enough.Almost everything potentially great and really wrong about Shock Value is exhibited in leadoff track ""Oh Timbaland"". The beat's built on the same piano hook (from Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"") that Kanye West pillaged for Talib Kweli's ""Get By""-- he's just made it more manic, releasing some Dirty South tension with Shaq-hand-sized claps and Catfish Collins chicken-scratch guitar. It's a hell of a way to start things off, even assuming you don't care that a song about a man futilely trying to escape his transgressions is being appropriated so Tim can issue death threats and brag about his private planes. Simone's reconstructed voice is a sinister hook (""Oh Timbaland, where you gonna run to?""), and Tim's answer to this haunting, retribution-of-God threat (a quickly tossed-off ""nowhere""), is a sign of the hubris to follow."

Though he would become even more successful in the '80s, Off the Wall remains unabashedly fun to return to for its joy and lack of baggage. For 41 minutes, we can live in the eternally young Neverland Michael longed for, a universe largely without consequence or death.","In the summer of 1976, a variety show called ""The Jacksons"" debuted on CBS. The program came about during a relatively fallow period for the showbiz brood, after the Jackson 5 ignited nationwide fervor with hits like ""ABC"" and ""I’ll Be There"" but before Michael Jackson set out for solo superstardom. Their future success seemed in doubt, and the show—with its glaring lights, sparkling costumes, and rampant cheesiness—was a Vegas-style extravaganza that played to well-worn pleasures. One recurring segment called ""On the Wall"" saw Michael inviting various guest hosts to sign a fake brick facade and do a little dance before everyone eventually ended up in a frozen ta-dah! pose. Though Michael was all smiles on ""The Jacksons,"" he later claimed that he ""hated every minute"" of it. During the show’s year-long run, he was smack in the middle of gangly teenagedom, acne and all. Raised in the limelight by an infamously strict father, Michael was painfully self-conscious, worried that he might never be able to shake his child stardom. He didn’t want to merely cling to his family’s fading notoriety. He wanted to break away from it completely.Off the Wall is the sound of that liberation. And he knew exactly what he was doing. On November 6, 1979, just as the album was starting to take off, Michael wrote a note to himself on the back of a tour itinerary, a proclamation of self so ambitious it could make Kanye blush. ""MJ will be my new name, no more Michael Jackson. I want a whole new character, a whole new look, I should be a totally different person. People should never think of me as the kid who sang ‘ABC’ [and] ‘I Want You Back,’"" he jotted down. ""I should be a new incredible actor singer dancer that will shock the world. I will do no interviews. I will be magic. I will be a perfectionist, a researcher, a trainer, a masterer… I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it. Take it steps further from where the greats left off.""Those words were eerily prescient in many ways, of course, but they also highlight one of Michael’s most important dualities: He wanted to be magical—to defy expectation and reality—but he knew that such skills could not materialize from thin air. He understood that exceptionalism took hard work. Growing up in the Motown system, he would often sit in on sessions, soaking up lessons from the greats: Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations. He studied the way James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr., and Fred Astaire moved their feet onstage, in movies, and on TV. At 17, he counted hallowed masters like Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Duke Ellington among his favorite songwriters. He had released four solo albums in the early ’70s, but Off the Wall, which came out when he was 21, finally allowed him to flex all those hours of research into something that was his."

His various collaborations and genre shifts are numerous and well documented, evidence of a lifetime of curiosity. But Allen will forever be known as the virtuosic drummer in Fela Kuti’s Africa 70 band—the man whose genre-defining rhythms drove the Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer’s renowned sound. He quite literally put the beat in Afrobeat.The legacy of the late Hugh Masekela, who died in 2018, is no less majestic. As a trumpeter he made his mark on every band he played with. Exiled from South Africa during apartheid, he spent much of the 1960s in London and New York, scoring a No.1 hit with “Grazing in the Grass” and making a name for himself on the Manhattan jazz scene. By 1984 he was in West Africa, where, through Fela, his friend and contemporary, he met Allen.Almost as soon as they connected, the two decided they should try to make music together, but it would be more than 25 years before they finally met up in London’s Livingston Studios. Those 2010 sessions flowed like a conversation, with Allen laying down a drum track, Tom Herbert or Mutale Chashi adding bass, and Masekela answering with melodies on his flugelhorn. The result is Rejoice, a collaborative record that Allen calls “a kind of South African-Nigerian swing-jazz stew,” a skeletal Afrobeat infused with the spirit of bebop, with lyrics in English, Yoruba, and Zulu reflective of the transatlantic exchange that has defined the African diaspora for centuries.Allen has been cooking up variations of this recipe for the past few years: It’s evident in the jazz stylings of his last solo LP, The Source, and in his tribute to bebop legend Art Blakey, who he credits as a major influence to his own style. His recordings with Masekela feel like old friends catching up after years apart. Masekela’s flugelhorn is the most expressive voice on the record, bright and nimble, piercing in tone but gentle in force, bearing passport stamps from Johannesburg, London, and New York. Allen’s touch is light, but he strikes with the confidence of a player who knows he doesn’t need to attack the drum to be heard. His snare drives the grooves, occasionally sputtering into micro-rolls, and the full-kit fills occupy the negative space in Masekela’s melodies. They’re effortlessly in sync, belying their limited experience collaborating with each other.The record’s session players are plucked from London’s contemporary jazz scene: the Ezra Collective’s Joe Armon-Jones on keys, Chashi (Kokoroko) and Herbert (Acoustic Ladyland) on bass, and Steve Williamson on tenor saxophone, among others. Each instrument is rendered in stunning detail; from a technical standpoint, Rejoice is a  remarkable feat of production from World Circuit’s Nick Gold. The record’s stereo imaging places you in Allen’s shoes, directly behind the kit. On “Coconut Jam,” as the hi-hat and snare keep time in one ear, the ride cymbal punctuates the beat in the other, and fills across the toms ripple across the soundstage from right to left, the echo of each strike as clear as if you were in the room. You’d be hard-pressed to find a cleaner, more elegantly mixed recording of Allen’s stick work."

Today we revisit a 1980s rock blockbuster: the bold, brilliant, and misunderstood apex of Bruce Springsteen’s imperial era.","As the release of Born in the U.S.A. approached in spring 1984—and with it, one of the greatest commercial ascents in the history of popular music—Bruce Springsteen was feeling apprehensive. It wasn’t because of “Dancing in the Dark,” which he added last-minute after his manager convinced him to write one more surefire attempt at a hit. It wasn’t because of the title track, a booming anthem whose chorus could be misinterpreted as a rallying cry for Reagan-era jingoism. And it wasn’t because of the cover art, a photograph by Annie Leibovitz that could be mistaken for a man urinating on an American flag. It was because of a song called “No Surrender,” and, in particular, its final verse:Now on the street tonight the lights grow dimThe walls of my room are closing inThere’s a war outside still ragingYou say it ain’t ours anymore to winI want to sleep beneath peaceful skies in my lover’s bedWith a wide open country in my eyesAnd these romantic dreams in my headSomething felt off as he sang these words. Who could be so blindly optimistic? During the tour for Born in the U.S.A., which spanned 16 months and brought the E Street Band to the biggest audiences they had ever played, Springsteen tried retooling the driving arrangement as a tender acoustic ballad; he rewrote the verse and changed his delivery. By the end of the run, it only appeared sporadically in setlists. “It was a song I was uncomfortable with,” he wrote years later. “You don’t hold out and triumph all the time in life. You compromise, you suffer defeat; you slip into life’s gray areas.”So how did it wind up on the album? It wasn’t for a lack of material. Most casual fans know that as Springsteen was in the process of piecing together this full-band masterpiece, he first recorded an entirely different one: 1982’s solo acoustic Nebraska, originally intended as demos for the follow-up to 1980’s The River. But there was more where that came from. Before he landed on the dozen songs that would comprise his bestselling album, Springsteen continued down Nebraska’s folky path with story-song outtakes like “Shut Out the Light”; he worked with the band on epics like “This Hard Land” and straight-ahead rockers like “Murder Incorporated.” He wrote a goofy song about having his story told in a TV movie and a strange, apocalyptic one about the KKK. He is estimated to have recorded somewhere between 50 and 100 songs, hoping to amass enough material for one cohesive record."

It was a profile-raising breakthrough release for both the band and the Labrador label. But the band didn't exactly sound joyful about the whole situation: The record sounded reluctant and distantly depressed, and various interviews revealed their own distaste for the Internet and self-publicity in general.Sweden's Acid House Kings are another band on Labrador with an uneasy relationship to ambition, but they sound happier about what they're doing. The band, which features Labrador head Johan Angergård as a member, is back with its first LP in six years, Music Sounds Better With You. Like the Radio Dept. last year, AHK have returned after a layoff with their strongest-sounding record and a newfound vitality. The band's previous releases were low-key and shy-sounding-- when vocalist Julia Lannerheim first appeared on 1997's Advantage Acid House Kings, she sounded reserved and afraid to speak up. There's no stage fright here: the production is bright, the arrangements propulsive and peppy, and Lannerheim and co-vocalist Niklas Angergård sound confident in their newly strong voices.Considering how long the band's been doing this (20 years and counting), such an outgoing attitude is a little surprising. ""Maturity"" in popular music is sometimes associated with mellowing and settling down. Very little on this record scans a ""old,"" but the concept of growing up-- and how those shifts affect the way you live and love-- is a recurring theme. Lannerheim bemoans the 9-to-5 grind and wonders whether it's making her insane in ""(I'm In) A Chorus Line"", while on ""I Just Called to Say Jag Ålskar Dig""-- ""I love you"" in Swedish, of course-- Niklas sends a dispatch to his dearest from a business trip, wondering ""is it really me in the conference room?"" On the charmingly upbeat highlight ""Are We Lovers or Are We Friends?"", he caps a slow dance by admitting that ""I know I've held my hopes so high/ I almost forget that we're gonna die.""So one way to settle into adulthood is to fall in love-- with love itself, and with your record collection, too. Music Sounds Better With You is a mash note to a wide range of indie-pop-- alternately buzzy, peppy, shy, melodramatic, and grandly sweeping. Each approach is rendered with heart and never feels rote. That album title, it turns out, isn't a reference to the beloved Stardust song; it's about the joy that comes from creating music with others. Acid House Kings might be addressing the sentiment to each other and they might be addressing it to us, but either way, it rings true."

NBC’s cameras zoomed in on the late rapper’s picture until the living ones reappeared in the frame to play hypeman for their friend, their backs turned to the studio audience, egging on a static image.The performance was less than eight months after Phife, born Malik Taylor, had died from diabetes-related complications at the age of 45. In the nearly 20 years between The Love Movement and We got it from Here, Phife, dogged by ill health and still frustrated over the dynamics that led to Tribe’s breakup, released little music. Forever, his first posthumous album—assembled by his longtime DJ, Dion Liverpool, from largely unfinished demos—reveals what had become most important to Phife in his post-Tribe years: family and a particular kind of integrity, where teaching a child to read and not fucking up a cypher are interconnected parts of one worldview. It also shows a dexterous vocal style that is more easily transposed across eras than longtime listeners might have imagined.Phife and Q-Tip met when they were children attending the same Seventh Day Adventist church in Queens. But where Q-Tip was free to pursue his secular interests—his father was a jazz collector, and the opening verse to The Low End Theory recounts an informed back-and-forth about musical styles between father and son—Phife’s family adhered more strictly to the faith. He wasn’t permitted to hear hip-hop, much less participate in it, except in surreptitious doses outside the home. This is perhaps why, if Q-Tip could turn moodily inward or grapple with abstract social issues, Phife’s raps always felt more purely social. He was trying to intimidate or entertain, always playing to the block parties in his memory."

When local officials shuttered the space in the wake of the 2016 Oakland Ghost Ship fire, Johnston and her close friend Colin Ward were two of 15 local musicians displaced. A little over a year later, Ward died unexpectedly. The back-to-back losses left Johnston feeling suffocated by sorrow, disconnected from her community in a city that no longer felt like home. She immersed herself in the songwriting process until she resurfaced with Forever, a collection of candid, minimalist shoegaze that grapples with the impermanence of life.With the barren dream-pop of album opener “2018,” she surveys the year and forces herself to accept the truth, repeating, “This is really happening” until the words go numb. There’s always been an air of detachment to Midwife’s music—2017’s Like Author, Like Daughter sounds like anesthetized Grouper—but here she sounds trapped, stuck in the purgatory of grief. On lead single “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” which sounds nothing like the Radiohead song, a hazy wash of guitar floods the air as she lies flat on her back, fixated on the desire to outrun her life yet pinned beneath the minute hand of a clock. It’s the type of warm, melancholic drone you want to pull up to your chin like a weighted blanket, and she wisely follows it with “Vow,” a heartbreaking instrumental that spaces out its lone piano chords so each one falls like a teardrop.Midwife is the rare artist who can wallow in pain without indulging self-pity. She performs her own kind of therapeutic practice on “C.R.F.W.,” a nearly nine-minute sprawl that opens with a recording of Ward reading an original poem about desire and fate, originally commissioned for the 2011 collaborative project Pure Becoming. His recitation is empathetic, spiritual, spoken in a flat tone with no audience in mind. In the final line, he compares death to a falling leaf: “Imagine the way a breeze feels against your leaf body when you finally don’t have to hold on anymore.” It’s not the poem itself that’s so remarkable, but the way Midwife follows his words with ambient drone and tectonic synth hums, turning it into a moving homage that feels like a hypnagogic meditation on the possibility of an afterlife.Johnston calls her music “heaven metal,” and Forever is heavy and hypnotic, full of nearly wordless ruminations on the pain of loss. But while the album begins as an outlet for grief, it grows towards zen-like acceptance of death. Closer “S.W.I.M.” capitalizes on Midwife’s strengths—blown-out fuzz, lethargic percussion, a pop of melody that appears like a daydream—to mirror her lyrics: “Treading water my whole life/I don’t want to swim forever/Reaching for the other side.” Forever is first and foremost a tribute to Ward, but its strength lies in the power of Johnston’s singular experience to unlock communal knowledge: that the mourning process never really becomes less painful, but so long as it’s inevitable, we need not feel alone."

Man’s first video accused the 29-year-old Jamaican deejay of putting on false airs about his humble roots, and the follow-up diss track warned him against surpassing his place. In the past, Popcaan might have entertained a response, like the “Stray Dog” clapback when Alkaline took jabs at his masculinity. Now, though, he prefers leaving those badmind rivals on read. For Popcaan (born Andrae Jay Sutherland), asserting dominance over the Kingston microcosm is an unspoken flex: He lets the private jet, the gold chains around his neck, and a Midas-touch cosign from Drake do the talking. Landing a full four years after his summer 2014 debut Where We Come From, Popcaan’s second album peacocks the wealth of his international pop celebrity. Forever is an overflowing chalice, and he’s is overly eager to offer us a sip.In late June, the head of Unruly records described manifesting his destiny (in the form of high-profile collaborations with Jamie xx, Pusha-T, Gorillaz, among others) to radio host Zane Lowe, saying: “I keep my thoughts clean and positive.” Fittingly, Popcaan continues to boast his untouchable purity on Forever. The first song “Silence” contemplates the paranoia of fame, but gives reassurance: “And my heart clean, filled with love/And mi meditation sharp like studs.” His chief conspirator and Mixpak Records’ Brooklyn beatmaker Dre Skull makes an equally dignified return, imbuing the song with sonic gravitas through quickening thrums of bass and misty atmospherics. Spirituality is the current that electrifies Forever. On “Firm & Strong,” the glory of a 20-person choir shake stained glass windows with Popcaan’s soulful affirmations. The bookend “A Wha Suh” is a sincere pep-talk from a psalm-slinging confidant—only to be rendered banal by mid-range piano chords from step-in producer Not Nice.Each blessing Popcaan counts strengthens his carefree swagger. Rather than the accidental intersection of pop and dancehall that sprung from Where We Come From, his sinewy melodies and Dre Skull’s grooves here are more deliberate angles towards mainstream audiences. He claims this bid for the spotlight with the same rigor his soaring croons hurtle over the sparkly synth lines on “Superstar.” Framed within a rags-to-riches context, the singalong chorus, “Man a star, man a star/Man a super,” knows everyone cheers when the underdog punches the air amidst a thrilling recovery. Equally infectious is “Happy Now,” where Popcaan’s wavering ad libs undergo a slight AutoTune treatment, a correction very evocative of pop tradition.Forever falters when Popcaan confronts romantic limitations. At least the lusty rhapsodies on “Naked” and the cries of “Wine fi the money now” on “Dun Rich” own their irreverence. He barely musters a convincing lilt to carry the words “Girl you love me for free, yeah/This must be love” on the vapid “Through the Storm.” What’s worse is the cloying guitars in the background with a twang borrowed from sine feeble boy band 10 years his junior. Wrestling ballads away from weak sentimentalism requires a higher degree of finesse than assembling hip-swaying hits.Entering the big pop arena often comes with the question of superficiality, of watering down truth, or tuning up reality for the onlooker. The charisma underneath Popcaan’s veneer of wealth saves his work from feeling entirely contrived. However, like panning for precious metals, Forever requires sieving through plates of glinting sediment before discovering treasure. The album is best when luxuriating in its own divine intensity, when an earnest Popcaan reconciles the hunger of his past with the feasting of his present, hands clasped in grace."

The Pittsburgh savants—musical partners since high school, barely legal at the time of their 2012 signing, long barred from the club circuit due to their age—have certainly paid their dues. They’ve spent the past decade plotting and pummeling their way from the hardcore underground to rock’s MainStage, touring with everyone from Full of Hell and Touché Amoré to Deftones and the Misfits and recording under the guidance of two of the most respected luminaries in their genre. Their first two albums (2012’s Love Is Love // Return to Dust and 2014’s I Am King) were released on Converge frontman Jacob Bannon’s Deathwish Inc. label, and produced by his bandmate Kurt Ballou, one of metal’s most highly-regarded board wizards. And yet, even as they stay the course, the group continue to grapple with their precocious past, leading some to reframe them as interlopers, snooty art school kids trying to act tough.Certainly, Code Orange’s aesthetic and presence involve plenty of mean mugging: grisly music videos and artwork, on-the-record refusals to tour with acts they consider “bargain-bin deathcore bands,” unflinching accounts of in-studio fist fights, vows of Darwinist vengeance against the “fake rockstar mentality” espoused by scene hotshots like Asking Alexandra (“They will be the first to go,” the self-proclaimed “thinners of the herd” stated ominously in a Facebook post). With their third LP and major-label debut Forever, Code Orange have offered up compelling, caustic–occasionally, even catchy–evidence that their claims of intra-scene superiority are, for the most part, justified.Despite all this talk, the Code Orange crew's approach is surprisingly communal. There’s no bandleader to speak of; instead, we’ve got a vocal tag-team between drummer Jami Morgan and guitarists Reba Meyers and Eric Balderose, the latter of whom’s on power electronics duty as well. They’re less a trio than a cacophonous hydra fighting with itself, each head bearing a distinctive battle cry: Morgan’s razor-throated yelps and deadpanned raps; Meyers’ piercing shrieks, alternated with the haunting alto typically reserved for her pop-punk side project, Adventures; and Balderose’s guttural death growls. This multivalence is partially to blame for the album’s erratic atmosphere; rather than reconcile these disparate approaches, the band duke things out in turn, leaving the guitar hooks (and Joe Goldman’s unfussed, even-keel bass playing) to tie everything together. Sometimes, a twisted choir forms: the half-sung, half-shouted chorus of “The Mud” for instance, or the end of “Hurt Goes On.”"

However, its 39 minutes often run together.","A lot more goes into release dates than ""seasonal appropriateness,"" I realize, but Painted Palms' Forever sure doesn't feel like a January record. The long-gestating debut LP from the San Francisco psych-pop duo is a bright, spangling, decidedly summery affair, all radiant harmonies and warm reverberations. Forever's pleasures are simple, breezy, a little like bringing a parka to the pool: you're supposed to dive right in, not waste a lot of time peeling back the layers. Forever is lush, easygoing, 39 balmy minutes in paradise. But spend too much time in these all-too-pleasant surroundings, and you can't help but feel like you've been there before.Cousins Reese Donohue and Christopher Prudhomme planted the seeds of Painted Palms when the pair were separated by a dozen states, gradually building up tracks from the snippets they'd shoot back-and-forth through email. And, though they've both called San Francisco home for a number of years, Forever's shimmering construction is mostly in line with their earlier efforts. Like a lot of young bands, they're certainly not shy about their fondness for the Beach Boys and their legions of sonic followers; especially Animal Collective, and even more especially, Panda Bear's 2007 landmark Person Pitch. The Palms do have a few legs up on much of the not-exactly-thin post-Pitch crowd; their sound's fuller, the sense of melody better defined. And, in Prudhomme, they've got a singer who serves as their answer to Noah Lennox. On ""Too High,"" for instance, Prudhomme cuts through the track's radar-gun reverb with a swooping, choirboy-in-an-echo-chamber vocal line packed with the long vowel sounds Lennox favors. The similarities don't stop in Prudhomme's throat; between Forever's droning intros, distressed breakbeats, and prickly calliope-style keyboards, it's fairly clear just who these guys owe much of their sound to.Lyrically, Forever concerns itself with a lot of minor communication breakdowns: ""never ever said the things that mattered,"" ""she didn't understand that I was having trouble in my head."" And, in keeping with the music's endlessly summery vibe, the rest is pleasantly half-baked: ""look at my hands and look at the air,"" ""when I see the light,"" ""I can't tell if I'm high or low."" What there's not, unfortunately, is any sense of urgency, anything lending these songs much in the way of consequence or fervor. That ""never said the things that mattered"" line (from ""Soft Hammer"", Forever's most unadulterated Beach Boys nod) seems especially telling. These songs may be well-crafted, busy without being overcluttered, built around strong—if not particularly distinctive—melodies. But, since Prudhomme and Donohue haven't quite yet figured out how to assert themselves above their fairly obvious influences, where personality's concerned, they're a little lacking.Between the carefully plotted reference points and the not-exactly-gripping lyrics, Forever tends to run together over the course of its 39-minute runtime. Still, taken song-for-song, there's no shortage of takeaways: the bouncy ""Not Really There"", the ambling Atlas Sound-alike ""Carousel"", the late-LP one-two of the brash ""Spinning Signs"" and the tender ""Sleepwalking."" Donohue and Prudhomme certainly know their way around a melody, and their careful craftsmanship puts them a notch or two ahead of the oft-slapdash box-ticking of a lot of easily led up-and-comers. But, if they hope to keep it going through the next cold snap, Painted Palms still need to figure out a way to bring a little more of themselves to the party."

Going for broke, their sophomore LP Forever transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright and emotionally charged.","In Stockholm, there is no scene. At least, there’s no scene like they have in Copenhagen, a community centered around the boutique Posh Isolation label started in 2009 by Christian Stadsgaard and Loke Rahbek. This is the label that launched a thousand Danish hardcore post-punk bands and their synth-noise side projects like Sexdrome, Damien Dubrovnik, Marching Church, Lust For Youth, Vår, Lower, and Iceage-- all of whom share at least one or more members between them. Andreas Lagerström,the lead singer and bassist for Holograms, said in an interview earlier this year, “we have nothing like that in Stockholm. We really like Iceage [and] Lower but most of us didn’t know about them when we started.” Though, he did admit to talking with Iceage on MySpace “like, five years ago when they were like thirteen or something.”So there’s Posh Isolation and then there’s real isolation like what the young Holograms have experienced after a grueling and bank-breaking 2012 world tour. Returning to their homes in the night-swept winter of Stockholm with no jobs, no money, and no real scene to speak of, their only lifelines were each other. Add in the only six or seven hours of sunlight that Stockholm was getting in the winter, the backdrop for the band’s sophomore album Forever starts to come into focus. Even for hyperborean punk, things were dark. Given the circumstances, and their precedent for synth-heavy dourness on their self-titled debut, it would be understandable for the band to turn in an exhausted and slapdash placeholder until conditions improved, or at least until two of the band members stretched their legs and formed a synth-noise side project. Instead, the factory-floor post-punk quartet doubled down on their sound and literally went for broke, taking their fear and desolation and sending it out to near arena heights.Lead single, the corporeal “Flesh And Bone” served as a bellwether as to where the band was heading, but it was just the tip. Its Peter Hook bass line and down-stroked eighth-note guitars lead the album much like they lead the song-- Now they have more in common with the sharpness of Joy Division or even the thickness of Editors, and creep further away from the electro-punk or hardcore-punk of their Danish doppelgangers. Most remarkable about Holograms is how they transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright. Flying in the face of insular self-pity, they avoid all the trappings of isolation and turn it into 10 songs whose every syllable warrants a fist pump."

Here, leader Stefanie Franciotti gives equal prominence to both highly-textured songs and errant noise.","Austin's Sleep ∞ Over first appeared as a trio with a woozy pop 7"" on Forest Family last year. Since then, they've slimmed down to one member, Stefanie Franciotti, who returns with an upgraded full-length debut that plays like a shoegaze record for a generation reared on The NeverEnding Story.Franciotti's sound hinges on her dual interest in highly textured pop and errant noise. On the project's early tracks, those elements resulted in a sound that was aimless and a little soupy, if still pretty. Here, Franciotti is able to create a dynamic contrast by giving equal prominence to each, alternating between new wave-indebted slow-dance jams and experimental tracks that range in tone from sublimely ambient to jagged and far-out. This puts Franciotti in the company of Peaking Lights and Sun Araw, and while she's not as cosmically bent as either, she's making the same kind of escapist music that, at its best, can feel transportative.Ultimately, the album's song-oriented material is the most memorable. ""Romantic Streams"", ""Casual Diamond"", and highlight ""Stickers"" are peppered with space-age chimes and melting glissandos that feel grounded and organic. And despite all the machine noise, Franciotti's vocals feel approachable and human. Though her singing is sometimes unremarkable, at times sound like a slurry Hope Sandoval trapped in a bell jar (this is a compliment). At these moments, Forever's frozen lullabies provide mix immediate gratification with a hint of mystery."

Given the ever-shortening waiting period for nostalgia (hey, man, remember when the Patriots won the Super Bowl?) it's just a matter of time before the first ""hits of the 90s"" radio stations start popping up across the country. And when ""Seether"" starts rockin' the airwaves again, you better believe Verula Salt will be touring America's low-capacity venues, perhaps co-headlining with Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Jesus Jones.Nine years removed from their biggest hits, Cracker would seem to be state-fair circuit material themselves. Yet, to their credit, David Lowery & Co appear to be trying their hardest to avoid this fate and remain a vital, relevant act with their newest album, Forever. Of course, when your band's lasting image for most people is the lead singer boxing Sandra Bernhard, that's an uphill battle to be fighting.Cracker's secret weapon against obscurity, apparently, is to take refuge under the roots-rock banner, releasing Forever on the Virgin imprint Back Porch Records and wearing a whole lot of denim in the album art. While perhaps a further insult to hardcore Camper Van Beethoven fans desperately praying for Lowery to turn around his musical de-evolution, the choice at least reflects a purpose more thought out than, ""Hey, remember us? Please, please, please buy our new album!"" But roots-rock itself has always been something of a questionable cause, usually implying something along the lines of ""we're tired of experimenting; let's just make music that's already been made a thousand times before.""Save a few exceptions, that's mostly the vibe Forever projects, with the band (whittled down to a core of Lowery and guitarist Johnny Hickman) content to reside along a familiar country-rock-soul axis. You've got your acoustic guitar base, your occasional slide guitar fill, your Dylan-esque organ, your chug-a-lug drums, and your mildly catchy melodies. It would be offensive if it wasn't so obvious that Cracker doesn't aspire to much more than this rustic middle-America mediocrity act.Or do they? Mark Linkous returns the favor of Lowery co-writing the brilliant Sparklehorse anthem ""Sick of Goodbyes"" by producing the leadoff ""Brides of Neptune"" and tweaking Cracker's sound by throwing some eerie synth voices and a tinny drum loop into the mix. And while it's not quite Jim O'Rourke re-inventing Wilco, it is a compelling opening to the album. Hickman's lone solo composition, ""Superfan"", also augments the Cracker formula with an underlying drone and some ""Baba O'Riley"" violin, indicating that he's more than just Lowery's hired-gun soloist.But then again, experimentation also gives us ""What You're Missing"", a self-referential joke that painfully allows these Crackers to near-rap about their respective roles in the band. That sound you hear is Biggie rapidly spinning around in his oversized, solid-gold coffin. Humorous intention or no, can we please put a ban on white rock bands rapping?Elsewhere, Lowery's singing voice retains the same old one-dimensional, inflexible rasp which, given the uniformity of the music, works more often than not. Less successful are attempts to soften it with two-bit Sheryl Crow-ish harmony/backing vocals, which give ""Shine"" and ""Guarded by Monkeys"" a distastefully slick sheen. In fact, the album's overall polished countenance doesn't seem to jive with the band's supposed rootsy goals.So, no, Forever isn't the album that's going to rescue Cracker from the discount used bins and return them to radio prominence, but at the very least, it establishes them on the respectable side of the soon-to-be-oldies continuum: more our generation's Cheap Trick than our Doobie Brothers. And something tells me that's about all they're shooting for."

When she finally toured the album, “I almost felt like I had to force myself back into the Fake It Flowers world,” she said. On Beatopia, Kristi moves forward by retreating backwards, finding a brighter sound in the sanctum of her inner child.The title of her new record comes from the name of an imaginary world Kristi dreamed up when she was about seven. As a child, Kristi immigrated with her parents from Iloilo City to London, where she felt like an “alien” in a majority-white school. She found a much-needed escape in the invented alphabet, people, and places of Beatopia, but she blotted out her fantasy land after her teacher and classmates found—and roundly mocked—her grand escapist vision. It wasn’t until recently that Kristi rediscovered her lost world. Maybe it was the psychedelics she started taking in her early 20s, or maybe time had healed some deeper traumas, but as Kristi began drafting her follow-up album, her forgotten kingdom started to come back.To an outsider Beatopia might sound disjointed, but any fellow child of early ’00s pop radio will feel intimately at home with Kristi’s mix of adult contemporary and guitar-driven bubblegum pop. If her first album was an homage to the decade before her birth, all slanted guitars and screams and Sub Pop cosplay, this one is a send-up of the soft rock of her actual childhood: “Sunny Day” is relaxed and radiant, a bubbly echo of Norah Jones, Ingrid Michaelson, and Natasha Bedingfield. Paired with Kristi’s sly, lythe vocals, the shimmying bossa nova of “The Perfect Pair” is a vision of an internet-age Corinne Bailey Rae. “Talk,” with its compact percussion and smudged vocals, takes the canned one-hit-wonder pop-punk princesses of the 2000s and cranks up their levels. It’s an inspired and nuanced take on an era flattened by nostalgia: Kristi’s riffs are more explosive and her lyrics are stranger (“See You Soon” is supposed to make the listener “feel like you’re tripping on shrooms,” and her sighs of “I’m deteriorating” are an apt approximation). Where her source material is often facile or vindictive, these songs are restorative; “Fairy Song” sounds like a self-care checklist, with gentle reminders to drink water, eat food, and call your brother just to check he’s okay."

But preceding that chorus was a verse with a precisely observed snapshot of the moment one notices there’s nothing anymore where heartbreak used to be: “Polaroid of you dancing in my room… I think it was about noon/It’s getting hard to understand how you felt in my hands.” It’s a careful bit of writing belied by its hype, and an early indicator that Claire Cottrill’s heart lay in songwriting, not content production. And with a new EP soon after, Cottrill had already moved past it: “I’m hoping [Diary 001] can close off the bedroom-pop era of Clairo, and I can move on to some other things.” On her debut album Immunity, she proves this decisively.Immunity brings in new personnel—produced by Rostam Batmanglij, mixed by Dave Fridmann, assisted on drums by Danielle Haim—for a new direction. Clairo’s often compared to one of her teenage idols Frankie Cosmos, both for making lo-fi pop and for becoming entangled in some exhausting discourse about her father’s bankroll and industry ties. But where Frankie Cosmos’ spiritual precursor is college rock, Clairo’s, at least on Immunity, is soft rock. The uptempo tracks are breezy and chill; the ballads are lush and deeply felt. Reverb’d keyboards abound. Several tracks have children’s choirs, but—if such a thing is possible—subtle ones. The fit is surprisingly natural; she certainly sounds much more at ease here than on the likes of an earlier collaboration like “B.O.M.D.,” where Danny L Harle’s trop-pop fripperies sound in retrospect at odds with Cottrill’s plainspoken voice.Perils do lie this way; much of Immunity approaches the very sad, very posh, and very produced ballads of adult-contemporary drears like London Grammar or Låpsley. (“Feel Something” comes closest to this sound; not coincidentally, it’s the weakest cut.) But, crucially, the album only tiptoes up to the edge of huge production and no further. It’s truly remarkable how many of these tracks, if they were produced even one iota larger, would collapse into mush, and how much restraint it must have taken not to blow them up that big. Opener “Alewife” builds, but modestly: a recorder counterpoint, a little drum fill, some light guitar fuzz, less of a breakdown than a heart skip. “Closer to You” could have been easily overpowered either by the 808s and Heartbreak-style AutoTune on the verses or the power-ballad guitar on the chorus; it isn’t. The children's choirs and vocal processing on “I Wouldn’t Ask You” aren’t there to make the song swell but to dissolve away, leaving a sparse, almost hymn-like arrangement of piano, Cottrill’s un-vocoded melody, and nothing else. “Sofia” is powered by a “Dancing on My Own” synth chug—about the most surefire banger fodder there is—but one that remains in the background beneath crackly, distorted guitar (a late addition). The closest thing to trend-chasing is “Softly,” a Y2K pop-R&B ballad like something TLC or Mya might have recorded as an album track—which is far from bad."

But Immunity, the producer’s breakthrough fourth album, bounds and writhes with its own life force.","Jon Hopkins is a respected keyboardist and sonic technician who instills ambient music and acidic techno with a classical sense of composition, but he tends to work around the edges of things: He got started backing Imogen Heap. He’s played keyboards for Brian Eno, a clear influence, on albums such as Small Craft on a Milk Sea. Tagging along with Eno, he wound up co-producing and performing on Coldplay’s fourth album. He also created subtle electro-acoustic atmospheres for the Scottish singer-songwriter King Creosote on the exquisite Diamond Mine EP, and crafted an acclaimed string-based score for the British sci-fi film Monsters. It’s not a shabby cv, but it's not quite a name-making one, either.This habit of putting himself on the periphery seeped into his own albums—until now. Insides from 2009 was impressive but felt faintly impersonal, streaming by like dazzling but disconnected vignettes in a film. But Hopkins’ breakthrough fourth album, Immunity, bounds and writhes with its own life force. It’s looser and oilier, more limber and dangerous. The aggressive dance tracks darkly obliterate everything else, while the wet and sunny piano-ambient ones wash out into the sounds of wind, waves, and gulls. The latter is impeccably done on “Sun Harmonics,” where the boundary between electronics and coastal recordings dissolves.Lots of electronic music creates its own hermetic world, but on Immunity, Hopkins finds ingenious ways to let the world in. He created the album’s warm, alive feel by shunning digital perfection in favor of the analog synthesis of original sounds, both electronic and physical. The ambient prelude of the haunting, scrambled glitch-house opener “We Disappear”—a key unlocks the door of Hopkins’ London studio and his footsteps lead in—is more than idle window dressing: He is ushering us into the tactile space that suffuses the record. He drums on desks, plays salt shakers, slows down serendipitous recordings of nearby fireworks, boosts the kick-drummed rattle of a window. On “Form by Firelight,” which sounds like Kanye West’s “Runaway” remixed by Wolfgang Voigt, Hopkins processes beats and melodies right out of the piano, tapping the pedals and striking the strings. Spacious, with carefully shaped resonance, its delay-flickered counterpoint shows off Hopkins’ classical background.This emphasis on our admission to a physical space naturally makes us feel like we have privileged access to Hopkins’ private emotional space as well. Immunity is said to be inspired by the arc of a night out, and whether or not that matters to the listener, it gives the album a holistic pace and flow, from heroically hurtling along on molten bass synthesizers to hovering gorgeously on gathering ambient breezes. Around the monstrous dancefloor anthems “Open Eye Signal” and “Collider”—the first oozing forward in anticipation, the second climactically crashing down at sharp threshing angles—there is the lyrical ambient landscape of “Abandon Window” and the cunning merger of both styles in “Breathe This Air.” The title track, with a trickle of legato piano turning a rickety rhythm, brings back King Creosote to add discreet vocal colors for a dreamlike conclusion. It all adds up to a remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record that stays absorbing from beginning to end, and should finally catapult Hopkins to stardom in his own story.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

To fans, he’s a decidedly unpretentious singer-songwriter with a wacky sense of humor. His extracurricular gross-out antics—getting naked in videos, sticking a drumstick up his ass onstage—are evidence that he doesn’t take himself or the world too seriously, and is someone who rightly thinks rock music has room for the fun and silly. To his detractors, these stunts are at the very least an annoying mark of an archetype—the lazy, mugging, unshaven, drifting-through-life slob à la Bill Murray in Stripes—that has worn out its welcome in the 2010s. DeMarco’s actual music is chill, loping, slightly goofy, slightly druggy, and sometimes seemingly half-asleep, which is to say, it has such a clear relationship to his persona that it amplifies the reaction to his persona. You have to take the whole thing—the guy who shows up in videos and onstage, and the person singing these songs—together.At this point, a radical change-up for DeMarco would be weird—he’s got his style, it works, and he’s sticking with it. But This Old Dog, DeMarco’s third album, does show some signs of growth. Compared to the two records before it, the new album is less cluttered, never using two words when one will do, and generally going easy on the woozy guitar effects. There’s more acoustic guitar and less processing, which frees it from the post-chillwave context of his earlier music. For a guy who seems to live life off the cuff and in the moment, his music feels more timeless.This approach brings to mind singer-songwriters of an earlier era, particularly iconoclasts like Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, and JJ Cale. The title track brings to mind Little Joy in its unhurried and confident sense of swing, and DeMarco’s natural warmth and weariness shine through. “Baby You’re Out” tumbles beautifully through its chord changes like a soccer ball falling down a stairwell that manages to hit every fourth step. “One Another” twinkles like an earlier generation’s soda jingle, with a little slouch that invites finger snaps with every backbeat. If 2 brought to mind a dank basement, the best songs here throw open the windows and let in the sunshine.The move to a more “classic” sound suits DeMarco’s music, and it’s also a reminder that what at first glance seems like laziness might actually be brutal efficiency. On a casual listen, DeMarco seems to kick back and let everything fall into place, but his music demonstrates a relentless devotion to craft, with all the fundamentals intact. Each melodic shift, every turnaround on the chords during the choruses, every bridge—all are exactly where they should be. Even though they are not derivative, you swear you’ve heard them before because they show such a proficiency for songwriting structure."

In fact, those forward trajectories are made up of millions of tiny spirals—routines followed, patterns performed, habits fallen into. Most days are slightly deviating copies of one another, with periodic breaths of novelty. On their debut full-length, Jinx, New York City psych-rock band Crumb give shape to the ambivalence and hypnosis of those lulling spirals, bending indie rock and jazz influences to shape a clear-eyed perspective tinted amber with dirt. Beckoning the listener with dreamy keyboards, twinkling guitar, and a recognizable buzz of stoic anxiety, Jinx rewards with the promise that within the dizzying haze are moments, turns in direction, worth waking up to.Crumb formed in 2015 while the group’s members attended university in Boston, and their first, self-titled EP realized songs that guitarist, vocalist, and lead songwriter Lila Ramani began writing as far back as high school. Crumb and 2017 follow-up Locket, both misty and meandering, cast the four-part group as the new kid on today’s jazz-influenced psych block, among bands like Tame Impala and King Krule. On Jinx, those free-jazz influences and arrangements—an affinity Ramani also flexes as a member of New York City experimental collective Standing on the Corner—remain, but there’s something decidedly murkier afoot. Embracing the analog-suffused production they dabbled in on past projects, Crumb’s debut offers a warm, hazy snapshot of banal existence from the inside out.Concealed emotion, strained facades, and the desire to break free from the numbness underlying both are recurring themes, but Jinx is no dense, depressing slog. Languid love song “Ghostride” sets a scene of passive action as Ramani, voice wavering at a dispassionate hum, observes her subjects moving through the world on autopilot. A moment of hope emerges as guitar and drums break to a higher register and she breathily sings, “Come on now/Don’t let this go/Don’t let the light fade away/People come/And people go/But I—.” With a shade of hesitancy, she cuts off the sentiment, not finishing until the chorus repeats with the final word, almost a pronouncement: “stay.” That longing for cloud-parting connection and devotion peek out through the album’s rises and falls.Crumb have a knack for entrancing the listener, only to then displace them with airy, twinkling release. Flashes of silence—abruptly muted guitar strums, complete rests—and Ramani’s penchant for spell-like repetition can warp time, one hallucinatory spiral suddenly interrupted by another, more promising one. The album’s hypnotic quality grows ever more romantic and tense with repeat listens, a prescient-feeling experience that matches a zeitgeist: strung-out maintaining in the face of impending doom. “This city is dense/And it makes me tense/And it makes me tense/And it never ends/And it never ends,” Ramani sings, her voice recessed by a gauzy filter, on “And It Never Ends.” How do we get off the eye-glazing treadmill of the day-to-day? In lieu of tidy answers, Jinx offers a sympathetic fellow witness to the mystery.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Weekend are making lucid, pop-conscious moves.","When you release a record like Sports, the 2010 debut from San Francisco ex-pats Weekend, the smartest thing you can do is tour the hell out of it. Tapping into a strain of noisy, shadowy post-punk, it succeeded largely because of its texture. Carried on waves of serrated guitar, it was not only bracingly cathartic on headphones, but captivating, malleable, and very loud on the stage. Weekend did wisely tour it extensively, recording only a five-song EP,  Red, in the three years since. Some of the material on Red reflected the image of a band whose ears might need a break; though it still sounded like the work of the guys who gave us Sports, it hinted at a cleaner, glossier update of their sound.On their second LP, Jinx, Weekend are still working with a strong palette of blacks and grays. But where Sports' only light was the mineral glint of smeared charcoal, Jinx has a reflective, acrylic gloss to it. Expanding from a trio to a four-piece after hiring bassist Nick Ray, frontman Shaun Durkan moved his band to Brooklyn in the wake of a family death that found him seeking therapy. Still bleak, but surprisingly spirited and indebted to new wave, this newfound clarity and change of scenery has had an impact on the band: Weekend have put together a record that's begging to be played to more ears in bigger spaces. Like their arena-goth forebearers the Cure and Depeche Mode, they're making lucid, pop-conscious moves, focusing on melody and cleaner sonics to contrast the doubt, melancholy, and occasional tenderness already present.During Jinx's hook-minded first half, Weekend nearly pull off the transformation. With its buoyant low-end and surprisingly straightforward guitar work, opener and first single ""Mirror"" is an obvious indication of Weekend's commitment to reshaping their sound. While the torrents of noise are missed, Durkan and company prove that they have the songwriting chops to make up for it. ""July"" is a step further in the right direction, managing to capture the balmy freedom of summer's favorite month without alienating what could be the track's core constituency. It only takes a few listens for choruses to open up, with ""Oubielete"" pulling off a rare trick in that it sounds like a lost 1980s college radio staple that, despite not having been heard in years, feels like it never went away. (You could say the same for the big-beat anchored ""Celebration, FL"", but it's more likely thanks to the fact that it just sounds like a really bummed-out cover of ""Just Can't Get Enough"".)"

We don't care about anything. We don't even care ...,"Us Generation X'ers never gave the world shit. We don't care about anything. We don't even care about ourselves. We blew through our dotcom cash and we're still stuck with our student loans. Our biggest political moment was turning Ralph Nader into a presidential spoiler. And now, justice comes swiftly knocking. It is time to face that which we fear the most: the second coming of Lollapalooza's grunge-rock all-stars.Recent days have seen the re-emergence of an eerie number of megacelebrity has-beens-- from Jane's Addiction backing Courtney Love on tour, to Krist Novoselic joining forces with Meat Puppeteer Curt Kirkwood in Eyes Adrift-- combining their powers in the hopes of forming one mightier superbeast. And yea, we have seen these bands and known our sins, and the discipline was just and fair. But repent we did not. And so, as further castigation, we now find ourselves faced with the ultimate grievance: Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell assuming vocal duties for Urban Outfitters politicos Rage Against the Machine. Let the punishment fit the crime.The story goes that sometime after Zach de la Rocha dropped out of Rage, Cornell agreed to be the new singer, so long as they ditched their political bent and changed their name. And based on the evidence, losing the politics doesn't hurt the music: as Cornell proves here time and again, he can still voraciously belt the most inane lyrical tragedies with such conviction that you'd almost think they meant something were it not for such giveaways as, ""Pearls and swine bereft of me,"" and, ""Heaven waits for those who run/ Down your winter and underneath your waves/ Where you watch and wait."" It's also amusing to note that after years of playing the hardcore leftist, overeducated liberator of jailed antiheroes, Tom Morello gladly dropped the message from his music in lieu of playing venues that don't hang their name on a Schlitz sign.Bassist Tom Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk fall in line, but it's Cornell that's made a bitch out of all of them-- from forcing them to cancel a slot on the Ozzfest bill, to sticking them with the most asinine bandname of the year. (It was Cornell's idea to dub this bloated masturbathon Audioslave, and the name says everything with the same exacting precision that it says nothing at all. Audioslave. It's like it was tailor-made for a Sam Goody voiceover.) It's kind of incredible how slick and lifeless the Rage band sounds without de la Rocha spitting all over everything. The guys just autopilot their way through the most generic hard rock possible behind Cornell's Dio-like wailing about highways and death and more highways. Morello tries to stick out with his wanky solos, but all his effort amounts to little more than an indulgent novelty."

On AM, the quartet, now based in Los Angeles, offer a paranoid, haunted collection that goes beyond the sweaty clubs and furtive flirts into the hotel rooms, after parties, and bad decisions that can follow.","Their first record was called Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not—a Nevermind the Bollocks–type sendup of the generation-defining Self-Titled Debut Album as well as a bratty act of defiance from four Yorkshire youths drunk on their own twitchy cleverness. Their fifth album is called AM, and those mountainous initials stood sky-high behind the band as they preened and stomped like proper rock stars through a headlining Glastonbury set earlier this year. Their face-shrouding hair and brown hoodies are out; greaser streaks and bespoke suits are in. And the same band that once aimed its sights at windbag poseurs on “Fake Tales of San Francisco” is now based in Los Angeles. These changes have caused some to question Arctic Monkeys’ commitment to their initial no-bullshit ideals. But the quartet isn’t giving into the mindless grandeur of rock’n’roll as much as they’re working within its confines to mine new territory; over the last eight years, as they’ve gone from spastic punk, to doomed stoner rock, to sparkling guitar pop, to this new album’s skinny-jeaned funk, Arctic Monkeys have stayed close to the spirit of their debut’s title while minimizing its excess at the same time.Meanwhile, singer and lyricist Alex Turner has moved from syllable-stuffing chronicles of indie nightlife culture to songs that are sleeker, more blue-black, more self-lacerating. Thematically, AM centerpiece “No. 1 Party Anthem” comes off like a seedier take on Arctic Monkeys’ breakout track “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor” as it tells of a collar-popped lothario on the prowl in a dank club made up of “lights on the floors and sweat on the walls, cages and poles.” But instead of blaring, this anthem is wistful, its piano, acoustic strums, and croons suggesting days gone by (along with ’70s Elton John and Rod Stewart). Its swirling bridge sums up the scene in just a few choice phrases—“The look of love/The rush of blood/The ‘she’s with me’/The Gallic shrug”—and sounds like a definitive endnote to Turner’s most notable songwriting style.So AM goes beyond the sweaty clubs and furtive flirts into the hotel rooms, after parties, and bad decisions that can follow. The crux of the record is neatly summed up by the hook to the blistering “R U Mine?”: “R U mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?”—an entire world of sex and love and desire distilled to quick-hit text-speak that Drake could appreciate. Turner isn’t sure of the answer to that question, and the resulting limbo does his head in all over the LP. He’s an avowed romantic living in an unromantic world, grasping for meaning in a city-to-city road-dog lifestyle hellbent on repelling it. In some ways, Turner’s struggle and his band’s recent gleaming transformation into something like rock gods is reminiscent of U2’s turnaround circa Achtung Baby, when that quartet traded in deep virtuousness for sin, rhythm, and leather jackets. For Arctic Monkeys, loosening the tether to credulity can be freeing, allowing the band to live out their classic-rock dreams: T. Rex bop, Bee Gees backup vocals, Rolling Stones R&B, and Black Sabbath monster riffage are all rendered modern throughout AM with the help of longtime producer James Ford. And for Turner in particular, the switch has him connecting strings of desperate 3 a.m. thoughts: some horny, some bleary, some a bit frightening."

It's easy to get on one's soapbox and suppose that people want mediocrity. I mean, how else are we to explain the success of a musical Steve Guttenberg such as M. Ward? One can argue that when it comes to music, the public tends to applaud a certain kind of consistency, with records that sound familiar. But that's of course a false dichotomy. And while none of us would easily deny fame and influence, some artists simply choose the roads less traveled (if I may be allowed to make a high school poetry reference rather than a grad school one).Blau-- who's one-third of supertrio D+ (alongside Bret Lunsford from Beat Happening and the aforementioned Elverum) and who's worked with Mirah, Wolf Colonel, Nate Ashley, the Microphones, and Little Wings-- certainly seems more interested in winding backroads than interstates. The Anacortes, Wash.-based singer-songwriter is kind of like Kevin Ayers with a work ethic. A strong advocate for all-ages venues, his own monthly record service (Kelp!) sends CD-Rs and LPs directly to fans. He may re-record a Microphones album or collect field recordings. His entire shtick might be precious and trite if the work weren't also so straightforward and excellent.Blau's delightful new record is called AM. Actually, it's not that new. Having originally released it in a more stripped-down form as a CD-R via his monthly record service Kelp! in late 2006, Blau started on this album after he finished work on 2006's Beneath Waves. ""As B.W. was a live with band album for the most part, I took some time to record by my lonesome,"" Blau explains via email. The album meanders from anxious and droney tunes such as the hurdy gurdy (or is that melodica?)-plus-guitar feedback opening number ""Morning Prayer"" to laid-back folksy groovers like the drawling last track, ""In the Morning"". The latter song has all of the charm of the least angsty and full-throated songs by Kurt Cobain. Speaking of the 1990s, ""Yellow Sunbonnet"" sounds like the drunken demo version of some forgotten grunge hit, while the playful xylophone on ""Growing Up"" sounds like Skip Spence doing a pop-punk tune backed by second graders.I'm not sure if it qualifies as a concept album, but three of the songs on AM have the word ""morning"" in the title. And then two tunes have the word ""bird"" in the title, which is apparently something one hears if one is to awaken early, the sound of birds. I personally am a late riser, but I love the idea of the morning. So does Blau, who writes that ""AM was written and recorded in the wee hours of the day to reflect beginnings: spring, childhood, morning."" And AM has multiple meanings, too: ""I adopted and adapted several poems-- one paragraph actually from a Winnie the Pooh story-- by A.A. Milne. I was reading his work to my daughter at the time of recording this; it hit me that this was very much in the vein of what I was doing with the music.""Again, this enterprise would be so fucking twee if almost anyone else did it. I hasten to add that it's entirely possible to listen to this without being aware of the song's origins. It's not like there's a cover of Loggins and Messina's ""House at Pooh Corner"" or anything. And musically, it owes no debts to either Belle or Sebastian. Instead, it's a messy experimental folk-pop album of songs recorded in the bedroom before the artist was fully awake. It's awesome."

Really. Mostly because I was a Green Day fan, but also because of the soul-numbing run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, one of those rare moments when even those wary of politicized art wouldn't mind some big-time act addressing the evils of those pissing on us from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Any pop cultural port in a liberty-eroding shitstorm, and all.Two listens in, though, and it was clear: American Idiot was musically dodgy and politically empty. Political pop has its place, at least when didacticism doesn't drain the wit and life from a band's songwriting. But American Idiot failed utterly as coherent propaganda and as rock invigorating enough to agitate the pleasure centers. Have you tried to parse the lyrics to ""Holiday"" or ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" lately? This wasn't anti-imperialist dissent set to kick-ass. It was gaudy, way-too-impressionistic, self-congratulatory garbage warbled over lumbering AOR dressed in strings and conceptual malarkey.The fact that American Idiot had an undercurrent of lukewarm liberal backslapping, and was released during the blackest days of the W. era, certainly gave it a big contextual profile boost at the time. But what really assured its success was the fact that the band had smartly made a grab-bag of proven gestures swiped from the ignoble history of Big Rock, along with some earnest, commercially canny self-cannibalization. And then there was the icky transparency of the band's attempt to shuck their lingering entry-level pop-punk rep, the last of the slack-and-proud generation to reveal their sad, predictable need for ""boomer respect.""When a record like that sells a bazillion copies, you can be assured that the band won't be scaling back its ambitions on the follow-up. And 21st Century Breakdown is indeed another hour-plus slab of jumped-up alt-rock as political/musical theater-- overlong, exhausting, and corny as hell.If American Idiot was an aesthetic failure, you certainly never doubted the band's conviction. Sure, you might cringe when you realized all that effort was in service of fulfilling Billie Joe Armstrong's dreams of merging boneheaded pogo-pop with Broadway shlock. You might have lamented that no one pointed out the inanity of many of the album's creative choices, like naming a protagonist ""Jesus of Suburbia"", perhaps because Armstrong was a grown-ass millionaire with carte blanche from his corporate masters. Nonetheless, the band really put its backs into that vapid, humorless trash.21st Century Breakdown is just as pompous and dumb, but it lacks even that old misguided passion. It's a slog, but not the kind that results when a band forgets the importance of editing when in the throes of ""trying to say something."" Its sprawl feels entirely unearned, three men worried about meeting expectations rather than driven by urgency. The performances are blandly professional, because any major-label rock band of Green Day's abilities could shit this stuff out in their sleep, and emotionally inert. This is the crafting of a modern epic as a dreary day-job routine."

I say ""last"" because Keane's debut album, Hopes and Fears, is so miserably and calculatedly maudlin that it almost seems capable of killing the trend started by Travis and passed like a relay baton to Starsailor and, eventually, Snow Patrol. Coldplaya-hatas will loathe Keane; most others will just be insulted. Inexplicably, the band was recently shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.Keane consists of three well-meaning guys from East Sussex: drummer Richard Hughes, pianist Tim Oxley-Rice, and singer Tom Chaplin. With this limited instrumental setup, Keane ought to sound like either some bizarro-world version of Ben Folds Five or that pick-up band that played your cousin's wedding. Whether those options would be better than what they actually sound like is up for debate.Oxley-Rice does attempt to salvage the wreck by channeling U2 circa-""New Year's Day"". His piano forms the main melodies, and combines with Hughes' drumwork to form a technically competent rhythm section. The almost minimalist approach of these two could potentially have served as the foundation for a mildly compelling-- or at least passable-- album, one closer in spirit to the chilled-out ambience of this album's only not-horrible track, ""Untitled 1"". The problem is Chaplin, who sings as though he's trying to talk you down from a ledge (and failing), belting out tunes with all the bombastic earnestness of James Walsh and Fran Healy combined, but no sense of subtlety or melody.Every song on Hopes and Fears soars, as if winging a gossamer wind to scale the heights of heaven and touch the cloudy hand of God. Across the span of 11 tracks, there are maybe 13 triumph-of-the-human-spirit choruses, each trying to out-uplift the previous. ""Bend and Break"" is particularly egregious: ""If only I don't bend and break,"" Chaplin wails as the chorus swells to bursting, ""I'll meet you on the other side/ I'll meet you in the light.""Silly as the lyrics are, they might have more impact if every other song on Hopes and Fears didn't work the same melodramatic, soft-verse/loud-chorus template with the predictability of a bad xFC-metal band (or if Chaplin didn't repeat more or less the same sentiment each time). Writing such dramatic melodies undeniably takes talent, but putting so many of them back to back takes not only a penchant for repetitious banality, but a particularly rampant egotism: Not since All That You Can't Leave Behind has a band tried quite so hard to change your life."

The Red Hot Chili Peppers don't seem to be likely candidates for any of the above, having spent a two-decade career trafficking in progressively diluted funk songs about California, sex, and having sex in California. Then again, they've given their record the preposterous pseudo-Latin title of Stadium Arcadium (what's next, a music review book called Thesaurus Musicarum?), so maybe the shirtophobic quartet is ready to let their art-rock flag fly.Probably for the best, that's not the case; through two-plus hours of music, the emphasis here is on the Stadium. Like many of their peers from the heady peak of alternative rock-- your Grohls, Cornells, and Billie Joes-- the Peppers have eased into a comfortable life traveling down the middle of the road. Kiedis, Flea, & co. can even stake a truly rightful claim to the territory now christened Adult Album Alternative, having practically induced labor on the genre with the mega-hit ""Under the Bridge"" and their subsequent string of ever-so-slightly askew mid-tempo pop. Fitting examples abound on Stadium Arcadium, catchy tunes that will ensure a long tenure for the album at the front of the store. The band's sin, however, is one of self-denial: If the Red Hot Chili Peppers have pretty much mastered a marketable style, why bludgeon us with an unwieldy and inconsistent approach for 1/12th of a day, nagged by an annoying tendency to detour through affirmations of their technical talent and loyalty to funk-rock?It could've been worse, as the sessions that led to Stadium Arcadium reportedly yielded enough material for a triple album. So the band has shown some ability to self-edit, but not enough to save the record from typical double-album bloat, the islands of good tracks floating amidst the should-a-been B-sides. Conveniently-- or perhaps subconsciously-- the set is still front-loaded, with the first disc containing most of the highlights, like the expertly paced sunset anthem of the title track or the one-peak-after-another rave-up of ""Torture Me"".But sprinkled throughout the first disc, and coming to a head in the second, are products of the band's compulsive need to tip the light-bulb hat to their younger selves, most notably half-baked funk tracks ""Hump De Bump"" and ""Warlocks"". Whereas poor production values and drug-fueled exuberance once excused their George Clinton worship, 20 years on, in Rick Rubin's sterile environment, the band sounds like they're in jamband training camp, filling in all the empty spaces with blippityblap reminders of Flea's virtuosity and John Frusciante's desire to use every effects pedal ever invented (potentially the primary motivation for making this a double album)."

Their tracks come loaded up with burbling synth arpeggios and other ""futuristic"" effects intended to announce the band's modernity. But the music is firmly ol' skool at heart: proggy hard rock that forgoes any pretensions to restraint. What Muse lack in chophouse showmanship on the prog side of the equation they attempt to make up for in volume-- their songs use full-stacked guitars and thunderous drums to evoke god's footsteps. It's the kind of deep-fried, flash-frozen crud that can be ridiculously fun to listen to.Black Holes and Revelations is the band's fourth album*,* and if you thought by now they'd be getting tired of purveying the same old closet-geek space jams (or at least of critics accusing them of pillaging Radiohead), you'd be wrong: This is the band's most autopiloted effort yet, a hacked-up last-gen rehash of said space jams, only now with greater emphasis on glitz and glam. Somehow Muse, always loveably lame, have managed to take a turn for the lamer.I've heard a number of people refer to Muse as The Best Live Band in the World-- even a few who aren't British (just Anglophiles). I've also never seen Muse live, but after hearing opener ""Take a Bow"", I wouldn't discount the claim: It's the kind of song that could level an arena. But on the stereo, lacking the colossal volume of amp towers, the song fizzles.A celestial arpeggio opens the track ""Baba O'Riley"" style, while singer Matthew Bellamy yawns something indecipherable in his best and brittlest Yorke yowl. When, after a few false starts and nearly three minutes, the curtain finally lifts, there isn't much to see-- just an ominous two-note bassline and flares of upper register guitar occasionally harmonizing with Bellamy's wallpapery vocal. Drummer Dominic Howard fills the wide gaps between guitar chords and plodding downbeats with flailing triplet rolls, the still-going arpeggio snapping everything neatly to grid. But damned if Muse aren't going to cause an earthquake with every downstroke.""Map of the Problematiqué"" is the chest-thumping espionage movie chase-scene cut that beverage mogul and dope-ass party thrower Moby tried to make with his Bourne Identity theme song ""Extreme Ways"". It's the album's eurotrashiest and best song. ""Invincible"", while beatific, rips Jeff Buckley's version of ""Hallelujah"", Bellamy mimicking that song's cadence pretty much turn for turn. Not even a lasershot Kravitzesque guitar solo can mask it. The album really starts to flag around ""Exo-Politics"", which figures it doesn't need a hook because it asks a tough question: ""When the Zetas fill the skies,"" Bellamy wonders aloud over Sabbathian guitar plod, ""will our leaders tell us why?""If the album opens with its best camp, perhaps it's no mistake that it ends with its worst. ""Knights of Cydonia"" begs to be taken off on a stretcher and sprayed down with liquid novocaine like a histrionic Italian midfielder. The song opens with stampeding stallions and laser blips before moving into a galloping 6/8 drumbeat slathered in mariachi trumpets. Bellamy buttresses his reedy falsetto with some crafty ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" double-tracking, belting, ""No one's gonna take me alive."" The climax? A nauseating barrel-rolling guitar solo, possibly ripped from the soundtrack to a bad teen movie involving a stolen jet fighter.What's most difficult of all to look past is that Black Holes was created in all earnestness by three dudes in Hot Topic shirts advancing a vision of rock music that operates on three fundamental assumptions: 1) distortion is always better than no distortion; 2) every measure of music should contain at least one drum fill; and 3) the future will be dominated by robots. Muse leave no room for compromise on these points. So for peace of mind, call them retro, because they can't reasonably consider such a vision inventive or resonant in 2K6. Can they?"

You know, where the album has a pleasing ramshackle feel under the surface-level skillfulness, the sense that the vocal acrobatics or tricky instrumental interplay could suddenly veer into uncomfortable, mock amateurish expressionism.By contrast, you never get the sense that Muse are anything less than in total control of their ""difficult"" music at all times. Throughout The Resistance, frontman Matt Bellamy is ready and willing to foreground his chops, be it tickling the ivories, hopping octaves, or tossing out increasingly tasteful solos. If the The Resistance is ""about"" anything, aside from the conceptual malarkey encoded in the lyrics, it's about mastery, ego-security, etc. It's the kind of all-caps, no half-stepping ART-ROCK that closes with a three-part mini-epic so shameless about its own classic rock bigness that it's billed as a ""Symphony"", complete with ""Overture"". Jumped ship yet?For the wary or outright dismissive, however, The Resistance is also a very smartly sequenced album. it opens with the most ""pop"" sequence of the band's career, a three-song sequence aping the stadium-grade synth-rock of Depeche Mode at their crossover height. It then segues into a middle section of hard (but not too hard) rock, nodding in the direction of grottier bands like Queens of the Stone Age or System of a Down without stripping away the sparkle. Only then does The Resistance shift into the sort of fist-pumping, kitchen-sink prog you were probably expecting. It's canny: Leading the uncommitted down a drum machine paved path of catchy 1980s revivalism and straight into the path of an army of kids straddling the gap between entry-level classical and ""Headbanger's Ball"".And ""army"" is right: Unity in the face of faceless post-industrial society grinding down beautiful stuff like love and friendship is perhaps Muse's great theme. Bellamy is constantly tossing out mass-shout-along-ready lyrics like ""we will be victorious"" and ""they won't stop breaking us down."" Songs get titles like ""Uprising"" and (natch) ""Resistance"". Things break down easily into a ""we"" (rarely does an ""I"" creep into Bellamy's songwriting) and a ""they."" Your age-old, rock-standard good (we, the fans) vs. evil (them, the nebulous straight government-corporate nexus) set-up, got it?But unlike the creepy mass-rally overtones that so bugged early rock critics about music designed to pack civic centers-- or thrilled them when it was punk leading in the kids in revolt-- you get the sense that Bellamy's lyrics are an outgrowth of wanting to make his music as big and inclusive as possible, rather than any inchoate political impulses. No doubt Bellamy fancies himself some sort of social crusader, but his mush-headed vagueness (like Bono and Chris Martin and just about any Brit frontman operating on this scale) is designed to inspire warm fuzzy feelings of togetherness and resistance rather than offer any ten-point plan to overthrow the emotionally fascist modern world."

Dropping the transparently hayseed act, the band could have turned an artistic corner; yet the first single from Only By the Night is called ""Sex on Fire"", so if there was any debate about whether Kings of Leon are in on their own joke, I think it can be put to rest. If we're misreading them, we're missing out on one corker of a comedy album based on an ""SNL""-level premise: What if Bono got lost in the Blue Ridge Mountains and was replaced by a local yokel? (Suggested band name: Y'All2.)But even the move from ""southern Strokes"" to ""southern U2"" is way better in theory than in practice-- these are the same clunky Kings of Leon songs, just now presented in an incredibly weird context. It all starts with Caleb Followill's never-ending need to play to type, and if you've kept up to this point, you know the drill-- though his band has toured the world several times over, dude can't see past his own dick. He sings terribly on Only By the Night, any modicum of youth and young manhood compromised by ""real talk"" overemoting and an accent that seems to have no geographical origin.But why go on when Followill is more than happy to hoist himself on his own petard, doling his typical mix of stock characterization, open misogyny, and bizarre non-sequitirs. You can hear the brooms sweeping as the lonesome guitars of ""Revelry"" attempt some sort of last-call poignancy, but it's spoiled from the time Followill opens a mouth full of Meatloaf-- ""What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancin' machine/ With the fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene."" This goes on before you get the dominant KoL ethos on the chorus: ""With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain/ See the time we shared it was precious to me/ But all the while I was dreaming of revelry."" It's basically ""The One I Love"" with no riff and no irony.Meanwhile, ""Sex on Fire"" turns out to be disturbingly literal, while the dopey travelogue of ""Manhattan"" has Caleb waxing with the naïve enthusiasm of a senior yearbook quote: ""We're gonna set this fire we're gonna stoke it up/ We're gonna sip this wine and pass the cup/ We're gonna show this town how to kiss these stars,"" and it's nearly impossible to stifle your laughter when he punctuates each verse with a smarmy soul-papa ""I SAAAAIIIID!""  All that's missing is the attendant video where Caleb walks the NYC streets and gives dap to passers-by while the band taps away at their idea of funk. You'd figure ""17"" would be right in their wheelhouse, because what's a better Kings of Leon topic than underage pussy? But after the first line (I'll spot you ""Winger"" as a hint and let you guess what it is), it just sort of trails off, leaving the last memorable moment of an album that still has about 20 minutes to go."

The Red Hot Chili Peppers don't seem to be likely candidates for any of the above, having spent a two-decade career trafficking in progressively diluted funk songs about California, sex, and having sex in California. Then again, they've given their record the preposterous pseudo-Latin title of Stadium Arcadium (what's next, a music review book called Thesaurus Musicarum?), so maybe the shirtophobic quartet is ready to let their art-rock flag fly.Probably for the best, that's not the case; through two-plus hours of music, the emphasis here is on the Stadium. Like many of their peers from the heady peak of alternative rock-- your Grohls, Cornells, and Billie Joes-- the Peppers have eased into a comfortable life traveling down the middle of the road. Kiedis, Flea, & co. can even stake a truly rightful claim to the territory now christened Adult Album Alternative, having practically induced labor on the genre with the mega-hit ""Under the Bridge"" and their subsequent string of ever-so-slightly askew mid-tempo pop. Fitting examples abound on Stadium Arcadium, catchy tunes that will ensure a long tenure for the album at the front of the store. The band's sin, however, is one of self-denial: If the Red Hot Chili Peppers have pretty much mastered a marketable style, why bludgeon us with an unwieldy and inconsistent approach for 1/12th of a day, nagged by an annoying tendency to detour through affirmations of their technical talent and loyalty to funk-rock?It could've been worse, as the sessions that led to Stadium Arcadium reportedly yielded enough material for a triple album. So the band has shown some ability to self-edit, but not enough to save the record from typical double-album bloat, the islands of good tracks floating amidst the should-a-been B-sides. Conveniently-- or perhaps subconsciously-- the set is still front-loaded, with the first disc containing most of the highlights, like the expertly paced sunset anthem of the title track or the one-peak-after-another rave-up of ""Torture Me"".But sprinkled throughout the first disc, and coming to a head in the second, are products of the band's compulsive need to tip the light-bulb hat to their younger selves, most notably half-baked funk tracks ""Hump De Bump"" and ""Warlocks"". Whereas poor production values and drug-fueled exuberance once excused their George Clinton worship, 20 years on, in Rick Rubin's sterile environment, the band sounds like they're in jamband training camp, filling in all the empty spaces with blippityblap reminders of Flea's virtuosity and John Frusciante's desire to use every effects pedal ever invented (potentially the primary motivation for making this a double album)."

This being overwhelmingly the case, I will try my best to transport with words, and paint a picture of another time-- a time ever so slightly more innocent, when terrorism wasn't being used as an excuse to crush civil liberties and drop bombs on mustachioed megalomaniacs. So, drag that bottle of Orbitz out of the back of the closet, put X-Files on the VHS, and journey back with me to the year 2000.It was a wondrous time-- we were still fascinated by the three zeros that had signified the birth of the new millennium, and many were relieved to have escaped judgment from an infinite, intangible being. Then, toward the end of the year, we began to hear rumblings from the many-headed hydra of UK rock journalism that some amazing new music had come to usher us into the New World. This music was deemed fascinating, uncompromising and utterly prizeworthy by our English brethren, who spoke in hushed tones of how it was to be the coming of ""the next Radiohead,"" or perhaps more tellingly, ""the next Travis.""This new music was produced by a band of four affable blue-collar lads from Europe's island neighbor who called themselves Coldplay, and before you knew it, there was no escaping their lead-off single, ""Yellow"", as it burned itself into the national consciousness via extensive radio exposure and ABC promotional spots. I, myself, was never too taken with that single, though I openly admit to enjoying the album it was culled from, Parachutes. It was innocuous, to be sure, but it was also honestly rendered, and the opening three songs, effortless and hummable as they were, were hard to deny.Two years and a veritable avalanche of press later, A Rush of Blood to the Head has Coldplay taking a second shot at it, and to be perfectly honest, what they throw at the wall doesn't stick quite as well. I will credit them where it's due: they've admirably eschewed cloning their debut album, a path that would have been all too easy to take given that record's critical and commercial success. But while the sound of this album is more expansive, the influences a bit less obvious, and the approach more varied, the guys forgot to tote along their initial strength: the songs.Atmospherically, a couple of these tracks are remarkable-- particularly ""Daylight"", with its swooping guitar and synth lines. Even its strings, which echo melodies from Suede's last album, lend a sense of drama to a song that otherwise wouldn't hold much. Midtempo non-rockers ""Green Eyes"" and ""Warning Sign"" stretch the most obvious thread back to Parachutes with their lovelorn lyrics and slightly more developed melodies. And there are also a couple of ""memo to listener: we can rock, too!"" moments, specifically ""A Whisper"" and the lite-apocalypse of opener ""Politik"". The latter essentially takes the blueprint of ""Yellow""-- namely, the slamming, repetitive strumming of clean electric guitar-- and builds a more spacious song from it, one with more rattle and hum, but less melodic substance. Martin's double-tracked vocals hover curiously low in the mix and the band thrashes earnestly, but all the listener really comes away with is a nebular dustcloud and the sense that Coldplay want to break out of their box."

Really. Mostly because I was a Green Day fan, but also because of the soul-numbing run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, one of those rare moments when even those wary of politicized art wouldn't mind some big-time act addressing the evils of those pissing on us from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Any pop cultural port in a liberty-eroding shitstorm, and all.Two listens in, though, and it was clear: American Idiot was musically dodgy and politically empty. Political pop has its place, at least when didacticism doesn't drain the wit and life from a band's songwriting. But American Idiot failed utterly as coherent propaganda and as rock invigorating enough to agitate the pleasure centers. Have you tried to parse the lyrics to ""Holiday"" or ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" lately? This wasn't anti-imperialist dissent set to kick-ass. It was gaudy, way-too-impressionistic, self-congratulatory garbage warbled over lumbering AOR dressed in strings and conceptual malarkey.The fact that American Idiot had an undercurrent of lukewarm liberal backslapping, and was released during the blackest days of the W. era, certainly gave it a big contextual profile boost at the time. But what really assured its success was the fact that the band had smartly made a grab-bag of proven gestures swiped from the ignoble history of Big Rock, along with some earnest, commercially canny self-cannibalization. And then there was the icky transparency of the band's attempt to shuck their lingering entry-level pop-punk rep, the last of the slack-and-proud generation to reveal their sad, predictable need for ""boomer respect.""When a record like that sells a bazillion copies, you can be assured that the band won't be scaling back its ambitions on the follow-up. And 21st Century Breakdown is indeed another hour-plus slab of jumped-up alt-rock as political/musical theater-- overlong, exhausting, and corny as hell.If American Idiot was an aesthetic failure, you certainly never doubted the band's conviction. Sure, you might cringe when you realized all that effort was in service of fulfilling Billie Joe Armstrong's dreams of merging boneheaded pogo-pop with Broadway shlock. You might have lamented that no one pointed out the inanity of many of the album's creative choices, like naming a protagonist ""Jesus of Suburbia"", perhaps because Armstrong was a grown-ass millionaire with carte blanche from his corporate masters. Nonetheless, the band really put its backs into that vapid, humorless trash.21st Century Breakdown is just as pompous and dumb, but it lacks even that old misguided passion. It's a slog, but not the kind that results when a band forgets the importance of editing when in the throes of ""trying to say something."" Its sprawl feels entirely unearned, three men worried about meeting expectations rather than driven by urgency. The performances are blandly professional, because any major-label rock band of Green Day's abilities could shit this stuff out in their sleep, and emotionally inert. This is the crafting of a modern epic as a dreary day-job routine."

As the fresh writers swapped customized iPod skins and debated the cultural impact of Xiu Moo, I counted passing silos while listening to worn Britpop mix cassettes and neurotically rubbing the growing bald spot on my scalp.

Now, it's no secret that, when it comes to rock's metal edge, these Queens want badly to be kings; you need look no further for proof than 2000's blistering, thuggish Rated R, on which frontman Josh Homme's searing guitars and theatrical vocals brought the band close enough to their goal to sniff the fleurs de lis. That, however, is history, and with Songs for the Deaf, the Queens have hit a new peak in their development: the sound is more massive, the chaos is more calculated, and with hired gun Dave Grohl at the kit, the band has an unprecedented drive that leaves them poised for their strongest bid for power yet.""You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire"" embodies the greatest strengths of rock at its hardest-- stunning riffs, breakneck speed, and guitars that churn and spit like a threshing machine. It's riddled with decades-old metal cliches, but the Queens know what their audience expects, and they use this knowledge to continually twist rock stereotypes into a vicious full-nelson until they beg for mercy. It's fantastic, and this is just the first track.""No One Knows"" changes Songs for the Deaf's pace by sliding into an easy groove, sleazing its way across a dimly-lit bar, half-drunk and reeking of cheap cologne, to put the moves on your girlfriend (or, you know, you, depending). This is four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality, folks, and it's the second installment in this album's triad of genius, completed subsequently by the next track, ""First It Giveth"". ""Giveth"" brings the drama like a champ, with Homme singing in pained falsetto over punishing riffs during the verses, and opening up into aggro-overdrive for the appropriately apocalyptic chorus.But along the path to greatness, there are pitfalls, and one Homme often falls into here is the old ""chamber of lost souls"" effect (made popular by Alice in Chains on some of their later albums), which he uses to fill out the backgrounds of some of these songs. The multitracked Hommes aaah'ing melodramatically in undead unison make slogging through ""Hanging Tree"" and ""Go with the Flow"" a pretty grim endeavor. It doesn't help that these songs churn along interminably long after their riffs have run dry, either. And worse still, the band has quit winking at their metal excesses entirely, toeing the line between mindless fun and xFC-metal gothery. Fortunately, this is only a temporary decline, but that these two tracks hit back-to-back in the dead center of the record makes for a much steeper dropoff than if they'd been sequenced farther apart."

Her second album, Romance, follows the same pristine pop cues of her 2018 debut Camila and imbues them with a vision about love so universalized it blurs it out of focus.There’s love and there’s the performance of it, and Cabello is motivated by both. A Spotify playlist called “The Romance Experience,” interspersed with spoken tracks in which the 22-year-old singer discusses the experiences of love, sex, and heartbreak that inspired the album, sums up the album’s conceit: to explain a familiar experience rather than trust you to feel it yourself. Romance is to romance as Rory Gilmore is to journalism; its depiction is a simple kind of complicated, punctuated with acceptable failures, a simplification that reassures you that your life might be better if you were more beautiful and moral.This illusion is part of Romance’s appeal. And there are many genuine glimpses into Cabello’s experience as a young woman navigating love and sex within that fantasy. She succeeds in tracks that capture love’s fleeting minutiae. “Shameless” begins as a hesitant statement, the flashpoint at which a young woman steps out of herself to embrace love’s abandon. The howl of her refrain—“Show me you’re shameless”—is equally a challenge to oneself as it is to another. By “Cry for Me,” a bright spot on Romance’s fizzling second half, Cabello is long past the point of shameless, leaning into a self-love that demands someone else’s tears in place of her own.The trouble comes when Cabello seems obligated to cover the waterfront of love songs rather than push further on any one feeling. Her effortless “that’s funny” over twinkling acoustic guitar on “Should’ve Said It” feels written for a different project than “Living Proof,” which is driven by the stomping rhythm of stylized female empowerment à la “Fight Song.” Even when motivated by a compelling story, like the guilt of harboring feelings for someone else on “Bad Kind of Butterflies,” the song itself often doesn’t match its pain or power.Though the album’s biggest song, “Señorita,” inhabits Cabello’s real-life relationship with Shawn Mendes, it’s of a piece with 2017’s “Havana,” a similarly Latin-influenced jaunt. Just as the “Havana” video was structured around a regular girl’s dream of starring in a telenovela, “Señorita” stars a waitress who dreams of a bad boy in a leather jacket. But the flirtation at the surface of “Havana” veiled nostalgic romance for a birthplace signaled in each note. “Señorita,” which also appeared on the deluxe version of Mendes’ self-titled album this year, is a harmless gesture toward Latin-ness for exotic effect, rather than a needle-mover. At worst, this impulse results in Ed Sheeran’s “South of the Border,” on which Cabello featured this year: a pastiche of disembodied “Brown eyes/caramel thighs,” misplaced flutes, and Cardi B’s “You never lived until you risk your life” that points to the underlying callousness of the music industry’s embrace of the “Latin” sound. Cabello’s willingness to assist in its caricature elsewhere distracts from the otherwise interesting Spanish-classical and Santana-esque riffs on Romance."

Their 12th album, Romance, explores new ground yet again, literally and metaphorically, as an examination of where one fits in the tumult of suddenly inhospitable environments. Across 11 tracks clocking in at 72 minutes, Romance offers a comprehensive yet concise survey of the best of Oneida’s vast and varied catalog—transfixing ambient loops, expansive krautrock jams, and even straight-ahead rock, while taking less time than ever to get to the point.Romance blossoms within the social, spatial, and economic confines of New York’s constantly morphing music culture. For better or worse, Oneida’s story is tied up with a rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn, where cultural institutions (and this band is An Institution) foster the very energy and excitement that attract the forces conspiring for their downfall. From around 2006 until 2011, the band called the Monster Island complex on the Williamsburg Waterfront home. Long before 285 Kent or Death By Audio, Oneida was woodshedding there for hours upon hours in their dedicated studio the Ocropolis. Romance has only remnants of two tracks recorded there, with the rest spanning a variety of locations in New York and one in Barcelona.Losing their dedicated space seems to have forced the band into a new mode of introspection, where they don’t ruminate on ideas quite as obsessively as in years past. Romance is their most chiseled effort since the mammoth 2009 triple-album Rated O, possessing a mode indelible to Oneida, one of strong self-awareness, an intimacy both immediate and lurid, and—most importantly—loads of fun. The hilarious and raucous “Cockfight” takes a barebones ultimate punk riff, atop which singer Hanoi Jane sounds like he’s sparring with a hell-raising alter ego. It is an honest-to-goodness moving song, particularly the sudden coda of swirling electronics.Whether the Romance referenced in the title is that of love, actually, or the imagined, Wildean lifestyle of The Artist, is still up for debate. But the band zones in on vocals and lyrics in a new way that offers a narrative of language, and, perhaps, a manifesto: “Repetition is resistance,” chants Bobby Matador on the hazy, heady “Reputation.” There are also plenty of Romantic motifs to explore, here, where cedar groves offer metaphors for patience (“Cedars”) and murders of crows hover over the entire affair (“It Was Me”).Opener “Economy Travel” transforms a classic repeated psych organ riff into an abstract, fractured colossus, perhaps a loose metaphor for the hierarchy of experimental music cultures. Here, a Kung-Fu “grasshopper” implores an elder while placed quite literally underground, “Beneath the lava/Beneath the crust.” The repeated phrases are disrupted by impossibly heroic drum fills, made that much more impossible by double-tracking Kid Millions in stereo. The split-stereo technique is repeated on “Lay of the Land,” another expansive track that subsumes to a swell of guitar, ebbing in like an evening tide and storming out like a tsunami.The first real semblance of groove comes three tracks in, on the three-minute “All in Due Time,” where a motorik beat propels billowy synth over a vocal lament on things happening as per the title. “Good Lie” is a surprisingly gentle, Wayne Coyne-inflected meditation on saving face. Moreover, there is no bitterness to Romance. There are occasional flurries of rage and anger but Oneida confronts what comes to them head-on.Their closest kin these days spreads throughout the New York diaspora, with shades of endurance-jam champions the Psychic Paramount, and corollaries to the many directions taken recently by Liars (not for nothing, Oneida and Liars did a 2003 split). But there’s still something so very Oneida about Oneida. The band’s last appearance on record, the 2016 Northern Spy release with Rhys Chatham, What’s Your Sign?, cemented them in an echelon of avant-minimalist outliers. But Oneida are the rare experimentalists who can hammer away at a riff or idea incessantly and somehow make it really last."

Today, we revisit a slice of hyperactive, politicized nu-metal from 2001.","Toxicity came out one week before September 11th, 2001. Its lead single, “Chop Suey!,” famously landed on a Clear Channel blacklist of songs to avoid broadcasting in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center. “Chop Suey!” contained the word “suicide,” so it joined Dave Matthews Band’s “Crash Into Me” and Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” on a roster of tracks that might conceivably remind listeners of the recent national trauma.“Chop Suey!” became a hit all the same, a nu-metal chimera that crashed unintelligible babbling into the chorus’s gorgeous vocal melody. One minute Serj Tankian’s shucking syllables like pistachio shells, saying nothing; the next he’s appealing to the Lord God Himself in a rich, reverent baritone, singing the words Jesus spoke to his father on the cross: “Why have you forsaken me?” The bait-and-switch between abrasion and allure makes the song irresistible, a songwriting tactic that would elevate System of a Down from the glut of hard rock that occupied a sizable portion of pop radio through the turn of the millennium.Raised in Los Angeles’s Armenian-American community, all four members of System of a Down were primed to see through the myth of American exceptionalism that would justify the coming warmongering of George W. Bush’s presidency. Their families had survived the Armenian genocide under the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century; they grew up in the United States with ancestral scars from a massacre still officially denied by its perpetrators, which lent them keen eyes for political suppression and internal propaganda. It’s as if their position as ethnic outsiders in one of the largest cities in the U.S. contributed to the atypical configuration of their sound.System of a Down released their debut self-titled album toward the end of Rage Against the Machine’s tenure as rock radio’s crowning political agitators. Like RATM, SOAD interpolated West Coast hip-hop’s quick vocal clip into a guitar-driven metal milieu. But SOAD’s compositions disoriented as much as they elucidated. Tankian’s wild, flexible delivery spun out of control. Guitarist Daron Malakian didn’t drive home the beat of their songs so much as he threw it into disarray. Malakian and Tankian forged a close chemistry on the band’s 1998 self-titled debut, whose cover image of an open hand referred to a World War II anti-fascist poster designed by a member of the Communist Party of Germany.Tankien, Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan played with the weight of metal, but the quick pivots of their compositions also aligned them with L.A.’s hardcore punk heritage. Political without dipping into preachiness, they accumulated fans who could either tap into the radical messages of their music or easily ignore them.

I see you, Master of Puppets people, but I’ve strapped on the blindfold of Lady Justice and let the scales tip where they may: Justice wins. The songwriting of singer James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich is their most complex and vicious, retaining the power of their early thrash while jettisoning its simplistic schoolyard chants and avoiding the less-compelling hard rock tendencies to come. Use, abuse, experience, and enough beer and Jägermeister to make Keith Moon drive a luxury car into a swimming pool had tempered Hetfield’s reedy yell into something fuller and more forceful, with none of his later cigar-chomping bluster. The lyrics are a ground-level portrait of bureaucratic order pushing down on people too powerless to fight back. And the sound is nearly industrial in its ear-killing intensity, a piece of serrated steel designed to carve you and leave its nihilism in the wounds. Oh, and maybe you’ve heard this: You can’t hear the bass.In celebration of its 30th anniversary, Justice has been remastered and re-released in a variety of formats—from a three-disc reissue with bonus material to a six-LP, four-DVD, 11-CD monstrosity that features a hardcover book of photos and liner notes and is stuffed with enough prints, patches, and assorted swag to fill a Christmas stocking. Three decades later, Justice arguably stands as the only Metallica album that’s as beloved as it is controversial. (The rest tend to skew one way or the other.) After the death of original bassist Cliff Burton in a 1986 bus accident, the band hired Jason Newsted as his replacement. They toured with him, recorded a covers EP with him, gave him moments in the spotlight on stage, and... absolutely buried him in the mix of Justice, his first-full length with Metallica. The result is the most abrasive-sounding album to sell over eight million copies ever. It’s as if, instead of adding canned crowd noises or fake room tone, Metallica preloaded it with tinnitus.Newsted’s absence from the final mix is easy to explain, if not excuse. Some of the factors are innocuous: The three original members and the newcomer were not yet accustomed to each other’s playing styles, which led Newsted to track his basslines mostly to Hetfield’s rhythm guitar. Hetfield himself aimed for a low, pulverizing sound, eating up much of the range Newsted’s bass might have occupied. But reading the accounts of various producers, mixers, and engineers included in this set’s extensive notes suggests a more direct, less savory explanation: The bass isn’t there because the band, namely Ulrich and Hetfield, didn’t want it there."

It’s the pinnacle of goth populism.","Who the fuck is that guy with the ZZ Top beard, Glenn Danzig pondered, and what’s he doing going crazy backstage at MY show? It was a sweltering night in July of 1986 in lower Manhattan, and Danzig had just stormed the stage of the Ritz with his beloved goth rock band Samhain. (The show was part of industry conference New Music Seminar.) You’d think the pasty-faced prince of darkness would be in higher spirits, happy to soak up all of Samhain’s hard-won praises, just as he’d done with earsplitting horror-punk progenitors Misfits earlier in the decade. Instead, lurking backstage just three years after launching his supposedly definitive project, the erstwhile horror punk found himself feeling restless and insatiable.That’s when Danzig got around to talking with the mysterious beardo he spotted backstage earlier in the night. This much-hyped rap producer and label owner was one Rick Rubin. He’d come to the Ritz in search of talent for his Def American label; at the previous year’s conference, he’d discovered his inaugural signees, Slayer. He saw immense potential in Danzig and offered to sign him—provided the frontman cleaned house. “I don’t want any of these old guys,” Danzig recalls Rubin telling him. To Rubin’s ears, “[bassist] Eerie [Von Danzig] can’t play; the drummer can’t play.” His interests were pointed: “I never liked the Misfits,” he said. “All I want to do is sign you.”Remarkably, Rubin’s backhanded compliments resonated. Danzig was up for pressing the reset button on Samhain—but only if bassist Eerie remained, and only if Rubin could convince drummer Chuck Biscuits (D.O.A., Black Flag) to sit behind the kit. The producer honored both requests, but insisted Danzig fire guitarist Pete “Damien” Marshall; John Christ eventually took his place. In 1988, Samhain 2.0 staged their triumphant return under a new name—the frontman’s own, so as to avoid royalty lawsuits—and released a self-titled album. Danzig is a thunderous debut that sharpened and streamlined the preceding project’s moody, blues-rock aesthetic without dialing back the darkness. Consider it the pinnacle of goth populism.Danzig’s strength stems from his devilish voice: a deep, coarse, serpentine croon that fills the space from the bottom up, like a deluge of poisoned honey. Rubin rightly establishes the frontman’s vocals as Danzig’s true north, alongside pared-down arrangements that treat guitar riffs like samples. It makes Danzig’s primal energy all the more fearsome by contrast. Consider the wailing lick Christ doles out on the chorus to “Soul on Fire,” just after Danzig vows revenge on a cold-hearted “devil girl”—it’s not so much a performance as it is an aural exclamation point, a clever instrumental extension of the frontman’s not-so-subtle gravitas."

The Black Album’s dark, muscular sound would permanently alter the course of heavy music.","June 29, 1990: Deep in the guts of Toronto’s CNE Stadium, four shaggy, sweaty, booze-swilling horsemen of the apocalypse are hatching a cultural coup. James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich, and Jason Newsted just opened up for Aerosmith, their childhood heroes. Judging by the muffled roars emanating from the arena, Steven Tyler’s got the world wrapped around his finger. The same will be said for Metallica within a year’s time. They won’t settle for anything less than a supervillain death grip.Granted, Metallica’s approach up to this point has proven hugely successful, a byzantine war machine powered by a spartan tactic Ulrich will later outline to critic David Masciotra as simply: “not fucking up.” Judging from their generous album sales, sold-out tours, Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental Grammy nomination, and hard-won laurels despite crickets from the establishment, “not fucking up” should ensure that their wallets remain as stuffed as the arenas.But these are the guys who gave us Kill ’Em All; they won’t stop until they’ve slayed Poison, Mötley Crüe, Ratt, and every last one of those platinum-blonde, spandex-wearing false heirs to the heavy metal throne with their own weapons: massive riffs, clean vocals, sharp arrangements, and layered mixes that gush from the speakers like knife wounds. They’ll even tap Bob Rock—the man behind Bon Jovi’s Slippery When Wet, an anti-Metallica album if there ever was one—to ensure the heist goes off without a hitch.Naturally, Metallica will name this declaration of war and independence after themselves. It’s the best-selling album of the past 25 years, with currently over 20 million copies sold worldwide, more than Bruce Springsteen’s Born In The U.S.A. or Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side Of The Moon. Even if you handed out three Black Albums to every citizen in Ulrich’s native Denmark, you’d be left with a warehouse full of CDs. Few bands have achieved such ubiquity so that if you know literally one thing about metal music, it is the six-note opening riff to “Enter Sandman.”Though Metallica were neither unknowns nor underdogs when they recorded their fifth studio album Metallica, the status quo as dictated by music critics, disc jockeys, and MTV framed them as such. Throughout the ’80s, Metallica and their Big Four peers—Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax—challenged metal’s emergent portrait of pomp by way of extreme fundamentalism. In her 1992 book Heavy Metal: A Cultural Sociology, Deena Weinstein compared thrash metal to the Protestant Reformation, framing it as a reaction to corruption: “Both movements [the Reformation and thrash metal],” she wrote, “charged that the established form had become corrupt through extravagance, and both supported a return to the essential message, stripped bare of all adornment.”"

The term appeared printed in 1863 in Story of a Lancashire Thief:""Brummagem Joe, a cove [""fellow"" or ""dude,"" if you will] as could patter or pitch the fork with anyone.""At last, the secret motivation of my schtick and the etymology behind our name can be revealed. These reviews have been less critique than loquacious concept reviews by an entertaining tramp. So you'd think an 80-minute opus by Tool would be right up our alley. You'd be wrong.Undertow, Tool's 1993 debut LP, took studio skill and over-trained chops to metal with aplomb. It was Rush Sabbath. As emotional, melodic metal goes (the cultural impact of which will be left to the reader), it opened doors for bands like the Deftones, and to some degree, Limp Bizkit. However, Tool have always possessed a latent understanding of absurdity and comedy; their videos look like Tim Burton stop-motion, goth Primus.But with popularity and praise, Tool's shadowy tongue-in-cheek turned into the simple biting of tongues. \xC6nema spiced their sound with electronics and industry, as was the trend at the time. Now, with the early new century demanding ""opuses,"" Tool follows suit. The problem is, Tool defines ""opus"" as taking their ""defining element"" (wanking sludge) and stretching it out to the maximum digital capacity of a compact disc.Dictionary of the Underworld also offers several definitions for ""tool,"" including: ""a small boy used to creep through windows,"" ""to steal from women's pockets,"" and ""to loaf, to idle, to do nothing in particular."" All of which oddly strike the nail on the head in relation to Lateralus.And now, the obligatory pitching of the fork.My Summer Vacation, by Crispin Fubert, Ms. Higgins' Eng. Comp. 901I believe that music comes and goes in cycles, and some of us are lucky enough to ride the crests. The men in my family are perfect examples of this. Initially, I thought that perfect music appeared every 16 years, which is also the number of years between Fubert generations. My dad was born in 1971. In that year, landmark albums were released. They were Nursery Crime by Genesis (the first with Phil Collins), Yes Album by Yes, Aqualung by Jethro Tull, and In the Land of Grey and Pink by Caravan.My grandfather skipped out on Vietnam-- because Jimi Hendrix himself told him to-- and he moved to Canterbury, which is in the United England. There, he got married to my grandmother, who used to sell baked goods to people at concerts, and they had my dad. After the war, they moved back with a box of awesome records like the ones I mentioned. I think it was cosmic or fate or something that my dad was born the same exact day Chrysalis released Aqualung, in March of 1971."

She grew up in Napanee, Ontario, a small town best known for its proximity to the country’s largest highway and its selection of fine truck stops. She sang Pentecostal hymns in her family’s church and performed in local productions of Godspell and You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. It was little more than an average, provincial life.When the nearest big-city country station held a singing contest, a 14-year-old Lavigne sent in a tape for a chance to sing with none other than Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop superstar. Lavigne didn’t just acquit herself: She won the damn thing, which meant driving two-plus hours to the nation’s capital and belting Twain’s brassy 1993 hit “What Made You Say That” in front of a packed Ottawa hockey arena. At the time, Lavigne told Twain she wanted to be “a famous singer.”Lavigne had no idea how quickly her dream would come true: Within a few years, she’d be sneering on the cover of Rolling Stone in a black tank top and a curt plaid skirt, winkingly labeled “the Britney slayer.” The onetime country-pop princess who performed hits by Faith Hill and Sarah McLachlan at an early record label audition had become a gleeful anarchist, a pop-punk supernova who skated through videos for hits like “Complicated” and “Sk8er Boi,” causing chaos in ratty T-shirts and neckties. She wasn’t disingenuous or calculating; she was a teenager, one whose formative experiences and changes in taste were taking place while she navigated the expectations that come with a major-label record deal. The reaction between Lavigne’s volatile energy and the music industry’s commercial imperative produced her 2002 debut Let Go, a rebuttal of Spears-Aguilerian pop—overtly sexual, vaguely urban, hyper-processed—churned out by the exact same kind of hit factory. It boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.While Lavigne’s ascent from local radio contests to the top of the charts seems rapid in retrospect, her career took shape in fits and starts. Nine months after she appeared on stage with Twain, Cliff Fabri—the manager who shepherded her through the earliest phase of her career—watched her sing country karaoke in a Kingston, Ontario Chapters, the Canadian equivalent of being discovered in a college town’s Barnes & Noble. “I was thinking of her as another Sheryl Crow. They both had the same small-town roots,” Fabri told The New York Times in 2002. “Then I was thinking Fiona Apple, because of her independence. She definitely had attitude. So my line was Sheryl Crow meets Fiona Apple.”"

Like the equally mystifying continued existence of their pan-flash peers Superdrag (sigh, WhosuckedouttheFEEEELAAAAAANNNNN!!), Nada Surf insists upon fading away rather than burning out. So now, they're dropping down to the minor leagues and trying to ignore showgoers' wiseass heckles as they tour America's low-overhead venues. If you're anything like me, there's a little voice inside of you saying, ""Dude, weird, they're still around? Shouldn't they be headlining the John Deere Alternative Rock Stage at the State Fair by now? Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so long outlived their original fifteen minutes?""Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little voice, who never did you no good anyhow. Let Go's only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds. Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny.Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say  the DB's and  The Replacements-- that'll suffice. All well and good, but the band also carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays.Said crimes include:Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"".Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the protagonist listening to Blonde on Blonde in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"".Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?).Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats.But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous ""Treading Water"". Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on Let Go, are gleefully shined into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to ruining albums by both Pavement and Phish.Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps. I'll admit, though: If forced to defend one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought. No, I'm afraid Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with Let Go, and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired."

You could get a month-long jolt of artificial energy from just one helping of their self-titled first disc, or the follow-up, Utopia Parkway; syrupy harmonies, magnetic power-pop chords and the occasional dopey keyboard riff have been the group's bread and butter since day one, and it's served them well. Long after other groups have lost the knack for tongue-in-cheek couplets and catchy chord progressions (what have you got to say for yourself, Rivers?), Fountains of Wayne have kept the formula close at hand, and served up some tasty dishes as a result. Songwriter Adam Schlesinger wasn't tapped for the soundtrack to That Thing You Do for nothing, and the pop sensibilities of teen sensations The Wonders infuse much of FoW's latest opus, Welcome Interstate Managers.As soon as the seconds start ticking and the guitar starts strumming on ""Mexican Wine"", you know what you're in for: fuzzy guitars, big Warner Bros. drums, and the gravelly voices of Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood, which hang out somewhere between Wayne Coyne's raspy tenor and the boat the British Invasion came in on. Throw in a delicate Beach Boys castanet, and you've got a killer opening number. Indeed, ""Mexican Wine"" is the biggest rocker on the record. To be fair, the first single, ""Stacy's Mom"", aims for king of the hill, but its routine pacing keeps it from breaking away from the pack-- even if the crystalline harmonies during the chorus are worth noting.As it just so happens, it's the duo's vocal harmonies that end up being the biggest boon for Welcome Interstate Managers, and no cut here makes this clearer than ""Hackensack"" (the couplet ""I saw you talkin'/ To Christopher Walken"" helps some), which highlights Schlesinger's 50s pop fixation while also encompassing jangly guitar and dreamy crooning. And ballads like ""Valley Winter Song"" and the upbeat, acoustic ""Hey Julie"" might find themselves dead in the water without their clever vocal pairings-- the kind Fountains of Wayne have falling out their back pockets. Even when the instrumentation gets stale (""Little Red Light"" and the Ben Folds Five redux ""Fire Island"" are prime offenders), the creamy, chocolate-covered melodies are there to offer up a little redemption.I like TastyCakes. They're sugary, they're bad for me, but I like them. I wouldn't eat a boxful of them in one go, though; too much of a good thing, as someone who's probably dead once said. That's the biggest problem with Welcome Interstate Managers, and in many ways the entire Fountains of Wayne catalog. I don't fault the band for being disposable; on the contrary, these guys are so in love with being disposable that you can't help but have fun. Even if it seems unlikely that you'd ever be driving through the 'burbs with the windows down, singing ""Stacy's mom/ Has got it goin' on,"" I assure you it'll happen. And although the lyrics to ""Halley's Waitress"" are nothing less than moronic, the 70s power ballad trappings are straight-up masterful."

Today, we revisit a teenage fever dream, the mainstream pop-punk debut of Avril Lavigne.","Avril Lavigne’s origin story would be the perfect American fairytale if it wasn’t so undeniably Canadian. She grew up in Napanee, Ontario, a small town best known for its proximity to the country’s largest highway and its selection of fine truck stops. She sang Pentecostal hymns in her family’s church and performed in local productions of Godspell and You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. It was little more than an average, provincial life.When the nearest big-city country station held a singing contest, a 14-year-old Lavigne sent in a tape for a chance to sing with none other than Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop superstar. Lavigne didn’t just acquit herself: She won the damn thing, which meant driving two-plus hours to the nation’s capital and belting Twain’s brassy 1993 hit “What Made You Say That” in front of a packed Ottawa hockey arena. At the time, Lavigne told Twain she wanted to be “a famous singer.”Lavigne had no idea how quickly her dream would come true: Within a few years, she’d be sneering on the cover of Rolling Stone in a black tank top and a curt plaid skirt, winkingly labeled “the Britney slayer.” The onetime country-pop princess who performed hits by Faith Hill and Sarah McLachlan at an early record label audition had become a gleeful anarchist, a pop-punk supernova who skated through videos for hits like “Complicated” and “Sk8er Boi,” causing chaos in ratty T-shirts and neckties. She wasn’t disingenuous or calculating; she was a teenager, one whose formative experiences and changes in taste were taking place while she navigated the expectations that come with a major-label record deal. The reaction between Lavigne’s volatile energy and the music industry’s commercial imperative produced her 2002 debut Let Go, a rebuttal of Spears-Aguilerian pop—overtly sexual, vaguely urban, hyper-processed—churned out by the exact same kind of hit factory. It boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.While Lavigne’s ascent from local radio contests to the top of the charts seems rapid in retrospect, her career took shape in fits and starts. Nine months after she appeared on stage with Twain, Cliff Fabri—the manager who shepherded her through the earliest phase of her career—watched her sing country karaoke in a Kingston, Ontario Chapters, the Canadian equivalent of being discovered in a college town’s Barnes & Noble. “I was thinking of her as another Sheryl Crow. They both had the same small-town roots,” Fabri told The New York Times in 2002. “Then I was thinking Fiona Apple, because of her independence. She definitely had attitude. So my line was Sheryl Crow meets Fiona Apple.”"

Oh, wait.","Ten years ago, who would've guessed that emo would usurp punk as the genre du jour for angst-ridden teens. By the late 1990s, most fans of the genre's second wave were abandoning it. Many of the best bands had split up, while the handful that were left were moving toward a more straightforward pop rock sound. But just as it appeared over, the scene suddenly exploded, giving birth to an entire new generation of slick, generic, mall-store neo-emo. It's like the bartender yelled last call, the house lights came on, and then at the last minute, he decided to keep the club open all night serving Cokes. So now, 20 years after Rites of Spring's only full-length album was released, we've arrived at Panic! at the Disco's A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.Where does one begin to describe this steaming pile of garbage? You've already seen the ridiculous name, so let's try a few of song titles on for size. Track two is called ""The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage"", and it's followed by ""London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines"". If those don't quite do it for you, check out ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", or my personal favorite, ""Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"".But of course, the asinine song titles and the moronic band name have nothing on the actual songs. The usual guitar, bass, and drums are augmented by drum machine beats and synths that would be more at home blaring over the P.A. at your local gym than in anything one might consider enjoyable music. The production, handled by Matt Squire, a guy who is certainly no stranger to radio-friendly emo, is slick and polished. Vocalist Brendon Urie's impassioned, warbling vocals are so strained it's as if he might just burst into tears at any moment. This poor guy's heart must get broken on a daily basis or something. And if it wasn't bad enough, someone convinced him to add some fancy effects on a track or two that make it sound like someone is lightly karate chopping him across the throat while he sings.The lyrics are just the sort of vague teen heartache you'd expect. In ""Camisado"", Urie croons, ""You're a regular decorated emergency/ The bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake,"" sliding up to a falsetto while keyboards shimmer behind him. In ""Time to Dance"", which utilizes some sort of poorly realized gun-as-a-camera metaphor, he belts out, ""When I say shotgun, you say wedding/ Shotgun/ Wedding"", and ""Give me envy/ Give me malice/ Give me attention/ Give me a break."" Yeah, you and me both, kid.It's sad that this is what emo has become. The genre's always had some irritating characteristics, but this newest batch of heartbroken heartthrobs has managed to build their careers solely out of those characteristics. The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there, but there's no sincerity, creativity, or originality."

Today, we revisit blink-182’s third album, a defining moment in both pop-punk and immaturity writ large.","On the weekend of the infamously disastrous Woodstock ’99, which symbolized rock radio’s id-fueled descent into aggro dipshittery, a snottier kind of teenage angst was manifesting 200 miles to the west in Buffalo, New York. Then in its fifth year, the Vans Warped Tour had crisscrossed the country bringing affordable revelry to the green-haired masses. If Woodstock was for the shirtless jocks, Warped Tour was for the skaters, losers, and wannabes who still sometimes needed a ride from mom. No one was there for the revolution; they were just teenagers drunk on community and tongue-kissing, blissfully alive during the final summer of what had been a relatively idyllic American decade. And that summer, no act on the bill was bigger than blink-182.While the concept of pop-punk dates back to ’70s bands like the Buzzcocks and the Undertones, pop-punk didn’t become actual popular music until 1994, when Green Day’s Dookie sold more than 12 million copies and set off a never-ending debate about selling out that persists in DIY spaces today. Sure, Green Day sang more about masturbation than anarchy, but that simply did not matter to all the young kids who, apart from lapping up the music, constituted a new customer base for the record industry to serve.These market conditions had lifted blink-182 to festival superstardom just five years into their recording career. In 1992, Mark Hoppus met Tom Delonge through Hoppus’ sister Anne, and they immediately connected through their obsession with punk rock and middle-school humor—two foundational elements for a new pop-punk band. But while they loved conceptual predecessors like the similarly Californian and cheeky Descendents, they were serious about owning a suburban home. “I’d like to make a lot of money and fuck credibility,” Hoppus said in 1998 to i-Zine. “People make so much out of something that’s just the band trying to get ahead and get its music to as many fans as possible.”They weren’t selling out; they were buying in. Part of that was Hoppus and Delonge’s exurban SoCal upbringing, which encouraged a sunny prankishness at odds with the urban despair of the big cities. “The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,” Delonge told music journalist John Robb in 2000. (He might have added “white,” too.) Two decades earlier, the teenaged Ramones were social outcasts in New York, but Delonge was named homecoming king his senior year of high school (he was also expelled for showing up drunk to a basketball game). What they began doing quite well and to excess was simple: record the pouty concerns of middle-class kids in a plainspoken language they could understand, set to addictive melodies and played at moshing speed."

Since 2009, recording mostly as FunkinEven, the London electronic musician has specialized in a jubilantly no-frills strain of house and techno. His rugged workouts for a stripped-down setup of synthesizer and drum machine are unvarnished, unfussy, and unsentimental. Often recorded in single takes, they have a gestural quality to them, like the arc of a hand slicing through air. And they tend to move in one direction: forward.A lot of the same qualities hold true for Fallen, his debut album, and his first major release under his own name. It’s not lo-fi, exactly, but it's proudly bare bones, giving no corner to excess. There’s no advanced digital signal processing here, no fantastical sound design, no psychoacoustic sleight-of-hand—just gnarled acid sequences, bare-knuckle drum programming, and drifting synths. In most cases, the technology behind these tunes hasn’t changed much, if at all, in the past 30-odd years; nor, for that matter, has their style.He covers a lot of ground: “Jedi” is smooth, pinging techno in the vein of Jeff Mills or Robert Hood. “XL,” which he made some 15 years ago, as he told The Wire, brandishing an old floppy disc on which he'd saved the song, teases rolling jazz piano over an excitable house rhythm, ragged filters in constant motion. “Kingdom” is a spacious, starry-eyed acid cut similar to Joey Anderson or Levon Vincent; its structure is simple, but the dimensions suggested by its spiraling arpeggios are vast and expansive. “Reficul” is a greasy, mean-mugging drum-machine fugue in the spirit of “Night,” a 2012 collaboration with Kyle Hall under their Funkinevil alias, and “Disciple” is a thrilling explosion of breakbeats and stuttering horn stabs that throws off energy as though exorcising demons.But Fallen also marks an important shift from Julien’s earlier work. While there are plenty of storming club cuts here, the whole thing is more varied, more nuanced, and more contemplative than any other record in his catalog. “Begins,” an ambient miniature that opens the record with mercurial timbres and complex harmonies, sets up a full-on jazz fusion number in the form of “Chantel,” flush with digital chimes, flute synth, and squirrely bass work reminiscent of Jaco Pastorius or Stanley Clarke. (It comes as no surprise to learn that Julien cites Plastic People’s Co-Op parties as a major influence; jazz fusion and electric soul played a huge part in the development of the broken-beat aesthetic.)"

You might argue that Weezer's Make Believe drew a 0.4 just for sharing a name with a Kinsella project, although sucking mightily probably had something to do with it. I've always found Joan of Arc's artified emo shockfests to be insufferable, but today, the Devil is ordering a personalized Make Believe Neighborhoodie to fend off a sudden cold snap: I'm dropping some Forkian love on Kinsella. Schreiber's gonna hate me (Ryan, did I ever tell you that I regard you as the Lewis Lapham of indie?).What's interesting is that Make Believe's debut EP isn't even a deviation from Kinsella's usual noodle-rock screamifying-- the band is essentially Joan of Arc playing non-JOA songs-- it's simply a streamlined, rawked out version of the same. If there's nothing here a Joan of Arc fan wouldn't recognize as Kinsella fare, there's also surprisingly little that would lead a gimlet-eyed hipster to make the international sign for ""gag me with a spoon."" Take opening track ""We're All Going to Die"". The lyrics are aiming high, and Kinsellas, ever the postmodernist, manages to sustain his truism and tautology laden screed on the denaturing of language for the duration.But screw the lyrics; the guitar sound is out of this world. ""We're All Going to Die"" is comprised of squelchy knots of squealing melody, and sounds like it was written forwards, played backwards and recorded forwards again. The off-kilter drums and intensely prickly guitars are connected by slick, simmering bridges; it all comes off as psychedelic, proggy, or mathy depending on your age and tastes, but I've got to point out that if there's such a thing as post-screamo, this is it. Same goes for ""Britt's Favorite"", which opens with warm, splintering arpeggios that gradually cohere into a fizzy 4/4 stomp. These are the highest highs, and a whole EP this focused might have earned Kinsella a previously unthinkable 7.0. The other three tracks are more piecemeal, and while the parts that work are potent, the ones that don't are a little too JOA for comfort. But overall, this is a solid fifteen-minute thrill ride from a dude I thought was only capable of Willy Wonka-style terror cruises."

The more prevalent kind is the fodder that fills a critic's mailbox, bands with awkward names and laser-printed cover art that don't inspire ire so much as pity. The second group is more treacherous: Bands that yield high expectations due to past achievements, yet, for one reason or another, wipe out like ""The Wide World of Sports""' agony-of-defeat skier.Often, these albums are bombarded with website tomatoes for reasons you can't necessarily hear through speakers: the band changes their sound and image to court a new crossover audience, perhaps, or attempts a mid-career shift into ill-advised territory. Or maybe they start writing songs about Moses in hip-hop slang. But sometimes the bad album in question is none of the above; it doesn't offend anyone's delicate scene-politics sensibilities or try to rewrite a once-successful formula in unfortunate ways. Sometimes an album is just awful. Make Believe is one of those albums.Weezer have been given a lot of breaks in their second era-- both The Green Album and Maladroit were cut miles of slack despite consisting of little more than slightly above-average power-pop. The obvious reason for this lenience has to do with the mean age of rock critics, and the fact that most of these mid-20s scribes were at their absolute peak for bias-forming melodrama when The Blue Album and Pinkerton were released. Even for someone like me, who came late to the Weezer appreciation club, it was impossible to hear these ""comeback"" albums without the echoes of the earlier alt-rock pillars ringing in our ears.But now there's an antidote to that nostalgic interference. Right from the start of Make Believe, when Weezer lurches into a flaccid take on Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock N' Roll"" with an unfathomably horrible speak/sing vocal from Rivers Cuomo (think ""I like girls who wear Abercrombie & Fitch""), you can hear hundreds of critics mouthing ""no no no"" and going into crumpled shock. What's more disconcerting is that the song gets worse over the course of its three minutes (let's just say ""Framptonesque voicebox solo"" and get back to repressing the memory)-- and it's the album's first single.Hearing a song like ""We Are All on Drugs"", which nicks the classic melody of the schoolyard ""Diarrhea"" song (you know, ""when you're sliding into first..."" and so on) for an anti-drug message stiffer than Nancy Reagan's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" cameo, it calls into question whether The Blue Album was really that great, or whether it just stood out as a rare beacon of guitar pop in a grunge-obsessed era. Trying to wrap your mind around the land-cliché-record lyrics of songs like ""My Best Friend"" and ""Haunt You Every Day"" leads me to wonder how Pinkerton could ever have seemed like such a cathartically resonant treatise on unrequited love. Was Rivers Cuomo always on the notebook-scrawl level of ""I don't feel the joy/ I don't feel the pain,"" and did we not notice because scrawling in notebooks was the depth of our emotional knowledge at the time?"

Then in its fifth year, the Vans Warped Tour had crisscrossed the country bringing affordable revelry to the green-haired masses. If Woodstock was for the shirtless jocks, Warped Tour was for the skaters, losers, and wannabes who still sometimes needed a ride from mom. No one was there for the revolution; they were just teenagers drunk on community and tongue-kissing, blissfully alive during the final summer of what had been a relatively idyllic American decade. And that summer, no act on the bill was bigger than blink-182.While the concept of pop-punk dates back to ’70s bands like the Buzzcocks and the Undertones, pop-punk didn’t become actual popular music until 1994, when Green Day’s Dookie sold more than 12 million copies and set off a never-ending debate about selling out that persists in DIY spaces today.

Part of that was Hoppus and Delonge’s exurban SoCal upbringing, which encouraged a sunny prankishness at odds with the urban despair of the big cities. “The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,” Delonge told music journalist John Robb in 2000. (He might have added “white,” too.) Two decades earlier, the teenaged Ramones were social outcasts in New York, but Delonge was named homecoming king his senior year of high school (he was also expelled for showing up drunk to a basketball game).

Compared to other artists', Damon Albarn's playroom chest must be filled to bursting: the cultural drawer cluttered with horror films, anime, and rock'n'roll stereotypes; the musical drawer crammed full of dub, hip-hop, dancehall, and afropop. In fact, Albarn seems to have so many creative distractions tempting his muse, he can't even keep them from occasionally invading the conservative environs of his day job-- each Blur album manages to squeeze in at least one ill-fitting endeavor like Think Tank's ""Crazy Beat"".Fortunately, Gorillaz provides Albarn an outlet to vent his taste for sci-fi kitsch, and satiate his urge to break free from rock with guitars-- and it's a surprisingly successful outlet, at that. (Did anyone really expect an edgy street-cred Banana Splits to be worth discussing four years into its discography?) Rather than falling flat, Gorillaz have strangely become a therapeutic and clever way for Albarn to subvert the usual egolympics associated with a solo project. Coyly hiding behind Jamie Hewlett's thick-inked pop caricatures and a phalanx of guest stars, Gorillaz allows Albarn to practice self-indulgence under heavy personality camouflage-- though never so heavy that there's any question as to who's really pulling the strings.Like the Gorillaz's self-titled debut, Demon Days goes the way of most auteur projects, its oversize idea load making for a trip equal parts peak and valley. But also like the debut, Demon Days is better than it has any right to be, featuring singles stronger than anything released under the Blur banner since, you know, that ""Woo-hoo"" song. For a project that could easily have been little more than Damon Albarn Remakes ""Ghost Town"" 15 Times (With More Rapping & Cartoons), this is a follow-up that proves Gorillaz, weirdly, has legs-- not that the four-year break hurt any.In order to keep things fresh, however, Albarn made a few exchanges at the hip-hop Wal-Mart, trading in his sputtering old Dan the Automator model for Danger ""as seen on CNN!"" Mouse, and swapping out Del tha Funkee Homosapien for MF Doom and... Dennis Hopper. These new collaborators add more to the proceedings than just increasing the comic-dork factor by about 10, particularly Danger Mouse, whose colorfully dense production helps buoy the occasionally slight genre sketches scripted by Albarn and his fleet of retro keyboards.For most of the album, Danger Mouse & Albarn make like they're Dario Argento & Goblin, to the point that this Fangoria neophyte can't tell the difference between the sampled zombie-flick scores and the facsimile ones (I'm pretty sure ""Last Living Souls"" is the former). Obviously, this agenda cues me to resort to adjectives like ""foreboding,"" ""ominous,"" and ""sinister,"" but Albarn can't help making his haunted house a discotheque. As with the standouts from the debut album, the best tracks here strike a unique balance between slacker detachment and dance-floor bounce: ""Feel Good Inc."" swerves through an anxious bassline to a choice De La Soul drive-by, while ""DARE"" defibrillates Shaun Ryder to shout along while Albarn channels Prince's synths and falsettos."

Even while singing of anger, betrayal, and disappointment on ever-bigger stages and in technicolor videos throughout the last 13 years, the Paramore leader has projected a pro’s poise along with a child star’s desire to please. Since she was a young teen, Williams has led angsty pop-punk singalongs with the friendly authority of a summer camp counselor. She has bounced around. She has smiled. She has been in complete control. But in the recent video for “Hard Times,” the first single from her band’s fifth album, things are a bit off.The clip begins with Williams climbing out of a car that’s crashed onto a stage set decorated with cotton-ball clouds, wearing an unsure look: How did I get here? Soon enough, a microphone is put in front of her, and she starts to sing and dance to a bright new-wave bop. But all is not quite right. When she flashes her teeth here, it looks more like a rictus of madness than a sign of genuine pleasure, a wary smile from the rock’n’roll ride Williams has gone through.Paramore have had enough tabloid-baiting personnel switches to warrant one of those color-coded timelines on the band’s Wikipedia page—because the truth is as long as they have existed, there have been whispers about Williams breaking away as a solo star. Though past members of the Nashville group have quit, whining about their second-fiddle status, you could argue that, by sticking to the idea of being in a rock band with her best friends—not exactly the most au courant concept in an era of ProTools pop—it’s Williams who has made the biggest sacrifice. So, after years of merrily keeping the Paramore lights on, the 28-year-old singer and lyricist considers her life and lets go of her grin on After Laughter.Which all seems like an immense bummer. But just as this album highlights Williams’ most existentially despondent musings to date, it is also the most fizzy record Paramore have ever recorded. This extreme yin-yang quality is somewhat new for them. When former guitarist Josh Farro was leading the musical charge for their first three albums, his ominous, distorted anthems propelled Williams’ angst as she screamed into the void like a heavy-metal hellion, albeit one informed by a pious Christian faith; on 2009’s Brand New Eyes, which chronicled Farro and Williams’ real-life breakup, the instrumentation and the vocals each fought to tell their side, making for a glorious explosion. After Farro’s departure, guitarist Taylor York took over the musical heavy lifting on 2013’s Paramore, on which the group searched  for a new identity, touching on post-rock bombast, string-laden balladry, and the funk-pop of their biggest hit yet, “Ain’t It Fun.” Since then, longtime bassist Jeremy Davis left amid a dispute over songwriting credits (he and the group recently settled a lawsuit) while former drummer Zac Farro, Josh’s brother, returns after six years. All these comings and goings might seem trivial in relation to Williams’ supernova star power, but the drama has always fueled her songwriting, as well as the band’s sound, to an outsized degree."

While never very lyrically insightful or poetic, American Idiot is certainly the band's most ambitious record to date, with a consistent narrative spun throughout its 13 tracks-- two of which boast runtimes in excess of nine minutes. Life-changing? Not a bit, but there's something to be said for having the balls.","Green Day were always innately suburban. THC and apathy themed their 1994 single ""Longview""; their breakthrough album, Dookie, was a precocious jumble of power chords and smart aleck prurience, a blend of The Descendents and flinty Buzzcockian spark. They didn't have any answers-- they just wanted weed and entitlement. That cul de sac selfishness and bratty pose carried through to the sugar-pap mallpunks Green Day spawned on the backslide of the 90s; unfortunately, the trio's undeniable early flair for songcraft did not.In 1999, pop-punk exploded with the arrival of Blink-182's Enema of the State, and the brand gleefully deteriorated from there, bottoming out in the young and hopeless days of a dollar-store post-millennium, where the suburban trash culture that Billie Joe Armstrong once dismissively skewered has blended dangerously with a shifty political climate, causing volatile upheavals in blue collar comedy and bicameral nimrods. Now Green Day are back to pull the pin on the grenade.2000's Warning only scored the band two modern rock hits, and in contrast to the million-selling marks of previous records, was something of a commercial flop. By this point, their hit-making, image-cultivating offspring had bid them good riddance, and those disillusioned by Green Day's populist stature were no longer listening. If they had been, they'd have heard some of the grit and dynamics that gave birth to a much wider sonic palette on American Idiot, the band's first album since, and unquestionably their most ambitious to date.As a songwriter, Armstrong's penchant for economy is still present-- he'll never be a wordsmith or a magic melody maker. But Idiot's slicing power chordage reaches to Green Day's old English and Cali punk influences with tingling fingers, adds acoustic instruments without sounding forced or contrived, and lyrically grapples with the cultural predicaments and awkward shittiness of ""subliminal mind-fuck America,"" circa 2004: ""Now everybody do the propaganda/ And sing along in the age of paranoia."" Armstrong delivers the title track couplet like a command at the revolution day sock-hop, and its instrumental viciousness is enough to shatter punchbowl glass.Like Bad Religion, whose recent The Empire Strikes First was not only a reaction to U.S. politics and culture post-9/11, but a powerful return to cynical form, Green Day's dissent and frustration has inspired a new strength of craft in them as well. Armstrong's frustration comes out in seething anger: The ragged, rousing ""Letterbomb"" is both a melodic powder keg and a blaring bullhorn promoting the destruction of complacency, while the album's title track is energizing and provoking in the way effective punk revivalism should be."

Today, we revisit Seal’s 1991 debut, a luxurious album that grew out of the UK rave scene and took his inimitable voice to the world.","In London’s Trafalgar Square, thousands of young people gathered to fight for their right to rave. Brightly colored tracksuits and baggy denim rippled in waves, as far as the eye could see. Demonstrators at this 1990 Freedom to Party Rally were protesting legislation aimed at kneecapping the acid-house bacchanals that had recently revolutionized UK youth culture. The stakes were high: “IF YOU DONT STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS THERE WON’T BE ANY MORE ‘SUMMER OF LOVE’, THERE WONT EVEN BE ANY MORE RAVES,” warned an all-caps flyer for the event, apostrophes breathlessly optional.Despite the cold January rain, the mood was jovial. There were boomboxes, a bullhorn, a beach ball. Pirate station Obsession FM broadcasted live from the event. People danced in empty fountains and clambered atop the bronze lions sternly guarding Nelson’s Column. Later that night, revelers would break into a warehouse in the village of Radlett, near the M25 orbital—the motorway that had funneled so many convoys full of party people into the English countryside over the previous year—and there, despite skirmishes with police, the party would run until 9 the following morning.Weaving through the London crowd were two young men who had nipped down to soak up the vibe. One of them was Adam Tinley, 22, better known as Adamski. Already deep in the rave scene, he had scored a minor hit with the previous year’s squelchy “N-R-G” and even appeared on the BBC’s Top of the Pops—the first instrumental act to play the show in a decade, by his reckoning. The other was Sealhenry Samuel, known simply as Seal, nearly five years Tinley’s senior but a relative newcomer to the swiftly evolving rave movement. The two had come to the protest to feed off its energy before heading back to Adamski’s studio, a 20-minute walk away, where they were laying down Seal’s vocals over Adamski’s beats. There, hunched over a Roland 909 drum machine, feeding floppy disks into an Ensoniq SQ-80 synthesizer, they channeled the energy of the moment into a song about freedom.They made for a curious duo. Adamski, bearing a “fragile, little-boy-lost demeanor,” was a studio tinkerer and technophile who had played in Diskord Datkord, a Dadaist electro-pop group known for chaotic multimedia spectacles—a dog was sometimes involved—that often ended in nudity. Seal, on the other hand, was imposingly tall, with jagged scars on his cheeks and bits of tinsel woven into his dreadlocks, partial to musicians like Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, and, his favorite, Joni Mitchell. Seal had recently returned from a year-long stint in Asia; while the UK’s day-one ravers were necking their first pills in muddy fields, he’d been playing in funk and blues bands in Japan and Thailand. Upon his return to the UK, a friend, determined to show Seal what he’d been missing, had taken him to the Santa Pod Raceway for Sunrise 5000, an 8,000-strong rave where Adamski was holding court in an airplane hangar. The sound and the spectacle hit Seal with the force of an epiphany. (“I don’t think I really knew myself before then,” he would later admit.)"

On their three albums to date, the U.K. disco-punk trio have proven themselves more than qualified for the job: Their music is all sweat and swagger, a breathless regimen of pulse-pounding rhythm and hectoring directives that both berate you into thinking you’re not doing enough while inspiring you to do better. And after subtly upgrading their scrappy sound on 2018’s The Official Body—and graduating from the DIY circuit to international festival stages—Shopping are more vigorously shaking up their program. But while the group’s fourth album, All of Nothing, bears all the surface sparkle and smooth contours of a brand new elliptical apparatus, the workout is every bit as demanding as before.Shopping have reached the same crossroads many of their post-punk forbears hit around the mid-’80s—i.e., the choice between wrapping their polemical discourse in more pop-friendly packaging to win over the masses, or resigning themselves to a life on the fringes spent preaching to the choir. All or Nothing attempts to have it both ways, amplifying and revelling in the perennial tension between escapist pleasure and anti-capitalist critique at the core of so much classic post-punk. The new record leans more heavily on synthesizers and drum pads than any previous Shopping album, but stops just shy of redefining them as a synth-pop band. After all, this group has always functioned as a pure musical democracy, its constituent parts—Andrew Milk’s piston-like drumming, Billy Easter’s deep, juddering bass, Rachel Aggs’ wonderfully squiggly guitar—locking together like a jigsaw puzzle, with no single component overwhelming the others. But the added textures invest the group’s invectives with heightened drama. When Aggs demands, “Why don’t you show some initiative?” on the prickly “Initiative,” she seems to implicate herself—so the group puts her words into action and redirects the song skyward on a synth-powered motorik thrust.A big reason why Shopping adapt so easily to their new surroundings is that they’ve never been an angry, confrontational sort of post-punk band. For all their wiry energy and staccato sloganeering, Shopping have always embraced pop melody and absurdist humor, and All or Nothing’s more polished production pushes those qualities to the fore: On “Follow Me,” Aggs combats surveillance culture by cheekily seducing a CCTV camera (“Follow me/I’ll make it worth it!”), while the consumerist blues of “For Your Pleasure” imagines an alternate ’80s where the B-52’s steered clear of the Love Shack. But even in the absence of electronic embellishments, Shopping remain a marvel of human technology: Layering no fewer than three different competing chorus lines atop its hand-clapped punk-funk beat, “Expert Advice” is both an emblem of information-overload culture and a model of spartan efficiency. And on the equally lean and propulsive “Body Clock,” the band approach peak intensity while addressing the sheer exhaustion of staying alive in 2020: “I need something to calm my nerves,” Aggs sings, “I’ve just got to keep up the pace.” It’s the sort of admission that suggests the onset of a panic attack, or a full-on nervous breakdown. But as the song’s incessant rhythm affirms, relief is just a dancefloor away.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Today, we revisit a folk classic that came to the world stage with a perspective crystallized in society’s margins.","A spotlight comes up on Tracy Chapman as she moves into the a capella song “Behind the Wall.” She sings from the point of view of a neighbor hearing a woman screaming in the apartment next door. Her trembling contralto soars and then, just as quickly, falls into a whisper. Between verses, she lets the air settle into silence before charging into the dark scene once again. The last lines—“The police/Always come late/If they come at all”—ring off into nothing. Chapman wrote the song in 1983, while she was still a student at Tufts University and busking in Boston for distracted passersby. Within five years, she would perform it for a television audience of 600 million in a packed Wembley Stadium for Nelson Mandela’s 70th birthday benefit concert.Alone on that massive stage, guitar in hand, she allowed the echoing mic and screaming crowd to amplify the quiet of the song. And as she sang with that magnetic calm, she built an atmosphere as intimate as each listener’s childhood bedroom. “Behind the Wall” was the second of what was supposed to be a three-song set. But then, as the legend goes, serendipity gave the world another glimpse of this commanding artist. Just before Stevie Wonder was supposed to perform, a piece of his sound equipment went missing, and he refused to go on stage. Chapman agreed to take his place. It was in that surprise second set that she played “Fast Car.”On her self-titled debut, which had been released on Elektra two months earlier with only modest sales expectations, “Fast Car” is a counterbalance to the weightiness of “Behind the Wall.” The low verses mix bleak recognition with quiet hope before building to a chorus so wistful, so joyfully tender it can transport you to a time in your life when you were younger and maybe a little less scared. Most of the people watching her performance at Wembley did not arrive knowing Chapman’s power, and most likely had never heard of her before. But they experienced in real time her ability to lift hearts into people’s throats. She performed her songs the same way she had on the streets for years: alone and brilliantly exposed.We’ve witnessed the worst this world can throw our way, Chapman suggests on her debut, at times through her working-class characters. But the album creates a world where no force exists without a counter. The worst of what we’ve endured, she also offers, makes righteous justice inevitable. It’s a worldview that many could tune into. By the end of the summer of 1988, a few months after the Nelson Mandela tribute, Tracy Chapman was a platinum album and the singer was a star."

Today, we explore Eminem’s monumental album The Marshall Mathers LP.","Eminem prowled down a long line of young men, each sporting close-cropped, bleached blonde hair, each dressed just like him. Floodlights lit up the empty avenue outside of Radio City Music Hall where the rapper marched into the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards with his army to perform “The Real Slim Shady,” the first single from The Marshall Mathers LP. Underneath the song’s wide umbrella of references, a fleet-footed MC took up residence in Dr. Dre’s gooey bass and ornamented harpsichord—J.S. Bach bouncing in a lowrider. Proto-memes and trending topics got thrown into a blender; they came out laced in elegant knots. This was the primordial oil slick from which Eminem emerged, the god particle that launched him to new levels of superstardom.”The Real Slim Shady” wasn’t rap about what was happening on the streets of Brooklyn or Compton or Atlanta or even Detroit. It was rap about what was on television. Specifically, what was on television at that very moment. It was an echo-chamber of MTV-watchers, a real-time “Beavis and Butt-Head” for those who would be later be crowned millennials. As reality TV gained traction, Eminem’s dressing-down of celebrities endeared him to a generation who would soon find “drama” to be the coin of the entertainment realm. He knew it before many: People like the stuff they recognize. That’s pop music.This was 18 years ago, two or three epochs in music-industry time, back when “Total Request Live” held sway while boy bands and newly crowned pop stars like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera filled the airwaves. Long before I ever started thinking critically about music, I sat watching Eminem’s VMA performance from my rural Wisconsin couch, a 10th grader with no social media, no cell phone. I was Eminem’s audience, a teen from Middle America, one of millions. As he stormed the theater with about a hundred carbon copies of himself, countless sociopolitical minefields were being set up around me. I had no awareness of any of them. What I thought, instead, was: This guy is really fucking good at rapping.After the release of The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem would shatter sales records with 1.7 million copies sold in the first week alone, 6.5 million in the first month, and eventually, over 35 million sold worldwide. It’s still the best-selling rap record of all time. He would cross over from rap to pop and rock radio, sell out arenas, win Grammys, rankle Lynne Cheney in front of the U.S. Congress, add a word to the dictionary, and incite protests from no small number of social justice groups. By virtue of his whiteness and talent in almost equal measure, Eminem would come to rule pop culture in America by becoming this century’s prototypical troll."

Without producer Robin Hannibal, who fleshed out the group’s 2013 debut with minimalist, sumptuous production, Milosh leaned on beefier instrumentation and overstated lyrics that sapped most of the enigmatic, economical appeal from their music. Rhye’s new EP Spirit, recorded after an extensive tour last summer, feels like a loose, low-stakes companion to Blood. Rhye’s usual electronic and guitar stylings are stripped back to meditative piano arrangements and ambient mood-setting, making for an effective if lightweight backdrop for his sighing variety of romance.Milosh put Spirit together after being gifted a baby grand piano by his girlfriend, using daily exercises as a form of meditation following a draining tour schedule. The brief eight-song album reflects that sense of introspection and ritualistic quiet, with most songs resting in minor key and Milosh’s hazy timbre offering up long, wordless hums. Rhye has used chamber music as an indirect influence in the past, whether stacking harmonies over a horn section on “Woman” or adding plucked strings to their cover of Procol Harum’s “A Whiter Shade of Pale.” But here Milosh mostly dresses things down to an intentionally spare, percussive base; his piano is close-mic’d alongside the slightest brushes of synths and strings, signaling intimacy without the heavy-handedness that dragged down Blood.Lyrically, Milosh remains exclusively concerned with a tortured type of desire: He wants to be needed, feel your pain, wage your wars, et cetera. Delivered in a smooth, unified whisper, the words of affection sometimes sound vaguely sinister rather than sexy, as on “Needed,” written and produced with former Semisonic singer Dan Wilson: “Why you look so fragile? Do I seem so bad?/Oh, you look so pretty, there’s no devils here.” The song hinges on even clumsier phrasing during its chorus (“I wanna be needed, that’s what I need”) that undercuts all the feverish desire lurking at its core. Elsewhere, Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds adds his minimalist touch to the simmering, hymn-like standout “Patience,” while Milosh lets his piano do the legwork on muted instrumental trifles “Malibu Nights” and “Green Eyes.” It all feels a little perfunctory for Rhye at this point, but in a characteristically refined way that at least makes for easy casual listening.Spirit boils down the seductive essence of Rhye’s music to core elements. It would do well as an introduction to the group for an unfamiliar listener, but doesn’t feel necessary by any means. If anything, Spirit comes across as more mood music by design, bespoke and undemanding, and it probably already has real estate on every bedroom-themed playlist on Spotify. Rhye is now a reliably polished provider of this style of music, but it’s a position that clearly doesn’t allow for very many risks."

Over solemn piano chords and a lockstep electro groove that hints at the cadence of a protest march, Gahan laments how “we feel nothing inside” as we “track it all with satellites” and “watch men die in real time.” By track two, “Where’s the Revolution,” Gahan begins calling for out-and-out revolt, chiding the audience: “Come on people/You’re letting me down.” In his golden-throated baritone, Gahan reminds us that we’ve been “pissed on/For too long,” our “rights abused” by governments who “Manipulate and threaten/With terror as a weapon.”Apparently, principal lyricist and songwriter Martin Gore is no longer content to focus all his attention on the spiritual searching that has defined Depeche Mode’s music for more than 30 years. Over that time, few artists have so artfully portrayed the inner dialogue between redemption and indulgence. By the band’s 1990 breakout Violator, Gore had basically invented his own syntax for the human condition as a purgatorial struggle between sinful pleasures and a yearning for higher peace. And Gahan, with his ability to invest urgency, soul, and a feeling of debauched weariness into subjects like S&M and tortured love, has never failed to translate Gore’s restless malaise to the throngs who fill stadiums to connect with it. Gahan turns despair into sex appeal unlike no other. But this time, he’s tasked with looking up from his satin, regret-stained sheets and making us believe that an aging rock star really cares about civil unrest.Gahan delivers Gore’s state-of-world address for three songs in a row before going back to the band’s bread-and-butter obsessions. Later, though, on “Poorman”—which self-consciously references the spartan electronic gurgle of the Violator hit “Policy of Truth”—Gore and Gahan risk coming off as oblivious to the irony when they observe that “corporations get the breaks/Keeping almost everything they make” and ask, “When will it trickle down?” But Depeche Mode deliver anthems with such proficiency that sincerity barely matters. A song like “Where’s the Revolution” makes you feel like singing in response to today’s headlines. Depeche Mode still make universal, stadium-sized music that’s limber enough to fit through your bedroom doorframe, as if it had been conceived with your life in mind.In some respects, though, their consistency works against them. The sixth album since the departure of multi-instrumentalist/arranger Alan Wilder, Spirit sees Depeche Mode once again shuffling through the most quintessential components of their sound. On “Cover Me,” Gore’s haunting Lanois-esque guitar twang allows you to close your eyes and picture yourself under the Northern lights Gahan sings about. But aside from “Cover Me,” Spirit lacks the ambience of Depeche Mode’s most atmospheric material. If only producer/mixer James Ford (Florence and the Machine, Foals, Arctic Monkeys) had disheveled the sounds a bit, Spirit could have better asserted its place in Depeche Mode’s body of work.Instead, Ford—who is also one half of the electronic duo Simian Mobile Disco—mimics the vibe of the band’s iconic work with producer Flood. But even Flood didn’t imitate himself when he mixed the last DM album, 2013’s far more creatively resolute Delta Machine. Nevertheless, this is a band whose effortlessness can misguide you into thinking they’re not trying. Don’t be fooled. In the bridge of “Where’s the Revolution,” Gahan repeats the line “the train is coming, the train is coming... get on board.” You can draw inspiration from that lyric whether or not you take to the streets or petition your elected officials. Gore’s directive is less about activism and more about opening your heart so that it guides your conscience. For him, the term “spirit” has come to encompass politics, but it’s fueled by the same eros that’s driven the band’s music since day one. Which is why Spirit is so convincing in spite of its radical shift in tenor. For both the band and audience, that shift couldn’t have come at a better time."

Even calling them post-rock isn't a perfect fit; after all, the album does have vocals, as sparingly used as they may be. Now reissued by ATP Recordings two years after its original release on Acuarela Discos, Spirit is a moody and mostly instrumental affair, but it's strikingly different than any similar act running today; this is something much more haunted and sparse. Many songs are dominated more by the echo of a piano key or the warm hum after a guitar string settles than the notes themselves.Deliberate one-note bass and steady horse-clop drumming leads a floating sing-song vocal on ""From the North"", sounding not just ""cinematic"" and sweeping, but dreamlike. The vocals here are breathy, high, and nearly ghostlike, used as just another texture among many. The eventual crescendo isn't uncommon among Apse's peers, and while they do raise the volume and the distortion here, the buildup might be the more captivating part. Even when thrashing away, they seem to know the value of open space, and they know when enough is enough, cutting their well-earned climax surprisingly short.""Legions"" is bult on a music-box melody, muffled and faint just below the exchange between the rhythm section and a once-strummed chord. The rhythm suddenly becomes much more discernible and urgent, and a voice kicks in, singing a mantra for more material issues (""We love our lovers, but we want to be loved by another."") From there, they veer back and forth between rollicking and atmospheric, using their quickly mutating composition to stretch out the tension.""Shade of the Moor"" and especially ""The Crowned"" have lyrics that demand more attention without stealing the focus, and ""Crowned"" is where the tribal rhythms of the album really start to take shape. This continues later with ""Ark"", with pounding, primal drums that eventually recede into ominous radio static. ""Wind Through the Walls"" brings the record into haunted-house territory, courtesy of piano and layered vocals through chamber-of-souls-level echo, and even the quiet, tiptoeing rhythm of ""Blackwood Gates"" sounds vaguely threatening, as does the forebodingly slow closer of the title track.But whether it's a séance or a sacrifice they're conjuring, the tone and feel of the record stays uniform, for better or for worse. What could be a consistent sound and mood for some may be an endless revision of one song for others. Either way, it's the band's grasp of tension and space that makes Spirit a distinctive and not-so-easily-bracketed album. Its big crescendos feel paranoid and desperate, its slower moments vibrate with danger, and its creeps are subtle but visceral."

Swinscoe's downtempo outfit-- which escaped the trappings of its peers by feeling more like expansive, carefully constructed suites than collections of songs-- returns after a five-year drought.","History has been kind to J. Swinscoe. Despite a five-year drought, his downtempo jazz outfit Cinematic Orchestra has maintained a level of after-the-fact credibility that perceived contemporaries like Nightmares on Wax, Lamb, and Skalpel would probably kill for in 2007. It's true that with the benefit of hindsight, a lot of the stuff from that early noughties post trip-hop milieu doesn't sound nearly as moony or as luxuriant as it once did. For better or worse, that general blueprint (loping rhythms, swooshy atmospherics, stirring strings, trembling female vocals) never managed to transcend the stereotype of being nothing more than a sonic duvet for the gentrifying frontlines; no wonder that as scenes went, it evaporated faster than you could spell ""Café Del Mar"".But thanks mostly to 2002's superb Every Day, Cinematic Orchestra escaped that era pretty much intact. Where most of their contemporaries scored easy points by merging Hallmark-style sentimentality with wiffly atmospherics, Cinematic always seemed to aim higher, recruiting gnarled instrumental veterans, drawing deep from jazz, and making records that felt more like expansive, carefully constructed suites than collections of songs.All of which is reason enough to be a little bit offput by Swinscoe's new direction. His first full-length since Every Day, Ma Fleur abandons the light touch of his prior efforts in favor of an almost aggressively pretty approach. Where Swinscoe's early records were coy slow-burners that captivated over time, Ma Fleur leaves no room for subtlety. From the lonely, pregnant piano chords that open the record to the spiraling strings that close it, this is instructively momentous music, a conveyor belt of carefully delineated deep sighs, thoughtful sounds and big moments.If it all sounds a little too rich, well, it can be. The good news is that some of the songs do merit their lavish surroundings. With a monochromatic piano line and guest vocals from an androgynous-sounding Patrick Watson, opener ""To Build a Home"" is a candlelit ballad that bears more than a passing resemblance to Antony's work. Despite its beauty (or maybe because of it), it also establishes a stultifying air that the album never really shakes itself free of. Sometimes, as with the gently fingerpicked ""Music Box"", the shimmering and stately ""As the Stars Fall Into You"" and the quietly explosive ""Breathe"", it's a look that serves Swinscoe well. But by the time he breaks the pindrop silence with a creeping string coda for what feels like the ninetieth instance in 35 minutes, you might find yourself wishing this particular ride had more than two gears, or at least that one of those two gears wasn't 'park'.Sadly, there's nothing here that approaches Every Day's most spine-tingling moment-- the Roots Manuva-aided ""All Things to All Men"". If Ma Fleur is any indication, Swinscoe isn't particularly interested in evincing those kinds of thrills anymore, and that's a shame, because records that try to do what he's doing here are a hell of a lot easier to come by. Slow, sugary, and perhaps a little too safe, this is not quite the return that Cinematic fans will want it to be."

The second LP from UK-based singer and producer Daniel Woolhouse, Songs isn't quite the folksy confessional its title implies. This isn't Songs of Daniel Woolhouse; you won't find a ""So Long, Marianne"" in its ranks. Instead, Songs—maybe titled so simply as recompense for last year's punny *Life After Defo—*winds in tender and occasionally cathartic circles, focusing on the fears that accompany an intimacy that's supposed to be permanent.I mean, how do pessimists pair off? How do you put down your melancholy long enough to say, ""Hey, we'll probably like each other forever""? And once loneliness is legally written out of your record, where do you put the sadness that mysteriously hasn't vanished now that you sleep next to the same person every night? Woolhouse's Songs circles through these problems of commitment as he tries to situate himself as one half of a stable whole.""Every new day you can set on fire everything that you own,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". He can build a house, he knows, but not one that won't burn. This is a guy who's clearly in love and still can't help being a downer. ""I fell down/ Things all look bad to me,"" he sings on ""We Symbolise"". ""Love stings, everything goes,"" he muses on ""The Lovers"". What's more, he's got to weigh in his headspace with another person every day of his life. If there's danger, it's shared, for good or bad: ""I saw the weight in your eye in the corner of the night."" In marriage you get to be loved, but you also have to be constantly seen.Behind his accented murmurs, Woolhouse fills out Songs with bolder strokes than the pale production of Life After Defo. His synthesized instruments all sound synthesized— strings, drums, flutes, and horns plop directly out of a keyboard, and he does nothing to obscure it or make any stab at realism. Acoustic instruments would have projected a sense of collaboration, of others sharing a room and playing with him. Surrounded by fakes, Woolhouse sounds completely alone.It's there in his solitude that he can get at the roots of his worries. Woolhouse knows that for some of us, getting what you've always wanted prompts the question of whether or not you're even worthy of it in the first place. Throughout Songs, he yearns to be better—to be the sort of guy who deserves the love he wants. ""Make me good,"" he pleads on the beautifully revolving ""Near to a River"". ""Make me kind. Lift my body up. Make me kind."" He repeats the words like a mantra as the song overflows, carrying him away on its surf.Even within the safety of companionship, the outside world threatens danger. ""Find each other, cause it's all we've got,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". When he gets far enough outside of his own head, his expressions of love are charmingly simple: ""You're a human, and I like you the best."" That's it. That's all there is. He cuts out the sparkle from romance, knowing that it alone won't save him. But that doesn't mean he can't take root in it, can't wear it like armor. ""We've got peace in us,"" he concludes on ""Two Hearts"", the first in the album's delicate two-song finish. ""Love, love is enough."" Then, on ""A Shelter, a Weapon"": ""If you want me, you can have me 'til the end of time."" There's no guarantee anything lasts that long, but he's willing to fight for something like forever."

After a few years of letting that low end ride on UK dubstep labels like Dub Police and Sub Soldiers, Leeds-hailing first-wave wobbler Rusko released his debut LP, the intermittently interesting crossover attempt O.M.G.!, in May of 2010. Another, more culturally resonant bass-heavy release emerged that year: Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, the breakout second EP from the ever-polarizing skronkmeister and recent triple-Grammy winner Skrillex. By the end of the year, Rusko was not only castigating the absurdly named ""brostep"" sub-genre affixed to artists like him and Skrillex-- he was taking responsibility for the whole thing. ""Brostep is my fault, but now I've started to hate it, in a way,"" he told BBC 1Xtra DJ MistaJam. ""I kind of took it there, and now everybody else is taking it too far."" A year later and he was still on one, telling SPIN that the follow-up to O.M.G.! would be ""a reaction to the masculine, dance-floor orientated, distorted mess that is the current state of dubstep.""Really, it's strange Rusko was stuck with the ""brostep"" tag to begin with: The closest association he has with Alpha Wub Delta types is the liberal sampling of dialogue from Guy Ritchie's rough-and-tumble frat-arthouse touchstone Snatch found on his and dubstep mainstay Caspa's 2007 Fabriclive mix. He is more than familiar with letting that bass run wild, albeit in less aggressive ways than his HARD Fest contemporaries-- but you either have to be narrow-minded or just plain ignorant of dance culture as a whole to think that rocking a system with cavernous rumble is a new thing.All of which is to say Rusko's sour-grapes exhortations were probably a tad reactionary, the type of thing you might expect from a guy who recently threatened to leak his own record after his label, Mad Decent, arranged for a now-industry-standard online stream of it a few weeks before its release. Either way, we win, since on this sophomore LP, he's made some seriously twisted hooch from that puckered vine: A five-mile sprint away from easy categorization, Songs is a nasty carnival of electronic pop that giddily hops between styles-- jungle, rave, dub, purple, reggae, pure Guetta-fied pop, and so on-- like a broken radio. The nondescript album title refers to Rusko's nearly exclusive focus on vocal-heavy cuts, following O.M.G.!'s track-y vibe. There's a lot of toasting and wailing alike on this record, even if the former edges out the latter in terms of consistency."

During its best moments it brings to mind some of the work of Harold Budd, where melody and mood become two sides of the same coin.","For many music obsessives, a first close listen to Erik Satie’s Trois Gymnopédies changes everything. The French composer’s three 19th-century piano works serve as an introduction to one kind of minimalism—maximum emotion created with the fewest ingredients—and they show what can happen when you have the right note in the right place at the right time. The formal elegance of the pieces, along with the underlying sense of yearning and clear surface beauty, have made them a natural fit for advertising and film, and the Gymnopédies long ago became ubiquitous, their structure a sort of auditory cliché. But even with the overexposure, the power of Satie’s pieces are still there inside of us, guiding how we respond to simple piano music that leaves a lot of space. Whenever contemporary composers—from Chilly Gonzales to Eluvium to Jandek to Grouper to Aphex Twin—use a piano in this way, they tap into these buried associations.German composer and producer Nils Frahm’s most recent full-length, his fine 2013 album Spaces, featured plenty of piano but found him putting the instrument into a number of different contexts and adding electronics (the set also included live tracks). But among the earliest works of his career were two albums of solo piano work, and he returns here with a third, an album he gave away free on Twitter two weeks ago. Solo is almost exactly what you might expect from a record like this one; it’s spare, it’s lyrical, it’s generally quiet, and it’s very pretty. Your mileage will vary based on whether that is enough.Sometimes solo piano albums can get too sentimental, and can begin to sound like bad TV cues; sometimes they can be a little dry and academic, and can come over like an instrumental exercise. This one mostly fits into ""just right"" territory, balancing general loveliness with space and suggestion. Frahm's piano is creaky and there's a percussive tone coursing through some of these tracks, an extra ""pling"" that marks time with every keystroke. That extra texture gives a piece like ""Merry"" a tiny bit of grit to offset a gorgeous melody that might otherwise be overbearing, and gives the more downcast ""Some"" an extra ounce of dark weight. During its best moments Solo brings to mind some of the lower-stakes work of Harold Budd, where melody and mood become two sides of the same coin.The album’s second half finds Frahm playing more with form, but oddly the variety, rather than being welcome, actually breaks the spell of the album’s first half. ""Wall"" is a loud, pulsing piece that is interesting enough on its own but derails the album’s gentle mood, while ""Immerse!"" leans toward meandering abstraction, foregoing melody and in no way justifying its almost 11-minute length. Still, for a free album that sounds very nice in a room, Solo mostly delivers, tapping into that very specific identification with the solo piano as an expression of wistful sadness."

His 15-year recording career has found him equally at home as a leader and collaborator. He's a member of Fieldwork, has worked with hip-hop producer Mike Ladd and innovative saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, he's been involved with members of the M-Base improvisation collective and written orchestral works-- he's even on the new Das Racist mixtape (he co-produced the hidden track, ""Free Jazzmataz""). Last year, he made some waves outside of jazz with his trio's thunderous cover of M.I.A.'s ""Galang"", and this year he received the Jazz Journalists Association Jazz Award as Musician of the Year, which is a pretty big deal (he's keeping company with Ornette Coleman and Herbie Hancock there).But for all that, he's never done a record all on his own until now. A lot of jazz pianists eventually get around to a solo LP-- the instrument provides an ample platform-- and when they do, it becomes a matter of figuring out how to structure it. You can give it a conceptual underpinning, focus on one element of your style, or essentially do a studio recital that aims to show some range, and Iyer takes the last route, cushioning a suite of originals with a couple of clutches of interpretations. Among the covers, the two best both tackle classics by Duke Ellington. Iyer's version of the 1927 Ellington/Bubber Miley composition ""Black & Tan Fantasy"" embraces the weird, dark drag of the original, ending quotation of Chopin's funeral march and all. The original ""Fleurette Africaine"", from Duke's 1962 collaboration with Charles Mingus and Max Roach Money Jungle, was a beautiful, diffuse meditation-- Iyer's take is stormy and slow, cloaked in the same shade of midnight blue as the Anish Kapoor sculpture that adorns the album cover.His version of Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke's 1942 compositional breakthrough ""Epistrophy"" is off the wall, dancing around the melod [#script:http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js]|||||| y and speeding up Monk's left-hand patterns to a dizzying blur in tune with the sheet-of-sound technique Iyer has perfected over the years. He uses it more as a launch pad for a series of exploratory runs and tone clouds where he occasionally hints at Monk's rhythmic eccentricities. His cover of Michael Jackson's Thriller ballad ""Human Nature"" seems like it took a lot of planning to devise-- a few clever reharmonizations of the original's descending chorus hook keep it from getting too twinkly, but it's hard to pull off an instrumental version of a song like that without sounding precious in places, and it does at times."

After hopping from label to label, and dabbling in filmmaking, she has come to Editions Mego, the reconfigured version of the Viennese label that released her gorgeous 2001 album Shojo Toshi, to put out the aptly titled Solo. Mellower than her past two Mego releases, her new record finds Noriko going it alone, contorting the level planes of pop with her mobile, avant-garde imagination.Sounding like a patchwork of radio static, outdoor sounds, snippets of recorded strums, and the naked human voice, her music might be captured transmissions from the id, an amalgam of airwave junk reconstituted as art. Earthly nature sneaks in: The synthesizers approximate birds chirping and insects skittering (""Sun!""), burps and bowel movements (""Gift""). Add the warm rushes of melody, and you have Noriko's brand of Rabelaisian science fiction for the ears: a warble that softly grades into a dirty, otherworldly terrain.Not that the city lights of her native Japan and adopted France, past and present, don't spill through the haze. There's a sultry, moonlit glimmer to ""Spot"" that would fit nicely inside French chanson, but that's it for one-to-one parallels. When asked by Japanese magazine Shift how Paris has shaped her music, Noriko free-associated a better answer: ""Desolation, lassitude, reactionary."" Copyrighted, potentially, as Mitt Romney's campaign slogan, the three enigmatic nouns capture the breeze of post-riot, Chirac-era pessimism blowing through her album's happy textures.If France imparts mood, Japan lends order. Unlike Björk, whose glacier-shattering contralto tends to tyrannize her tracks, Noriko's humbler voice melts discreetly into a democracy of sound. Both women use their voices as instruments, but Noriko views her own merely as one among many: first among equals. So, you might say, she shares more with her fellow Japanese artists, the generation that includes Sachiko M, the onkyo queen of texture, ambient idol Miharu Sochi, and After Dinner's Haco, the rock star turned sound bricoleur.There is a healthy amount of disorder, too: As Noriko's fans would expect, Solo avoids the schematic here-to-there, beeline routes of Japanese pop. ""Spot"" may come the closest. Flickering inside these songs are the surreal motions of mental wanderlust, a weighty randomness that suggests the dislocations and spasms of reverie. Like the paper crane, like a dream, the wonders of Solo are rooted in metamorphosis.By turns tender and abstract, tracks like ""Ending Kiss"" (where she teams up with Hideki Ataka) and ""In a Chinese Restaurant"" seem to endlessly outpace expectations. They begin roughly as ballads, before off-time drums, thundering like distant artillery, rattle the pop scaffolding loose. We try to predict the next twist, how Noriko will dynamite whatever ornate façade she's been hand-crafting carefully before us.With the opening track's overlapping evolutions-- from whispery sing-speak into delicate coos into multitracked echoes, from clicks and knocks into shakers and rewound samples-- we should have been prepared for the zigzagged road ahead. Noriko is too inventive, too capricious, or simply too short on concentration, for our sluggish brains to catch up."

If the buzz sends you to MySpace, you'll get their impact but not their dynamics. Catch one of their cramped live shows and you'll get their in-it-to-win-it intensity but not their expansiveness. Hear their self-released EP, and you're getting closer-- besides existing at the cross-section of so many styles, the disc finds the band at a more important nexus of potential and realization. In person, Crystal Antlers look like outcasts from six different bands, and at various points on this record, they sound like it, too: Merging psych, garage, lo-fi, prog, and countless other influences, the group easily maintains consistency despite a complete inability to be pinned to any specific movement or trend (so long as you're not counting the increasingly frustrating trend of unimaginative bandnames).You might come across comparisons to Les Savy Fav, an appropriate call if you consider it shorthand for ""relentlessly energetic band with crowd-pleasing stage antics."" EP's opener ""A Thousand Eyes"" is evidence enough of that: Beginning with doomy, lo-fi minor arpeggios, it soon explodes into a Latin-influenced rumble before the band piledrives into a swaggering psych hook, the track sounds something like if Comets on Fire inverted their ratio of chaos-to-craft. Beneath the squall, ""Vexation""'s headsnapping pace and flesh-searing bass riff could be a Stooges-style punk shoutalong. The organ riff that ""Owl"" pogos on is a found relic from late-1960s Venice Beach with a monolithic vocal melody. And like any long-haired throwback worth its bongos, EP ends with the loosest and longest number, the seven-minute swamp lurch of ""Parting Song for the Torn Sky"".As much as it diverges from the brain-frying aim of typical psych-rock outings, EP is an unorthodox summer record-- not so much for driving to the beach as actually being in its sweltering grasp, equal parts scorched earth and wide open spaces. Credit to producer Ikey Owens (aka Mars Volta's keyboardist-- there's hope!) for finding enough room for every instrument, few of which act in their traditional scope. If you find yourself humming any of the riffs, odds are they'll come from singer Jonny Bell, who treats his bass like a six-string while guitar (check the appropriate titanic ""Arcturus"") and organ provide shading under an ozone of reverb that, like early My Morning Jacket, gives an impression of an expansive soundworld the band can grow into.It's tempting to be patient and call this disc a stopgap on the way to a triumphant debut full-length. But EP is plenty substantial as is; at 25 minutes, it's only a few shy of Nouns or, more to the point, any number of psych-rock classics from decades past. Of course, if you're still waiting on further evidence of how much there is to like about these guys, consider that I waited until the end of this review to mention that their percussionist is named Sexual Chocolate."

OK, so this 10-track EP has an uninspiring title; instead, the Friedberger sibs saved their best ideas for their songs.","Okay, I'm done being a nice guy about this: If you don't like Blueberry Boat, I don't like you. It's no longer a matter of taste, other than the fact that I have good taste, whereas you, Fiery Furnaces-hater, do not. Don't have time to take in the full sweeping grandeur of Blueberry Boat's 80 minutes? I have no respect for your calendar priorities. To those who find their multiple-movement symphonies and keyboard-fetish arrangements overcooked, I feel only loathing, utter disdain, and approximately one tablespoon of pity! And for the few of you that cannot handle the frenetic uber-medley that is a Fiery Furnaces live set, I want to make provocative documentary films about your inept and offensive taste and take them on the festival circuit.But if my depraved fanboy rants and threats don't convince you, this here spartanly-titled EP just might. Dare you infidels bear witness as this collection of the Furnaces' assorted table scraps easily outshines most bands' main course? Not content to merely isolate the most accessible tune from their long players and ship a CD-R out to campus hundred-watts, Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger are prolific vinyl-pressers, releasing new or reinterpreted material betwixt and in conjunction with their albums. EP does the Soulseek virtual crate-digging for Furnaces devotees, collecting most of these odds and sods while wisely catching amnesia on their less-collectible Clash and Fall covers.I know of some misguided souls who find that the accoutrements of Blueberry Boat's three-ring concept album circus overwhelm any songcraft talents the siblings Friedberger originally exhibited on Gallowsbird's Bark, and for these people my hatred burns only slightly less bright. Nevertheless, EP starts off with a trilogy of tunes that should lay this ridiculous claim to rest, restoring their most recent single to its original director's cut. Running a little over 10 minutes, the suite simultaneously reminds the doubters of the Furnaces' considerable pop abilities, while not compromising on the Casio blitzes or thematic density of more recent work.If ""Single Again"", in a slightly expanded take, remains a bit cold in with its jump-rope chant refrain and stiff drums, reinstated bridge ""Here Comes the Summer"", is the perfect thaw, showcasing the duo's deft hand with electronic rhythms, guitar pedals, and swooning melodies. ""Summer"" seasonally segues into ""Evergreen"", the band's sweetest ballad to date, and the first that comes close to making the Carpenters comparisons more than just commentary on the Friedberger's slightly creepy sibling dynamics.There's enough to digest in that opening salvo to fulfill the effort's modest title, but there's still a half-hour smattering of B-sides and remakes for dessert. A few (""Duffer St. George"", ""Smelling Cigarettes"") swerve towards the ADD collage style of Blueberry Boat's longer tracks, telling similarly intricate stories of infidelity, drinking, and gallivanting around London. Matthew's imaginary Cockney accent takes the lead more often than on the full-lengths, whether on the tongue-twisting sea shanty of ""Cousin Chris"" or the Bowie piano-rock of ""Sing for Me"".Meanwhile, the complete reconstruction of ""Tropical Ice-land"" featured here is a taste of the band's Dylan-like compulsion to perennially revise the back catalog, expanding the sing-songy original in every direction, right down to a wonderfully gratuitous backwards-vocal verse. In the end, it's perhaps this quality of perpetual evolution, best exemplified by their delirious live shows, that has me drawing Fiery Furnaces logos on my All-Stars-- few other bands of the indie world seem to have such mercurial aspirations.EP then comes off like a quick appendix to the band's work so far, concentrating their strengths in parts while elsewhere lovingly dumping the stray ideas that may not fit into their next conceptual flight.

His new album, amERICa, is rooted in classicist rock gestures but fixated on the contemporary United States. It isn’t complacent or satisfied; he anatomizes his surroundings with the wide-eyed thrill of discovery.","""Several Shades of Green"", the opener on Wreckless Eric’s amERICa, is flush with memories of ""the hit parade,"" feckless backing musicians, and silly jackets recommended by magazine stylists. The music—a spare backbeat and bass guitar lollygag, busied by skittish piano runs and a modest choral section—belies the ragged, bemused delivery of an artist reflecting on his time as a journeyman power-pop artist on Stiff Records in the late 1970s. ""If I’d known then, what I know now,"" goes the chorus—but it’s a tease. He stops and snickers at the temptation. That nimble maneuver—to reminisce, but jettison nostalgia—makes it a great opener for amERICa, an album rooted in classicist rock gestures but fixated on the contemporary United States.Wreckless Eric, born Eric Goulden, wrote a lot of songs about the music industry. ""Take the Cash (K.A.S.H.)"", for instance, urged artists to get paid up front. And peers such as Nick Lowe memorably looked at the era’s intersection of fandom and commerce in songs such as ""I Love My Label"" and ""Rollers Show"", too. But Goulden’s return to the show business theme—which, perhaps because it seemed crass in the wake of punk, faded from rock lyricism forever and today thrives in rap—acknowledges the chasm of time between then and now. With distance, he gains lucidity.It’s the same with the Englishman’s observations of the United States, which are dappled in telling detail and really rather astute. ""White Bread"", for instance, looks at the normalized delusions of a Middle America gun nut. On the rustic ""Sysco Trucks"", Goulden hovers over the wholesale food business: remote diners, kitchens, and markets all stocked with the same goods. There’s a critique implied, if not of capitalism at large then at least of monopoly and its subtly unsettling consequences for common cuisine. As he lightly notes, ""Everything we’re eating comes from somewhere."" The slaphappy typography ""amERICa"" is a bad indicator of Goulden’s tone; he’s mistily allusive, often playful, but never ham-fisted.Wreckless Eric recorded amERICa at home in upstate New York. He played many of the instruments himself. The palm-muted guitars and roaring refrains of his old work remain, but the record is more reserved and instilled with zany, fanciful flourishes. Goulden rarely grasps for big, beaming hooks. Instead, reverse reverb and spectral keys temper his creaky, pliable voice. And that blurred, homespun atmosphere makes amERICa sound modern; it puts him in league with bedroom revivalists such as Home Blitz, who ply weirder, less commercially aspirant versions of Wreckless Eric’s classic power-pop sound.Many artists of Wreckless Eric’s era and tradition have imitators, but few of yesteryear’s outliers can catch up with their descendants, let alone best them. amERICa is that rare record. Goulden is grownup, with all of the stereotypical benefits: an air of wisdom, emotional texture, and, perhaps most cliché of all, a seasoned voice. And yet, amERICa isn’t complacent or satisfied; Wreckless Eric anatomizes his surroundings with the wide-eyed thrill of discovery. His American flyover reveals simmering cultural disturbances and essential beauty alike—a late capitalist hellscape beneath ""Bobbie Gentry’s Mississippi skies."""

If the buzz sends you to MySpace, you'll get their impact but not their dynamics. Catch one of their cramped live shows and you'll get their in-it-to-win-it intensity but not their expansiveness. Hear their self-released EP, and you're getting closer-- besides existing at the cross-section of so many styles, the disc finds the band at a more important nexus of potential and realization. In person, Crystal Antlers look like outcasts from six different bands, and at various points on this record, they sound like it, too: Merging psych, garage, lo-fi, prog, and countless other influences, the group easily maintains consistency despite a complete inability to be pinned to any specific movement or trend (so long as you're not counting the increasingly frustrating trend of unimaginative bandnames).You might come across comparisons to Les Savy Fav, an appropriate call if you consider it shorthand for ""relentlessly energetic band with crowd-pleasing stage antics."" EP's opener ""A Thousand Eyes"" is evidence enough of that: Beginning with doomy, lo-fi minor arpeggios, it soon explodes into a Latin-influenced rumble before the band piledrives into a swaggering psych hook, the track sounds something like if Comets on Fire inverted their ratio of chaos-to-craft. Beneath the squall, ""Vexation""'s headsnapping pace and flesh-searing bass riff could be a Stooges-style punk shoutalong. The organ riff that ""Owl"" pogos on is a found relic from late-1960s Venice Beach with a monolithic vocal melody. And like any long-haired throwback worth its bongos, EP ends with the loosest and longest number, the seven-minute swamp lurch of ""Parting Song for the Torn Sky"".As much as it diverges from the brain-frying aim of typical psych-rock outings, EP is an unorthodox summer record-- not so much for driving to the beach as actually being in its sweltering grasp, equal parts scorched earth and wide open spaces. Credit to producer Ikey Owens (aka Mars Volta's keyboardist-- there's hope!) for finding enough room for every instrument, few of which act in their traditional scope. If you find yourself humming any of the riffs, odds are they'll come from singer Jonny Bell, who treats his bass like a six-string while guitar (check the appropriate titanic ""Arcturus"") and organ provide shading under an ozone of reverb that, like early My Morning Jacket, gives an impression of an expansive soundworld the band can grow into.It's tempting to be patient and call this disc a stopgap on the way to a triumphant debut full-length. But EP is plenty substantial as is; at 25 minutes, it's only a few shy of Nouns or, more to the point, any number of psych-rock classics from decades past. Of course, if you're still waiting on further evidence of how much there is to like about these guys, consider that I waited until the end of this review to mention that their percussionist is named Sexual Chocolate."

OK, so this 10-track EP has an uninspiring title; instead, the Friedberger sibs saved their best ideas for their songs.","Okay, I'm done being a nice guy about this: If you don't like Blueberry Boat, I don't like you. It's no longer a matter of taste, other than the fact that I have good taste, whereas you, Fiery Furnaces-hater, do not. Don't have time to take in the full sweeping grandeur of Blueberry Boat's 80 minutes? I have no respect for your calendar priorities. To those who find their multiple-movement symphonies and keyboard-fetish arrangements overcooked, I feel only loathing, utter disdain, and approximately one tablespoon of pity! And for the few of you that cannot handle the frenetic uber-medley that is a Fiery Furnaces live set, I want to make provocative documentary films about your inept and offensive taste and take them on the festival circuit.But if my depraved fanboy rants and threats don't convince you, this here spartanly-titled EP just might. Dare you infidels bear witness as this collection of the Furnaces' assorted table scraps easily outshines most bands' main course? Not content to merely isolate the most accessible tune from their long players and ship a CD-R out to campus hundred-watts, Eleanor and Matthew Friedberger are prolific vinyl-pressers, releasing new or reinterpreted material betwixt and in conjunction with their albums. EP does the Soulseek virtual crate-digging for Furnaces devotees, collecting most of these odds and sods while wisely catching amnesia on their less-collectible Clash and Fall covers.I know of some misguided souls who find that the accoutrements of Blueberry Boat's three-ring concept album circus overwhelm any songcraft talents the siblings Friedberger originally exhibited on Gallowsbird's Bark, and for these people my hatred burns only slightly less bright. Nevertheless, EP starts off with a trilogy of tunes that should lay this ridiculous claim to rest, restoring their most recent single to its original director's cut. Running a little over 10 minutes, the suite simultaneously reminds the doubters of the Furnaces' considerable pop abilities, while not compromising on the Casio blitzes or thematic density of more recent work.If ""Single Again"", in a slightly expanded take, remains a bit cold in with its jump-rope chant refrain and stiff drums, reinstated bridge ""Here Comes the Summer"", is the perfect thaw, showcasing the duo's deft hand with electronic rhythms, guitar pedals, and swooning melodies. ""Summer"" seasonally segues into ""Evergreen"", the band's sweetest ballad to date, and the first that comes close to making the Carpenters comparisons more than just commentary on the Friedberger's slightly creepy sibling dynamics.There's enough to digest in that opening salvo to fulfill the effort's modest title, but there's still a half-hour smattering of B-sides and remakes for dessert. A few (""Duffer St. George"", ""Smelling Cigarettes"") swerve towards the ADD collage style of Blueberry Boat's longer tracks, telling similarly intricate stories of infidelity, drinking, and gallivanting around London. Matthew's imaginary Cockney accent takes the lead more often than on the full-lengths, whether on the tongue-twisting sea shanty of ""Cousin Chris"" or the Bowie piano-rock of ""Sing for Me"".Meanwhile, the complete reconstruction of ""Tropical Ice-land"" featured here is a taste of the band's Dylan-like compulsion to perennially revise the back catalog, expanding the sing-songy original in every direction, right down to a wonderfully gratuitous backwards-vocal verse. In the end, it's perhaps this quality of perpetual evolution, best exemplified by their delirious live shows, that has me drawing Fiery Furnaces logos on my All-Stars-- few other bands of the indie world seem to have such mercurial aspirations.EP then comes off like a quick appendix to the band's work so far, concentrating their strengths in parts while elsewhere lovingly dumping the stray ideas that may not fit into their next conceptual flight. That it still manages to skirt the hazards of being a for-fan's-only release only deepens my stalker-love, not to mention the accompanying abhorrence for all who don't see the light.

Trying to move beyond that supporting role, he loads his sixth solo album with big-time producers, skits, and careful introspection.","Royce 5’9” (formerly Royce da 5’9”) has done a lot of his most visible rapping as a plus-one. His first appearance for many was on Eminem’s The Slim Shady LP as one half of Bad Meets Evil on a song of the same name. He caught his second wind years later as one of the senior members of the major label castoff Voltron that is Slaughterhouse (with Joe Budden, Crooked I, and Joell Ortiz). Most recently, he’s functioned as DJ Premier’s rapping partner in PRhyme. Royce is an excellent supporting character, but things never came together for any of his solo records, which tend to drag.His sixth studio album, Layers, isn’t much different, albeit not for lack of trying. Royce checks all the boxes on paper here, fully loading it with big-time producers, skits, and tons of careful introspection, the typical keys to a success for any traditionalist rap album. But this lyrical marathon falls short by any conceivable benchmark, unable to really get going or sustain momentum until the very end. There’s also plenty of rapping about how good at rapping he is, which is almost always boring.The main difference between Layers and past Royce records is supposed to be the newfound commitment to full-fledged storytelling, and it’s easy to hear those gears turning on songs like ""Startercoat"" and ""Misses."" On the former, he defends 2Pac's place in history, in response to the omission on Billboard's Greatest Rappers of All-Time list from last year (“If Pac ain’t on your list then you ain’t fucking logical”), using a UNLV Starter jacket as a symbol for the influence Pac had on him. On ""Misses,"" he writes about his relationship with his wife, implying it’s difficult being a married rapper. While these are functional stories with interesting plot points, they also prove he has a knack for overthinking (and oversharing), which torpedoes some of the strongest technical rapping on Layers. On “Tabernacle,” he tells the heartbreaking story of losing his grandmother and meeting his newborn son within hours at the same hospital. But he is incapable of building suspense or changing his tone, and what should be an epic tale is reduced to the songwriting equivalent of turn-by-turn navigation—taking readable steps toward a predetermined destination. He’s prone to rapping in bulk, and thus wants to narrate every detail of a story in a linear timetable, telegraphing outcomes; sometimes it’s like a nonfiction book on tape."

When the pandemic began, she decamped to her family’s home in Maine, where she reconnected with nature and wrote a collection of songs called Surrender—which is also the name of her 2022 Harvard Divinity School thesis. Oh yeah: While working on the follow-up to her 2019 debut Heard It in a Past Life, Rogers was enrolled in a year-long masters program focused on the presence of religion in public life. For the 28-year-old singer-scholar that meant considering questions like: Does an artist hold a responsibility to their audience? And how can performance be a conduit for a transcendental experience?If it sounds a little Ivy League Hannah Montana—finals by day, Met Gala by night—Rogers’ return to academia served her well. On Surrender, she sounds renewed, submitting to the pull of her heart without apology. She plays hooky from adulthood on the upbeat “Be Cool” and gives into her carnal instincts on “Want Want”; she’s turning off the radio and listening to the wind instead of suffering through “that song I’m supposed to know/By some fucking bro,” as she teases on “Anywhere With You.” She’s still processing her whirlwind rise to fame, and learning what to prioritize: “Took me all this long to figure out/It’s not worth it/If I can’t touch the ground,” she sings on the ballad “Horses,” which uses the titular animals as a symbol for the freedom she so badly desires.The album itself reflects Rogers’ newfound autonomy: She’s trimmed back on her debut’s stable of producers, co-producing Surrender herself alongside Kid Harpoon (Harry Styles, Shawn Mendes). One of the best moments, the escapist fantasy “Anywhere With You,” was co-written with an old friend, Holden Jaffe, who makes music under the name Del Water Gap (Rogers performed in an earlier version of the project while in college). On the song, Rogers lifts a companion out of their existential malaise before the pair hit the road in search of something bigger than themselves. Like so many road songs, it’s also a declaration of devotion, a commitment to journeying forward together even as their thoughts on forever differ: “You tell me you want everything you want it fast,” Rogers bellows atop a cathartic crescendo that would not sound out of place on an early Arcade Fire record. “But all I’ve ever wanted is to make something/Fucking last.”"

Maybe last year's DJ mix album, the reasonably decent Brothers Gonna Work It Out, should have been the clue, but Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons have clearly been raiding a library- sized record collection since their last offering of ""original"" music.""Music: Response,"" the album's leadoff, starts like a ride on the Autobahn with Kraftwerk circa the mid '70s, with its analog synth blips and monotone computerwelt voices, before tossing in some ferocious beats to bring Krautrock into the new millennium. The mood carries through on ""Under the Influence"" with more Kraftwerk- styled noodlings. Meanwhile, their best instrumental effort is ""The Sunshine Underground,"" an eight- and- a- half minute ride through chiming tones, wafting flute- like sounds, and sputtering and gurgling synths that intertwine with the briefest of dreamy vocals. Actually, it wouldn't have been out of place on the last Orbital album.Surrender will receive a ton of hype based on its superstar guest appearances, and none more historically relevant than ""Out of Control"" with New Order's Bernard Sumner on vocals. Being electronic dance music freaks from Manchester, New Order is like the holy grail to the Chemical Brothers and it's easy to see why. The Chemicals share with their Manchester predecessors an obsession with hypnotic, melodic, dance beats. ""Out of Control"" works so well it could be a lost track from Low Life. After his turn on ""Setting Son"" with the Chemicals in 1996, Oasis' terminally out- of- style Noel Gallagher returns for another psychedelic, Beatles-esque anthem on ""Let Forever Be,"" again snagging the rhythm track from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" off Revolver.Surrender is both the Chemical Brothers most immediately satisfying work and, perhaps not coincidentally, the most like a rock album of their career. Unlike a fair share of techno, these songs feel like ""songs,"" not a collection of clever samples and a race to the fastest BPM on the planet. Yeah, you can go out and buy your jungle, your trance, your trip-hop and your ambient, but why would you when you'd be sacrificing the greatest gift of all: Surrender's love and understanding."
2kz1YOhJiNubjigR1gB1VX,0.795,94.969,0.845,latin,-3.502,0.224,0.681,Rauw Alejandro,4.0,0.0681,81,playa saturno,Reggaeton Hits,DILUVIO,1.78e-05,0.0,9.0,0.343,reggaeton,6.5,The Puerto Rican hitmaker attempts to replicate the magic of his celestial 2022 album in this summery spinoff but winds up lost in space.,"With Saturn transiting the water sign of Pisces for the next few years, it’s fitting that Rauw Alejandro’s 2022 album SATURNO found its way to the beach. The blue-haired bad boy from the Puerto Rican city of Carolina, who has a penchant for panty-dropping falsettos and ’90s-style flows, built his name making clubby reggaeton just different enough to be interesting. The music is about ass-shaking, yes, but it’s always accompanied by compelling details: a leftfield synth loop, an electric guitar riff worthy of a rock en español track, a Baby Rasta and Gringo interpolation that shows Alejandro’s ear is finely tuned to the old school.SATURNO was a playful maelstrom of these influences, a concept album that positioned the Puerto Rican star, who donned a chic cyberpunk aesthetic for the release, as an experimental and meticulous presence. He set the bar as an unconventional mainstream reggaetonero, both in his own work and in collaborations (take Tainy’s recent producer project DATA, where Alejandro goes back and forth effortlessly with Skrillex and Four Tet). His crooning tenor is one of the prettier voices among the Olympus of pop reggaeton titans, and his moves are unmatched; just ask the Jabbawockeez, the iconic masked hip-hop crew who spent the last few months breakdancing alongside Alejandro on tour. On PLAYA SATURNO, envisioned as a “spinoff” of its celestially minded predecessor, Alejandro attempts to stretch the stardust to the tune of 14 new songs. Unfortunately dampened by filler tracks, the album winds up lost in space.For starters, many of the collaborations struggle to live up to their promise. Alejandro’s reliably excellent vocal performances, full of careening vocoder belting and enviably erotic delivery, are still not enough to bring everything together. On lead single “Si te pegas,” Spanish pop icon Miguel Bosé makes a treasured appearance after eight years of vocal difficulties. But rather than a legendary comeback, Bosé’s feature feels tacked-on; his famously velveteen voice shines briefly before he drowns in an ocean of tepid keys and snare rolls. Guanajuato’s golden boy Junior H makes an appearance on “Picardía,” but doesn’t indulge in the relaxed drawl that makes corrido tumbado so powerful. Instead of a potentially exciting cross-genre moment, the rising Mexican star is squashed into a copy-paste feature that could have been spit by anyone.This is not to say there aren’t showstoppers. The Ivy Queen feature “Celebrando,” a deliciously disjointed electro-perreo that spotlights her distinctive snarl and interpolates the iconic harpsichord of her signature song “Quiero bailar,” feels like an intentional co-sign of El Zorro by La Caballota. Jowell & Randy’s appearance on the appropriately named “Ponte nasty,” a horny anthem with a dembow beat straight out of a sweaty marquesina, adds a touch of grime to one of the hardest tracks at this cosmic beach bash. “I want to fuck her/She wants to fuck me,” Alejandro breathily rasps in English, tapping into the cheeky confidence that makes him so irresistible.Alejandro’s Bizarrap session, released last month, closes the album on a high note. After a slog of generic beats built for the background music of the afters, long after anyone has stopped listening, it feels unearned. Not even Kenobi Sensei’s ever-shiny production, which has bolstered Alejandro from the start, can make PLAYA SATURNO stand on its own; nor can experiments like the downtempo reggae track “No me sorprende.” Without a framework that allows the real gems to shine, PLAYA SATURNO is just another party album, a chart-chasing reggaeton offering that could move bodies on the dancefloor, but won’t move the needle. It feels imprecise to think of this album as a true sequel to SATURNO, even though it was crafted as a continuation. If the initial record harnessed the energy of the planet, this collection more closely resembles Saturn’s rings: a shiny decoration of ice and dust held in place by the gravity of a more substantial body."

YHLQMDLG, released in March, flirted with the top of the pops and dominated the Latin charts; he’s graced awards-show stages and the covers of Western media’s storied publications; he’s evolved into a vocal ally of marginalized communities, with a willingness to acknowledge and rectify his mistakes; and with the release of El Último Tour Del Mundo, he’s made history with the first-ever No. 1 Spanish-language album on Billboard’s album chart. No other artist had more Spotify streams in 2020.For El Último Tour Del Mundo, Bad Bunny transports himself a decade into the future, imagining the music he’d play on his final world tour in 2030. It’s not his best record, but that’s almost beside the point. You’ll still find vestiges of his particular nuevo reggaetón sound on tracks like “Te Mudaste” and “Dákiti,” even if the latter is one of its weakest examples, pummeling the dembow riddim into submission with a thumping four-on-the-floor that’s devoid of any actual flavor. But by track four he takes a sharp left turn from the rap and perreo that defined previous LPs in favor of a morose, introspective vibe that pulls from British post-punk and the rock en español of Central and South America as much as it does the hip-hop and R&B of the American South.For better or worse, El Ultimó Tour Del Mundo’s rock sound leans heavily on producer Marco “MAG” Borrero (and, to a lesser extent, Borrero’s human riff machine Mick Coogan), best known for crafting pop hits for the likes of Flo Rida, Bebe Rexha, and Selena Gomez. The collaboration doesn’t always work; tracks like “Te Deseo Lo Mejor” and “Antes Que Se Acabe” suffer from a saccharine sound that’s generic enough to blend in with Top 40 radio.

Their 1994 hit “Lamento Boliviano” was drenched in self-medication and singer/bassist Marciano Cantero’s romantic pathos offered the kind of lyrics that get screamed back at you when sung to packed stadiums: “Y yo estoy aquí, borracho y loco (And here I am, drunk and crazy)/Y mi corazón idiota, siempre brillará” (And my idiot heart, always shining). For J Balvin, Sky flipped part of the original hook to turn Balvin from the heartbroken to the heartbreaker: “Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará” (“And your idiot heart will always miss me”). Over the course of a single day, what began as a half-serious gag—what if we got Cantero in the booth?—ended with a phone call from the Argentine asking for stems. “It was kind of a joke in the studio,” Sky told Rolling Stone. “But they take the jokes very seriously.”“Un Peso” captures the appeal of Oasis; frothy music made by serious talents. The reigning princes of urbano spend much of the album’s 31-minute runtime promoting tropical hedonist pursuits: too-tiny bikinis, excessive alcohol consumption, ostentatious displays of wealth, and unprotected sex. They bro down over dembow beats and pack as many dancing women as possible into their music videos. It’s goofy, but incredibly fun—a soundtrack for beach BBQs and ad hoc fire-hydrant water parks, summer vibes made manifest.The risk of not taking yourself too seriously is that plenty of the lyrics reveal themselves to be cringe-worthy upon close inspection—“Voy pa’ adentro como Pelé (¡Gol!),” or, “I’m going inside you like Pelé (Goal!),” Balvin sings on “Mojaita”—and much of the record can best be described as ’manos being ’manos. When Bad Bunny sings lines like “Ese booty es un paraíso como Bora Bora” (“The booty is a paradise like Bora Bora”), you can almost hear him smirk. It’s par for the course for the handful of the duo’s pre-Oasis collaborations, and whether you find this charming or gross likely hinges on your capacity for the crassness prevalent in much of urban music of any language.Of the two stars, it’s the 25-year-old Bad Bunny whose voice looms largest on Oasis. His nasal Auto-Tune croon christens every song he appears on, regardless of the style he’s working with. The 34-year-old Balvin, ever the chameleonic wave-rider, is more content to go with the flow. Balvin verses can often feel like guest features on his own records—look no further than Beyoncé’s star turn on the “Mi Gente” remix—or as in the case of “Un Peso,” are sometimes written by someone else."

Its infectious vibe is draped in dancehall with a dash of trap production and nods to salsa, bachata, and Afrobeat.","On his first trips to America as a precocious teen, Colombia’s J Balvin didn’t necessarily understand all the words in the pop songs he fell in love with. But he knew how they made him feel, and he’s been trying to bottle that feeling with his music ever since.The reggaetonero’s global success has dovetailed with the surge of reggaetón’s popularity in his home of Medellin, Colombia. The scene there has helped bring the genre back into the mainstream, often by taking a more suave approach to a traditionally explicit and misogynist aesthetic, not unlike his contemporary Maluma. But the 33-year-old Balvin has his sights set higher than just being the supreme reggaetonero romántico. And on his latest album, Vibras, we’re finally getting a clear picture of what that sounds like.Vibras, or “vibes” in Spanish, is defiantly Latin, but it is also in direct conversation with what’s happening in American pop—especially the pop that draws its direct ancestry from hip-hop. If it’s no longer important for rappers to be skilled lyricists, then the vibe rules supreme. Can you ride the beat? Can you nail the melody and make people move? If you can, it really doesn’t matter what words are said. Just set the vibe.This aligns well with J Balvin’s plans for world domination. If the words are less important than the vibe, then why should the language matter? While Vibras is rooted in reggaetón, the beats are draped in dancehall and a dash of trap production techniques, with nods to salsa, bachata, and Afrobeat. Even for an American audience, it’s hard to classify this as global music when it often feels strangely familiar.Much of it is produced by Alejandro “Sky” Ramirez and Marco “Tainy” Masis, the former a frequent Balvin collaborator and the latter a Puerto Rican production powerhouse who broke out with Luny Tunes’ Mas Flow: Los Benjamins. They freak beats with roots in flamenco (”Brillo”), toy with some Afrobeat influence (”En Mi,” “Tu Verdad”), and even somehow to flip a dembow beat into a romantic ballad with a little twinge of guitar (”No Es Justo”). Balvin’s duet with Willy William, “Mi Gente,” was one of last summer’s biggest hits, and rocketed into the mainstream when Beyoncé jumped on the remix, prompted by her 6-year-old daughter’s love for the song. And while Vibras certainly sounds like the future of reggaetón, Balvin’s global reach might best be evidenced by album closer “Machika,” which sees Suriname’s DJ Chuckie contribute a little bit of the up-tempo Dutch-Caribbean dancehall style known as “bubbling.”"

Their 1994 hit “Lamento Boliviano” was drenched in self-medication and singer/bassist Marciano Cantero’s romantic pathos offered the kind of lyrics that get screamed back at you when sung to packed stadiums: “Y yo estoy aquí, borracho y loco (And here I am, drunk and crazy)/Y mi corazón idiota, siempre brillará” (And my idiot heart, always shining). For J Balvin, Sky flipped part of the original hook to turn Balvin from the heartbroken to the heartbreaker: “Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará” (“And your idiot heart will always miss me”). Over the course of a single day, what began as a half-serious gag—what if we got Cantero in the booth?—ended with a phone call from the Argentine asking for stems. “It was kind of a joke in the studio,” Sky told Rolling Stone. “But they take the jokes very seriously.”“Un Peso” captures the appeal of Oasis; frothy music made by serious talents. The reigning princes of urbano spend much of the album’s 31-minute runtime promoting tropical hedonist pursuits: too-tiny bikinis, excessive alcohol consumption, ostentatious displays of wealth, and unprotected sex. They bro down over dembow beats and pack as many dancing women as possible into their music videos. It’s goofy, but incredibly fun—a soundtrack for beach BBQs and ad hoc fire-hydrant water parks, summer vibes made manifest.The risk of not taking yourself too seriously is that plenty of the lyrics reveal themselves to be cringe-worthy upon close inspection—“Voy pa’ adentro como Pelé (¡Gol!),” or, “I’m going inside you like Pelé (Goal!),” Balvin sings on “Mojaita”—and much of the record can best be described as ’manos being ’manos. When Bad Bunny sings lines like “Ese booty es un paraíso como Bora Bora” (“The booty is a paradise like Bora Bora”), you can almost hear him smirk. It’s par for the course for the handful of the duo’s pre-Oasis collaborations, and whether you find this charming or gross likely hinges on your capacity for the crassness prevalent in much of urban music of any language.Of the two stars, it’s the 25-year-old Bad Bunny whose voice looms largest on Oasis. His nasal Auto-Tune croon christens every song he appears on, regardless of the style he’s working with. The 34-year-old Balvin, ever the chameleonic wave-rider, is more content to go with the flow.

Its cultural impact has been palpable, legitimizing a genre historically pushed to the margins, branded vulgar and low-class by the upper crust of Latin American society. Pop charts freed from gatekeepers in terrestrial radio are now dominated by the reggaetón riddim, so much so that some of its biggest stars make great strides to embrace grittier sounds more in line with the sound’s underground origins. But most artists still feel pressured to stick to the formula, churning out generic reggaetóncitos until they have enough clout to experiment and find their voice.So for Rauw Alejandro, a nascent pop star with gifts as a singer and dancer surpassing most of his contemporaries—including bellwethers Bad Bunny and J Balvin—the challenge becomes not how to get reggaetón on the charts, but how to get on the charts without making reggaetón. And indeed, while Alejandro dabbled in some new directions on his debut LP Afrodisíaco, much of that record hewed closer to the watered-down reggaetón and trap that dominates the Latin charts. Yet its success has emboldened him to further experiment on his latest LP, Vice Versa, albeit with mixed results.For better or worse, Vice Versa is presented distinctly in Alejandro’s voice; historically a prolific collaborator, he largely eschews features. Outside of Anitta’s turn on “Brazilera,” the most prominent guest on the record might just be the Daddy Yankee sample on “La Old Skul.” Alejandro is also listed as a producer on five of Vice Versa’s 14 tracks, evidence that his confidence in his own vision extends behind the boards, too.The most forceful example of this is album opener “Todo De Ti,” his declaration that he is veering from the standard pop formula du jour—the Latin one, at least. And while it’s certainly a surprising direction for a young artist who came up on reggaetón and Trap&B, it’s also somewhat dispiriting that the big tonal shift comes from a track that would sound more at home on the boring half of a Dua Lipa LP, a lifestyle ad in audio form with a saccharine melody that appears to be lifted from Fergie’s biggest hit. “Desenfocao’” feels modeled after the contemporary Weeknd, softening a Michael Jackson-via-Max Martin take on rock music with a slick pop sheen.This expanded range has also yielded some fascinating results, mostly at the higher tempos. After hinting at an affinity for Euro club music on Afrodisíaco’s “Quimica,” he further experiments here with UK rave and drum’n’bass. “Cosa Guapa” begins innocently enough as a standard pop reggaetón, then teleports to the floor at Fabric; “¿Cuándo Fue?” lulls listeners in with familiar syncopation before dropping them into a vortex of skittering snares and deep, pulsing synthesized bass. It’s the most thrilling moment on the record, an injection of unbridled energy that fades much too quickly."

He no longer finds any value in the accidental click-and-pop that once signified recorded entropy and fractured reality. Just like the sound of running water that appeared on every ambient disc ten years ago, clicks and glitches have lost all potency. They're now just another preset sound.Endrass's Vice Versa, however, is not a wholesale return to the time before glitch. That sound is in the album, yet Endrass has reformatted it. Vice Versa, unlike Mouse on Mars' Idiology or Posthuman's Uncertainty of the Monkey, revels not in contrast or juxtaposition, but rather in interchangeability. Elements don't jar; they become subjugated to Endrass' harmonic concept.Vice Versa is a very confident album. It's a brave musician who kicks off an album with a fourteen-minute track. Yet Endrass' bravery is far from hubris. He produced over thirty vinyl releases before he issued his debut long-player, Infam, in 2001. Unfortunately, Endrass limited his vinyl productions to about 300 copes per title, and consequently, the Markant name was known more by reputation than by experience.Endrass, answering only to himself, begins Vice Versa in a digital haze reminiscent of a cloud of well-meaning mosquitoes dancing about your ears. After nearly four minutes, the harmonic and melodic elements of the opening track, ""Spurwechsel,"" emerge. It's as though he's cleansing the listener in anticipation of the Markant concept of music.Fortunately, Endrass has the skills to match his boast. Vice Versa abounds in idiosyncratic and original melodic twists, dips, dives, and arches. Unlike Mouse on Mars who sometimes disguise their tunes in offbeat programming or Venusian ska-otica, Endrass doesn't parade prodigious programming abilities. Like Galerie Stratique or Isan, Endrass would rather expend energy on increasing the vocabulary of melody rather than gene-splicing sound.Initially, I bemoaned the lack of sonic innovation, but after many listens, I've become more fascinated with the sedate glass harmonica beauty of ""Natura Morte"" and the glacial drift of the title track. You might say that Geir Jensen (aka Biosphere) definitively mapped out this territory with 1997's Substrata, or that Thomas Köner took ambience to its bleak extreme with 1998's Kaamos. And you could say that ""Deserto"" compares just as favorably to Amber-era Autechre, or that ""Laissez Faire"" sounds like Global Communications' mechanized excursions under the Reload moniker. And I couldn't even disagree with you. But I would retort that no one should visit a place just once. Endrass' terrain may be familiar, but his assessment of them is utterly his own."

Miller’s 2016 effort The Divine Feminine was recorded closely with Grande and doubled as a love letter to the woman he’d hitched his star to. He’s gone from “you and me against the world” to just “me against the world,” and as much as he tries to convince himself that’s almost as good on his warm but wounded fifth album, Swimming, he knows it’s not.At its lightest, Swimming plays a little like Mac Miller’s own Forgetting Sarah Marshall, an amiable account of involuntary bachelorhood. “I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever, keep my shit together,” he ambles over an aloof beat on “Smaller Worlds.” On “What’s the Use,” he shrugs off his foibles over some buoyant roller-disco, accompanied by low-key vocal assists from Snoop Dogg and Thundercat. Miller’s flow is limber and self-deprecating; he tries any pattern of singing or rapping that might lift his spirits for a few seconds. He’s doing his best to find the humor in a situation that isn’t really funny, as his arrest for a DUI and hit and run this May made all too clear.Miller has long been open about his struggles with addiction, which Grande cited in her decision to end what she called a “toxic relationship.” But those looking for any dirt-dishing or ax-grinding on Swimming will be disappointed. “Everybody want a headline, I don’t got nothin’ to say,” he rapped on “Programs,” a loose track from May with more of a chip on its shoulder than any that made the album. Even at Swimming’s bleakest—“Self Care/Oblivion,” a dispiriting account of his pain-numbing regime, or “Hurt Feelings,” which shines some light on his mental state during that DUI—Miller resists the suggestion that anybody in particular is to blame for him bottoming out. The furthest he’ll go is acknowledging life was a lot easier with Grande than without her. “She put me back together when I was out of order,” he admits on “Perfecto.”This sort of heartsick longing is not exactly something new—in 2018, you can’t toss a stone without it landing in some chart-topping sad rapper’s styrofoam cup. But Miller explores his headspace with considerably more focus than Drake, Future, or Post Malone, artists who sometimes cut emotional corners in their rush to the next banger. An album with nothing but time on its hands and an understanding that healing is a slow, tedious process, Swimming is most engaging when it details the simple things Miller tells himself to keep his spirits up. “Every day I wake up and breathe/I don’t have it all but that’s all right with me,” he sighs on “2009,” even though he only sounds half-convinced.He’s come a long way since his overbearing kid brother act of his early Blue Slide Park days. Where he used to mug over his music relentlessly, on Swimming he mostly lets the beats breathe, clearing ample space for the record’s peaceful orchestral swells and blushing keyboards. He’s also singing more than ever, and he sounds better than ever doing it. Modest as it is, his voice is expressive in ways his plainspoken prose could never be, capturing his resignation without turning sadness into a performative spectacle.As always, Miller remains a step behind the prestige artists he emulates—Chance the Rapper, Anderson.Paak, and, increasingly, Frank Ocean, whose nonchalant songcraft looms large here. Swimming is less virtuosic than those artists’ recent works, but no less heartfelt, and the album’s wistful soul and warm funk fits Miller like his oldest, coziest hoodie. He may be unable to escape his own head, as he laments on the opener “Come Back to Earth,” but he’s decided to make himself as comfortable as possible while he’s trapped there."

Those adverbs have run their course, but here they describe a young band's maturation from victims of their scene and prisoners of their studio into a band willing to tinker with composition and to savor accident. Gone is the hip shtick of past outings, each riff and melody weighed down by polish and forethought. Now they've realized that fucking up is part of art. Rock'n'roll is all about romance and instinct, they say, and about the possibility of being betrayed by both. You have to risk it, risk error. As an Irish writer rightly assured himself: Mistakes can shove an artist toward discovery.The French Kicks discovered that they can peer inward. Maybe they're no longer burdened by the pressures to be a New York Band alongside the Strokes and the Walkmen, or by some duty to radiate tragedy and defibrillate post-punk. Production plays a large part in the band's turn to richer, larger emotions. Mixing and producing their new album, Swimming, has enabled them to wring truth and wrest intimacy from the sterile, unromantic process of music making in the laptop era. They bid adieu to the high-tech sheen of 2006's Two Thousand. It's a bravely nostalgic turn, to curb the impulse to digitally cut, paste, and Ctrl-Z your work until a radically reworked seventh take seems immaculately conceived.And that is how it seems. Swimming channels the medium-voltage jolt of the French Kicks' recent live appearances: not too much, not too little. Easing down a middle path, ""Abandon"" wipes away the memory of the New York bandwagons, and replaces it with rock's version of the way of all flesh: the ""growing up and mellowing out"" record. This is the rare case where this doesn't translate into soul-swallowing boredom. There's irony in the song title, as this Brooklyn lullaby is short on rebel wildness. But in another way, the title hits the target: The band is abandoning abandon. No more of that secondhand scorn of well-heeled kids trying to ape the Stooges or Gang of Four. Here the sass is concentrated in that pointy, chiming guitar line, only to be washed out, like a splotch of marinara, by the onrushing harmonies.Post-punkers who warm to ""Abandon"" will take to the equally jagged ""Love in the Ruins"". The cavernous bump of the percussion has not only a human warmth, courtesy of the roomy recordings, but a solidity that balances out all the weightless surroundings. Like clockwork, the bass drum tramples and thwacks, while the Talking Heads nod ""Carried Away"" soars and glistens. Along the same lines, swinging stick-work firmly grounds the Beach Boys breeze wafting through ""Atlanta"" and ""Said So What"".As Josh Wise and Nick Stumpf swap time at the microphone, their earthy falsettos-- evoking both a backwoods longing (""All Our Weekends"") and an urban malaise (""The Way You Arrive"")-- accomplish the bipolar task of launching the songs skyward and rooting them in the soil. Thick with both a springtime twinkle and autumnal heartache, Swimming makes good on the band's early promise. Trading layers of mood and melody and meaning for layers of Pro Tooled artifice, French Kicks have razored off the bullshit, leaving a core of beguilingly honest tunes."

With A.L.L.A.—executive produced by Yams, along with Danger Mouse and featuring Kanye, Lil Wayne, Future, and M.I.A. among others—a real sense of identity has begun to coalesce in Rocky’s work.","We are in the age of the curator, from meticulously-arranged, aspirational Tumblrs to Drake’s recent stint at Sotheby’s. As it’s grown easier to translate our identities through these careful assemblages of stuff we fuck with, good taste has taken on a new leveraging power. A$AP Rocky, the baby-faced fashion killa and primary figurehead of zeitgeist-wheelie-poppin’ Harlem goon squad A$AP Mob, has always understood this better than anyone else in the rap game. As he should: his own success can be directly traced to early promo on his mentor and A$AP Worldwide co-owner A$AP Yams’ highly influential RealNiggaTumblr, one of the savviest indie-to-major reconnaissance missions this century. That triumph of personal taste has been one of the reasons Rocky’s resonated most with this generation of rap fans and beyond, but it’s also led to his most persistent critique: all vibe, no substance. In between the conceptual Instagram stunts and Harry Potter-themed sartorial wisdom, it’s hard not to wonder about the Rakim Mayers beneath the swaggy labels, and if we’d ever get a lasting impression of his point of view beyond the infinite affirmations that it is, indeed, lit.There’s been a two-plus year gap between Rocky’s sophomore studio album, At.Long.Last.ASAP, and his chart-topping major label debut, during which he dabbled in fashion design, modeled for Ferragamo, and made his acting debut in Sundance darling Dope. But the most glaring change between then and now is the absence of Yams, or Steven Rodriguez, who died this January at 26 of a drug overdose. Yams’ presence was mostly behind-the-scenes (though he’d often appear in the videos, in all his jiggy splendor), but he was the heart and soul of the A$AP Mob, and Rocky’s success is no short of unfathomable without his guidance. With A.L.L.A.—executive produced by Yams, along with art-rap auteur Danger Mouse—he presents to the world one last relic of he and his best friend’s collaborative vision, and though the album was reportedly completed before Yams’ death, it still feels like an elegy to the closest thing the millennial generation had to its own Diddy or Dame Dash.Rocky remained understandably private in the aftermath of Yams’ passing, but on A.L.L.A., he seems more open than ever: to the healing properties of hallucinogens, to be sure, but also to revealing parts of his personality that go beyond surface-level. To an extent, this may reflect his recent antipathy towards the much-hyped labels with which he once associated. But it seems more likely a result of growing up, gaining steadier footing in the industry his squad gate-crashed, and coming to terms with himself as more than just a sum of his inspirations and logos. At long last, a real sense of identity has begun to coalesce in Rocky’s work."

Through her use of virtual reality, you were beside her as she crawled out of a cave and danced at dawn lakeside; you swirled inside her mouth or moved into her sherbert-neon computer-generated body. It was intimate to see and feel her isolation, her heartbreak, and ultimately her healing as she sewed up a wound in her chest and walked away. The final statement of Vulnicura’s sweeping narrative about ending a relationship with her longtime partner was that after all this, Björk was finally alone.It’s easier to create a utopia in isolation. If only we didn’t have this misbegotten, biologic desire to welcome someone else into our world. Another person? With me right now? I’m good, thanks. Yet most of us persist in this welcoming, an act that requires so much patience, compassion, and sacrifice because we believe that by co-organizing a perfect world for two, we might come closer to knowing love. Add to this small world a child and it seems like a miracle—a small paradise immune to the horrors outside of it. “If you feel this world is not heading the right way,” Björk said recently, “you have to be DIY and make a little fortress.” It’s within this matriarchal frame that Björk and her co-producer Alejandro Ghersi (aka Arca) created the challenging album Utopia. It’s a long, skittering discovery of googly-eyed romance, a rebuke of the violence inherited by men, and a generous offering of love song after love song, rendered musically with unerring elegance and passion.The four decades of Björk’s music can be seen, simply enough, as a long trek to detail every last tendril of spiritual energy and spark of emotion that has existed in the world. Her relationship to feeling is particularly spatial, living within environments built Björk-tough for all the screams and whispers of history: emotional landscapes, hidden places, internal nebulas, mutual coordinates. Her shift from avant-garde pop star to immersive multimedia artist is not brand-building in a career sense—rather, it’s in service of having more tools for this restless excavation of human senses, their origins and futures. If this seems high-minded, it’s because it is, but it’s also because Björk’s music now exists on ever grander musical staffs, her lingua franca is that which is rarely broached in casual conversation: How does it really feel to lose someone? How does it really feel to start loving again?"

He started by releasing Matmos-ian traditional Mexican cut-ups as Terrestre, and in 2002, he debuted with the album Martes under the name Murcof. Along the way he's remixed, cut vinyl as the mastering engineer for the Static Discos label, and scored the independent film Nicotina. He's a busy guy with a lot of talent, this Fernando Corona. Remember the name.With Martes, Corona took fragments of 20th Century classical by composers like Morton Feldman and Arvo Pärt and combined the tense arrangements with micro beats. It was an interesting record with an unusual sound, but it wasn't ultimately great; something about the loops and repetition of Martes didn't seem to gel. Corona's conception called for freedom and openness, music unconstrained by the snap-to grid. For that we would have to wait another 18 months.The 12-inch single ""Ulysses"", released earlier this year, delivered completely on Martes' promise and immediately built anticipation for the next Murcof full-length, due by the end of 2004. On both ""Ulysses"" and the B-side ""Urano"", Corona ditched samples to write and record his own charts, melding percolating minimalist beats with his subtly dissonant and open-ended phrases for strings. On this CD, Leaf has rewarded those without turntables by compiling the two tracks from the ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, two previously unreleased tracks, and seven remixes of material from Martes.Beyond the exceptional ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, both unheard tracks here are good but sound like holdovers from the Martes sessions. ""Una"" loops and chops a short section for strings and sets the melody against an undercurrent of catgut groans and plucks. It's like a duet between two instruments from the violin family-- one set to play ""music"" and the other focusing on ""sounds."" ""Ultimatum"", which foregrounds the drum programming and uses bits of piano and violin more as seasoning, is probably the funkiest track Corona has released as Murcof.The remixes are mostly strong, with the two best coming from familiar names. Jan Jelinek's ""Der Abschied von Dawson City Mix"" of ""Maiz"" is an excellent meeting of the minds that finds Jelinek using clipped fragments of plucked violin and double-bass slides for his own jazzed-up rhythmic ends. Deathprod's take on ""Ulysses"" leaves little of the original identifiably intact, but creates the kind of vast, doom-laden half-speed drift that will be instantly familiar to those familiar with his excellent Morals and Dogma.Colleen's mix of ""Muium"" is inspired and imaginative, as Cécile Schott burrows deep inside the original track, emerging with handfuls of individual notes that are stretched into drones and reassembled into weird melodies. On the beat-friendly tip, Sutekh's ""Triasgion mix"" of ""Memoria"" is highly danceable and driving techno infested with squirming samples pushing in several directions simultaneously, while fellow Nortec Collective member Fax (Ruben Tamayo, not Pete Namlook) offers a dubby and comparatively warm take on ""Maiz"".Fernando Corona's distinctive stamp is clearly affixed to every note of his originals, so his music lends itself to the remix treatment. But most exciting on Ulysses are the two new tracks that (hopefully) point the way toward the next Murcof album. What Corona brings to the table is something depressingly rare in electronic music: a fresh ear. Like Ekkehard Ehlers, Corona seems to hear music differently, allowing him to compose tracks that sound like no one else."

Fireworks flash while red hoods march through a field. At the center of the spectacle is a huge, pale, cartoonish rendering of Michael Jackson's head. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy's gargantuan ""All of the Lights"" soundtracks the procession, with Kanye pleading, ""Something wrong, I hold my head/ MJ gone, our nigga dead."" The tribute marks another chapter in West's ongoing obsession with the King of Pop.West's discography contains innumerable references and allusions to Jackson. His first hit as a producer, Jay-Z's ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"", sampled the Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"". For many, his first memorable lines as a rapper came during 2003's ""Slow Jamz"": ""She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson."" And when West's recent interview with Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show went awry, he took to Twitter, writing, ""I wish Michael Jackson had twitter!!!!!! Maybe Mike could have explained how the media tried to set him up!!! It's all a fucking set up!!!!"" Like most everything else, Kanye may exaggerate the kinship, but it's real. And it's never more apparent than on Twisted Fantasy, a blast of surreal pop excess that few artists are capable of creating, or even willing to attempt.To be clear, Kanye West is not Michael Jackson. As he told MTV last month, ""I do have a goal in this lifetime to be the greatest artist of all time, [but] that's very difficult being that I can't dance or sing."" He ended the thought with a laugh, but you get the impression he's not kidding. Unlike Michael, he's not interested in scrubbing away bits of himself-- his blackness, his candidness-- to appease the masses. And while Jackson's own twisted fantasies of paranoia and betrayal eventually consumed him whole, West is still aware of his illusions, though that mindfulness becomes increasingly unmoored with each newspaper-splashing controversy. The balance is tenuous, but right now it's working to his advantage. On Twisted Fantasy, Kanye is crazy enough to truly believe he's the greatest out there. And, about a decade into his career, the hardworking perfectionist has gained the talent on the mic and in the control room to make a startlingly strong case for just that.Kanye's last album, 2008's 808s and Heartbreak, was heavy on the Auto-Tune and stark synths, but relatively light on grandiose ideas. It was a necessary detour that expanded his emotional palette; a bloodletting after a harsh breakup and the passing of his mother that manifests itself in Twisted Fantasy's harshest lows. But musically, the new album largely continues where 2007's Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The College Dropout's comfort-food sampling and Late Registration's baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly. As a result, the record comes off like a culmination and an instant greatest hits, the ultimate realization of his strongest talents and divisive public persona. And since the nerd-superstar rap archetype he popularized has now become commonplace, he leaves it in the dust, taking his style and drama to previously uncharted locales, far away from typical civilization."

Cole is a student of hip-hop, the kind who moves to New York to stalk Jay-Z for an opportunity to rap for him, peppers his lyrics with nods to the greats, and pens an apology to Nas when his biggest single comes across as too poppy. Cole is aware of the structure and pace of good rap albums and anxious to apply them to his own music. For his third record, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, he channels the nostalgic self-mythology of Jay-Z’s Black Album. The cover is shot at his childhood home as Eminem did on the Marshall Mathers LP. The tracklist swaps s’s for z’s (“Wet Dreamz”, “A Tale of 2 Citiez”, “Love Yourz”) like 2pac’s All Eyez on Me. With 2014, Cole is certain he’s made his classic; he’ll tell you as much partway through the 15-minute credit roll “Note to Self”, which apes Kanye West’s joyous, candid College Dropout closer “Last Call”. Problem is, Cole hasn’t earned it yet.J. Cole is a workmanlike MC, a good-natured populist grappling with the ridiculousness of sudden celebrity. He makes passable albums with memorable singles. He’s great at synthesizing everyman relationship woes into terse pop nuggets. He works well with guests; his collaborations with Drake, Missy Elliott, and TLC are highlights in his growing body of work, and he gets along so well with Kendrick Lamar that the duo is rumored to have clandestinely recorded an EP together. In its quest to canonize Cole, 2014 Forest Hills Drive eschews both singles and guests. It’s a block of Cole raps and Cole hooks served mostly over Cole beats. Bold move, and where it floats, it soars, but it flops gloriously when it doesn’t.The laughable wordplay fails of mixtapes albums past (“My money like a senior, watch it graduate,” “Cole heating up like that leftover lasagna”) are thankfully absent, but Cole isn’t yet sharp enough of a storyteller to carry a full album on his own. “Wet Dreamz” recounts his first time having sex in lurid detail, from lying to a girl about his prowess to looking at porn for pointers to finding out the girl’s been lying, too. It’s relatable but hardly the kind of story you want to hear more than once. “No Role Modelz” parlays a suspicion about a hookup being a golddigger into a tirade about black women lacking respectable public figures, crudely suggesting that “she’s shallow but the pussy deep.” (For all the talk of Cole’s enlightenment he’s a perfect brute when it comes to women, and “No Role Modelz” is something of a tacit admission.) 2014 Forest Hills Drive often plays at a depth it never delivers."

It’s ambitious, impressive, and a bit unwieldy.","Kendrick Lamar is a giddy dramatist. He loves to pack his music with perspectives, personifying his many characters and muses with distinct voices, cadences, and beat switches that bring them to life. Those virtuosic tics have made him one of rap’s most celebrated storytellers and stylists; he is the first and only rapper to have won a Pulitzer Prize. For some, Kendrick’s elastic narration and indignant dispatches on Black life have made him a figure of supreme moral authority in hip-hop—a role he spurns on his fifth studio album. Kendrick spends Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers gleefully immolating his cherished reputation, swinging between caustic taunts and plaintive confessions over slick funk and soul production that gleams like shards of a mirror. The double album offers rap’s most jarring heel turn since Future cut loose on Monster, taking an unfocused but probing look at Kendrick’s most elusive character: himself.Five years have passed since Kendrick released the punchy and vivid DAMN. and curated the easygoing soundtrack for Black Panther—eons in the rap world, and quite a chunk of regular time too. Aside from the splashy launch of pgLang, his opaque media company with Dave Free, and a few scattered features, Kendrick has kept a low profile. His final album for his longtime label home Top Dawg Entertainment enters a world shaped by the pandemic, #MeToo, and the global protests against police brutality, events Kendrick comments on across the record while recounting how he’s spent his hiatus. His main priority, however, is clarifying who, exactly, Kendrick Lamar represents.The short answer is his family and his homies. The search for the longer answer propels the album. Prompted by narrator Whitney Alford, his romantic partner since high school, Kendrick opens the record by framing his honesty as dangerous, the first of many disclosures to come. “I been goin’ through somethin’/Be afraid,” he says, a warning that is followed by frantic double-time verses that slink around oblique piano stabs and brisk drums. His rapping jerks and lurches as he reveals he’s going to therapy and wracked by grief and shame, feelings that he copes with through luxury purchases and infidelity. Even as he details a specific fling, his storytelling frays, held together by the repetition of his paramour’s eye color rather than mise-en-scène or dense rhyme.Throughout Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, Kendrick seems to actively reject the elegance and structure of past songs like “DUCKWORTH.” and “good kid,” writing in quick strokes and sketches that channel his messy admissions. Ideas scamper around like field rabbits and he avoids clean hooks, denying the listener easy access to his thoughts. It verges on antipop. His flows streak across “Count Me Out,” bouncing off the kick drum, dancing with the chords. The “Kim”-inspired “We Cry Together” stages a noxious melodrama where Kendrick and Zola star Taylour Paige trade barbs that feel almost improvised despite being tightly rhymed and metered. Eminem can finally retire happy. His commitment to untidiness extends to the production, which is smooth but askew, rhythms and chords stacked precariously. Many of the songs, most of which have at minimum three producers, seem to split at the seams. On “Rich (Interlude),” Duval Timothy’s piano lines drift apart and glom back together, rain into vapor into clouds. On “Purple Hearts,” the drums fall away for the entirety of Ghostface’s stellar verse, strings and splashes of piano shadowing the rapper’s meter. The performances don’t always tap into the lushness of the production, but the beats and occasional R&B sample here and there give the often rambling verses some much-needed shape.Kendrick meanders to the album’s high points, stopping for strange and goofy hot takes on cancel culture, a neuron-melting non-issue that explains literally no rich and famous person’s actual life. His candor turns pugilistic on “N95” and “Worldwide Steppers,” tracks that find him praising Oprah’s moxie (“Say what I want about you niggas, I’m like Oprah, dawg”) and lamenting a time he paid for unhealthy catering. “I am not for the faint of heart,” he says after a preamble by Kodak Black, whose inclusion here and throughout the album brings to mind DaBaby and Marilyn Manson’s appearances on Donda. It's unclear whether his presence is meant to make a case for redemption or musical kinship."

There’s that coda to “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” (“You and I know we gotta die someday” sandwiched between one lyric about giving yourself to God and another pledging to “have fun every motherfucking night”); there’s the title track, which opens the album by signaling that the whole thing might be a fever dream, and ends with Lisa Coleman cooing, “Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?” It might have been tempting, in 1982, to see Prince’s experiments with synthesizers and programmed drums to be of a piece with these anxieties, emerging sounds turned against emerging fears. It might be tempting, now, to let those once cutting-edge technologies—which now read as obvious date markers—cast those same anxieties as relics of a far-off era.But those competing threads that Prince drew out so well—a smirking nihilism and a kind of empathy that posits lust and humanism as the same thing—have never disappeared from pop music, and his ability to marshal the Reagan years and the LM-1 for his own purposes, the way he had already done with the tropes of rock and funk, has rarely been replicated, before or after the Berlin Wall came down. And so 1999, which is now being reissued by Warner Records as part of a five-disc set that also includes B-sides, demos, unreleased songs, and concert footage, is the rare record that has come to define its era while also existing outside of it, a masterpiece that immediately precedes the albums Prince fashioned, conspicuously, as masterpieces.The album proper sounds, as it always has, like a computer breathing. (The songs have been remastered, and while they sound rich and clear on car speakers and in headphones, it feels beside the point to listen to “D.M.S.R.” out of anything but the nearly-blown monitors inside an overheated First Avenue.) Even a massive, mainstream hit like “Little Red Corvette”—the first Prince song that charted higher on Billboard’s pop chart than the R&B one—begins as if it’s climbing out of a digital muck. “Delirious” sounds like it comes from a very sexual lab experiment that went exactly according to plan. The music is unfailingly funky while still remarkably controlled, precise in the way that a purposefully askew movie prop is precise.And still, 1999 sprawls: ten of its 11 songs clock longer than five minutes, spiraling outward or, in the case of “Automatic,” locking into a long groove that asks, as we all have at one time or another, ‘What if the aliens fuck?’ It is exploratory without ever becoming impenetrable, “indulgent” but never boring. There is as always the tonal slipperiness that makes Prince’s music so rich to revisit: All the in-jokes and scathing subliminals of “All the Critics Love U In New York” come just two tracks after “Free,” which is marked by disarmingly sincere patriotism. Of course, there’s only one utterance of the word “sincere” on the album: “I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth.”"

The handful of young rappers with tread, most notably Chicago's Chief Keef or the recently returned-from-exile prince of Odd Future, Earl Sweatshirt, make music with pomp and bombast, as aggressive as it is catchy. But the kind of music Joey BadA$$ makes hasn't sounded contemporary since the mid-1990s, or around the time he was born.Today, Joey is the most visible member of a young artist collective called the Progressive Era (Pro Era for short), a crew mostly comprised of students from Brooklyn's Edward R. Murrow High School. These kids take musical inspiration from a time before any of them existed, specifically, the era referred to by hip-hop purists of a certain age as the ""Golden Age.""

The handful of young rappers with tread, most notably Chicago's Chief Keef or the recently returned-from-exile prince of Odd Future, Earl Sweatshirt, make music with pomp and bombast, as aggressive as it is catchy. But the kind of music Joey BadA$$ makes hasn't sounded contemporary since the mid-1990s, or around the time he was born.Today, Joey is the most visible member of a young artist collective called the Progressive Era (Pro Era for short), a crew mostly comprised of students from Brooklyn's Edward R.

The reasons it is difficult to listen to can overshadow the need to listen to it.","One of the most disruptive effects of streaming culture, especially as it pertains to rap, is the way it brings the periphery to the center: When one hot SoundCloud single does more for a young artist’s career overnight than years of label development, there are no rules beyond what works and what doesn’t. And so the fact that 2017’s most vital rap movement—a loosely-connected group making bruised, blown-out DIY music that often doesn’t sound much like rap at all, mostly discussed under the umbrella term of “SoundCloud rap”—has almost no mainstream appeal is not a hurdle, but a selling point. “Look At Me!”, the breakthrough hit from XXXTentacion, this scene’s most contentious poster boy, is a succinct embodiment of SoundCloud rap’s ideals. Purposely mixed like shit so you know it’s real, with crass lyrics that tumble over a decayed, bass-boosted Mala sample, the song was an inhospitable introduction to the underbelly of South Florida rappers that have so far dominated the sub-genre. Currently, it has more than 92 million SoundCloud streams; the first comment on the track reads, “MY EARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”But despite making a handful of the scene’s marquee hits, the 19-year old born Jahseh Onfroy stands apart from his SoundCloud rap peers. That distance was plainly illustrated in this year’s XXL Freshman cypher: while Playboi Carti, Ugly God, and Madeintyo bounce around, hyping one another with ad-libs and cooking dances, XXXTentacion lurks motionless in the background, head hung low. Then Sonny Digital cuts the beat, and X crouches to the floor, expressionless, rapping in a chilling monotone: “And if the world ever has an apocalypse, I will kill all of you fuckers.” There is a sense of unease when Digital brings the beat back; whatever just happened, no one is sure how to follow it.It’s a thing, these days, for rappers to insist that their work transcends genre—and hey, more power to ’em, though by now it’s a bit clichéd. But a deeper dive into X’s three-year catalog turns up sufficient proof that it is more than just lip service when he lists his inspirations as Nirvana, Papa Roach, and the Fray. Scattered throughout his SoundCloud are surprisingly compelling experiments in grunge, nu-metal, and post-Weeknd R&B. In fact, “Look At Me!” might be one of X’s least essential offerings—a solid introduction to his persona, but an insufficient distillation of his artistry. If anything, the song’s most revealing element is its title’s imperative exclamation point: “Look At Me!” is not a request, but a demand.It turns out people are looking, though perhaps not for the reasons X had hoped. As “Look At Me!” crept up the Hot 100 earlier this year, X sat in a Broward County jail, serving time for violating a house arrest agreement from 2015 charges of home invasion and battery with a firearm. But more recent, and far more harrowing, charges have made X notorious, raising the valid question of whether ethical consumption of his music is possible. Miami-Dade County court records reveal charges that include aggravated battery of a pregnant woman. That woman is alleged to be his ex-girlfriend; a photo of her swollen, bruised eyes has been circulated across social media. Google Trends data shows a grimly proportionate correlation between the alleged October 2016 incident and X’s sudden spike in visibility. Since then, there has been almost no middle ground in the response to the rapper’s popularity. X assumes a cult-leader authority over his die-hard battalion of stans, outlining in interviews a rubric for fandom that feels more like the Sea Org’s billion-year contract. Many of these fans seem eager to comply by trolling his critics (and, horrifyingly, his ex herself) with frenzied claims of “innocent until proven guilty” and familiar misinterpretations of the First Amendment. Meanwhile, just as many listeners have chosen to opt out entirely, and understandably so; it is soul-crushing enough to exist in 2017 without the obligation to engage with music made by even alleged abusers."

Even established rappers used the format to work out new ideas or to circumvent those labels entirely. As file sharing turned what was once a regional enterprise into a global one, rappers who would have previously given a song here and there to the DJs who issued compilation-style mixtapes began headlining their own. And so instead of cutting a hundred demos that might never be heard, or rapping a capella to starchy executives in boardrooms, many artists who broke during the W. Bush years did so by jacking industry beats and rapping underneath those DJs’ excited yelps, their formative work rewound and doubled back until it settled in your brain just so.When digital streaming platforms made it easy to profit off of online-only releases, provided the artist or label owns the rights to what’s uploaded, “mixtape” became a nominal term used cynically to signal which rap records were meant to be taken more seriously than others. (Think of how many times you’ve seen advertising for an artist’s “debut album” only to think, “Don’t they have three albums already?”) Call Me If You Get Lost—which is either Tyler, the Creator’s sixth or seventh album, depending on whether or not you count 2009’s Bastard—argues for the mixtape not as a tidy bit of careerist maneuvering, but as an aesthetic tradition. It’s an inspired choice, nostalgic but irreverent, and suited perfectly to his strengths: It grants him the freedom to play with tone, to write personally or use his gravelly voice as texture, to treat the harshest raps and the most delicate hooks as mad experiments gone wrong.Call Me is hosted by DJ Drama, the animated Philly native whose Gangsta Grillz series includes some of the most essential rap records of the century so far. There are times when the album evokes the grittiest of those tapes—its single reimagines a Gravediggaz song—but it breaks up the heavier cuts with shards of bright pop. (At times Call Me recalls In My Mind: The Prequel, the 2006 Gangsta Grillz tape by Tyler’s hero, Pharrell.) Drama is at his comedic best, goading on verses or underlining Tyler’s monologues about jet-setting (“A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream!”). He’s irresistible even when he’s fucking up the album’s title, as he does on the excellent “Hot Wind Blows,” which reunites him with Lil Wayne."

On Blue Slide Park, he was a childish ""frat rapper"" who made dumb jokes about smoking weed and referred to the vagina as a ""cooter."" On the claustrophobic Watching Movies With the Sound Off, he was rapping in a pitched-down voice alongside Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul about friends lost, drugs consumed, depression, and the trappings of success. And on the transparent, relaxed GO:OD AM, he sounds like someone’s troubled little brother made good: from the album’s opening horns, you can sense that this is a victory lap for Mac, a homecoming.From start to finish, this is his most refined and well put-together project. Getting through the 16 tracks on Blue Slide Park was like an endurance test, and even the deeper and much-improved Watching Movies started to sound interchangeable before it ended. The beats on GO:OD AM have a New York, boom-bap feel, with lots of jazz samples and harder drums, and it’s both more varied and more upbeat, from the trap-sounding beats of  ""When in Rome"" or the Chief Keef-featuring ""Cut the Check"" to love songs like ""ROS"" or the Miguel collaboration ""The Weekend"". Miller said he recorded 400 songs for Watching, and sometimes you couldn’t help but wonder about the selection process (""Objects in the Mirror""?) but on GO:OD AM, he’s learned to self-edit.Lyrically, Mac offers a music industry ""Scared Straight"". ""I’ve seen some motherfucking shit,"" he warns on ""Two Matches"". The interlude before ""God Speed"" includes a voicemail from his brother, checking in on him at a low point in his life, and later on in the song, he admits: ""White lines be numbing them dark times/ Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up/ Admit it’s a problem, I need a wake up/ Before one morning, I don’t wake up."" It’s funny to hear a 23-year-old who just kicked his habit and could be considered a kid himself refer regretfully to ""all the kids doing drugs"" on ""In the Bag"", but Mac has enough of his sense of humor intact to keep the album from playing like a D.A.R.E. campaign on wax.On ""God Speed"", the album’s standout track, he pays tribute to the close friends in his Most Dope Family, especially his right hand man Q, and it’s genuinely touching. ""Everybody saying I need rehab/ So I’m speeding with a blindfold on/ It won’t be long before they watching me crash/ And they don’t wanna see that,"" he raps, thanking the people that got him through the toughest time of his life. He’s never preachy, though: He sounds refreshed and rejuvenated, like someone who has been going for daily walks, eating veggies and drinking fruit smoothies every day.Many songs here reference his status as a white rapper, signaling his awareness of the rap game’s perception of him: ""I’m a white rapper/ They always call me shady,"" he says on ""Brand Name"", just a few minutes into the album. ""I know niggas think you white and you not about to go in with these bars,"" chimes in Domo Genesis on ""In the Bag"". There’s a kind of authenticity to him that has been there since the beginning, if you look for it: He doesn’t rap about breaking the law, because he’s not about that life. He’s a corny white rapper (meant as a compliment) who loves his family, friends, and hometown. We might not learn a lot of specifics about him, but there’s a lot of honesty in his music if you look for it."

He writes with grisly clarity and humor, and his songs here are sturdy, inventive, and sticky.","The jarringly sober track “a lot,” which opens 21 Savage’s poised and superbly focused i am > i was, is contemplative without being dramatic, mournful but not morose. At one point, the 26-year-old recounts his little brother’s murder and how it warped his psychology, but he does so in a perfunctory way, like talking to a therapist who’s already familiar with the smaller details. It’s a great tone to strike first: moody at a bit of a remove.Early in his career, the Atlanta rapper appeared almost exclusively as a mood—his voice was the ideally dry vehicle for 2016’s Savage Mode, Metro Boomin’s experiment in tempo and ambient sound. At times, 21’s appeal was explained away as a sort of authenticity fetishism, as if the raw carnage in the music was the main selling point. In truth, he’s spent the last few years building a persona that’s tormented by trauma and violence but unworried about projecting just how tough or wise or beloved or feared it’s made him. His raps are self-assured. The songs about the strip club—like the Three 6-sampling, Yung Miami-featuring “a&t”—are good because they’re good strip club songs not because they’re couched in self-awareness or PTSD.21 is an effective writer because he’s not hung up on what everything means—he’s much more interested in how things actually are, how they feel: the pit in his stomach when he thinks about jail, the weight of his jewelry in his hand. He’s tormented but also wants to go to the club, loves his mom but also his bodyguards, and is willing to explore those halves of himself without using “whoa, there are two halves of me” as a narrative crutch. So the statement in the title—I am greater than I was—is a little misleading. This is not a record about self-improvement as a 12-step course with dramatic results. When it’s about anything, it’s about self-improvement as a small, constant struggle where you contradict yourself and eat your own tail.The way 21 describes the grisliest details of his past can be unnerving when he filters it through an unexpected tone. He’ll rap about gruesome memories that are shocking in their neutrality: “Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on/Shit on my wrist? I woulda killed the whole house for.” 21 has burrowed so deep into his trauma-wracked brain (see “Close My Eyes” or “Numb” from 2017’s Issa Album) that the subtlest modulations on how he speaks about his demons can have a profound effect. On “asmr,” he raps, “All these dead bodies got me seein’ strange things” with a bounce in his voice that makes it seem like he’s about to introduce a new dance, and maybe he is."

Maybe it's because album sales don't really work as a precise measure of absolute popularity anymore. Maybe it's because 50's a shadow of his former self and no longer considered among the best, biggest, or most anything. Or maybe it's because Universal labelmates 50 and West seem more like they're doing this for us than for themselves. This is a prize fight between two heavyweight boxers moving in polar-opposite directions; the former weakly flailing through a creative crisis and a serious absence of hunger, the latter trying to transcend America by setting his sights on nothing less than the entire world.For all the pageantry, the most substantial takeaway from Kanye's new album is the realization that he might actually deserve the legendary status he constantly ascribes to himself. Though it doesn't quite match College Dropout or Late Registration in pleasure-center overload, West's third album in four years is both his most consistent and most enterprising yet. It also caps off an incredible (maybe even unprecedented) run: In terms of consistency, prolificness, and general all-around ability, it's hard to find anyone in mainstream rap who can touch what he's achieved within the same timeframe.Where College Dropout and Late Registration mostly functioned as contagious nostaglia trips, Graduation finds him settling into the pocket; instead of looking inside for answers, he's looking out to the world. When he raps ""I shop so much I can speak Italian"" on ""Champion"", it's obvious he's holding up worldliness as a point of pride. His production choices reinforce that belief: Here, Kanye splices his well-articulated production style with a brand new set of influences-- most of them European. What he ends up with is a record that splits the difference between two distinctive styles: his familiar strings and brass, helium vocal samples, and warm soul samples on one side; corroded rave stabs, vinegary synth patches, and weirdly modulated electronic noises on the other. (Ironically, the latter all have roots in West's hometown of Chicago.)While Graduation is far from the electro-house record some fans predicted when the Daft Punk-sampling ""Stronger"" first leaked, Kanye's interest in French house and rave extend beyond that one track. The stunning ""I Wonder"" combines a gentlemanly, piano-led sample (courtesy of 70s folk/jazz artist Labi Siffre) with a frizzy synth lead and alien-sounding keys, only to drown it all out with a massive swoop of strings; the weirdly dystopian club track ""Drunk and Hot Girls"" lurches along at a snail's pace, mixing Can's ""Sing Swan Song"" with a blend of gypsy music and detuned electronics for maximum queasiness; and the string-led ""Flashing Lights"" marries a Bond-worthy coda to staccato sounds and cut-up vocal samples. Where lesser producers have tried to bridge this gap only to wind up with beats that sound like bad mashups, West and co-producer DJ Toomp (T.I., ""What You Know"") make the juxapositions feel utterly natural. Combined with some other familiar source material (""Champion"", for example, nicks from Steely Dan), that undercurrent of experimentation puts Kanye's talents to good use."

It's a long player made for luxuriating and a total immersion into Drake's world-pop lifestyle.","Drake’s VIEWS was a commercial pinnacle and a creative and personal dead end. He scored the biggest hit of his career with “One Dance,” but the album surrounding it was so aggrieved and solipsistic you felt like you were insulting Drake by listening to it. His telepathic bond with producer Noah “40” Shebib had turned stale and over its punishing 80-plus minutes he wrung every last drop of sour grapes from his Beta-Male Conqueror persona. He had crushed his frenemies, seen them driven before him, and heard the lamentations of their women—or at least purposefully ignored their texts. What was next but exile?He seems to be tacitly admitting to this stagnation throughout the warm, pulsing, and generous More Life. His solution is a “Playlist” (not a big old serious Album, the implication goes, nor one of those little “mixtapes” other rappers bother with) that forces Drake out into the sunlight again, where he can once again mingle with the people. On More Life’s closing track “Do Not Disturb,” he acknowledges the bleak spot he was in: “I was an angry youth while I was writing VIEWS/Saw a side of myself that I just never knew.” He even lets his mother pipe in with a voice message two-thirds of the way through the record on “Can’t Have Everything” as she admonishes her son for the hostile, suspicious streak he was nurturing. “That attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you’re going to continue to feel alienated,” she advises.He doesn’t exactly drop the attitude, but he does play the background on More Life, implicitly acknowledging that he is often the least appealing element of his massively successful art. Dialing back on his self-pity allows all his skills that have kept him on top to float back to the surface: his ear for melodies, his sophisticated tastes, his curation skills. The more voices he lets into the frame, the fuller and richer the results, and More Life bursts with energy and lush sounds—more guests, more genres, more producers, more life. It is as confident, relaxed, and appealing as he’s sounded in a couple of years.Drake steps back and lets the dusky-voiced 19-year-old British singer Jorja Smith soar over a sinuous club track from the rising South African house producer Black Coffee on the gorgeous “Get It Together.” Black Coffee and Jorja comprise at least 80 percent of the song; Drake is mostly relegated to mumbling or doubling the hook. Sampha bleeds his gorgeous hurt over the entirety of “4422,” with no one else in sight, and Skepta claims an entire track, boasting that he “died and came back as Fela Kuti.” Young Thug steals not one but two songs, spitting a dense verse with no vocal filter on “Sacrifices” and yelping along with the roots-reggae horns of “Ice Melts.”"

Wide-ranging production makes it easy to ignore the rough spots.,"Joey Bada$$ was just 17 when he released his landmark 2012 mixtape 1999, and he was simultaneously looking to the past and the future. Hip-hop’s blog era had its fair share of revivalists, but this was a Brooklyn kid who worshipped at the altar of luminaries like Wu-Tang Clan and MF DOOM and opened his debut single “Waves” with an ode to one of his borough’s most celebrated rappers. There was an urgency to Joey’s words, rhyme schemes, and flows that split the difference between the fresh and the familiar. When he raps about wanting to meet JAY-Z, buy his mother a Range Rover, and take over the world over a swelling Freddie Joachim sample, you believe him. He was taking a similar stance to Nas on his 1994 debut Illmatic: an old soul with a young face, unstuck in time like a multiversal traveler.By honing the vintage aesthetic and skill, Joey and the Pro Era collective granted their movement some edge, the kind that leads the children of former presidents to rock your gear. But as his ambition and profile began to grow, he often struggled to reconcile his love for the golden era with distinctive, modern sounds. All-Amerikkkan Bada$$, his 2017 album, mixed lush live-band production and political consciousness with roughneck flows and the bland platitudes of his platinum-certified single “Devastated”—a pleasant but messy shot at being all things to all people. Joey’s been in the spotlight long enough to see the old-school ethos he made his name on experience a revival in both the underground and mainstream and even star in an Oscar-winning short film. But though his rap fundamentals are as solid as ever, that middle ground has become a niche, breeding enjoyable but unchallenging music.To its credit, 2000, his third studio album and first in five years, tries to move past those growing pains. On intro “The Baddest,” Joey looks back on his first decade in music, placing himself among the likes of Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole with an unfazed chill, amplified by the lush piano interpolation of DeBarge’s “I Like It”: “You niggas thought I was finished? I’m offended/I’m just getting replenished/MCs gettin’ diminished when I’m in attendance.” You’ve heard Joey rap like this before, but the scope is plusher, a Bad Boy veneer slathered over corner-bred rhyme schemes. “Baddest” sets the stage for 2000 which, as a whole, blends in with the posh New York rap zeitgeist. He’s jogging in place in the flashiest tracksuit he could find."

Maybe it's because album sales don't really work as a precise measure of absolute popularity anymore. Maybe it's because 50's a shadow of his former self and no longer considered among the best, biggest, or most anything. Or maybe it's because Universal labelmates 50 and West seem more like they're doing this for us than for themselves. This is a prize fight between two heavyweight boxers moving in polar-opposite directions; the former weakly flailing through a creative crisis and a serious absence of hunger, the latter trying to transcend America by setting his sights on nothing less than the entire world.For all the pageantry, the most substantial takeaway from Kanye's new album is the realization that he might actually deserve the legendary status he constantly ascribes to himself. Though it doesn't quite match College Dropout or Late Registration in pleasure-center overload, West's third album in four years is both his most consistent and most enterprising yet. It also caps off an incredible (maybe even unprecedented) run: In terms of consistency, prolificness, and general all-around ability, it's hard to find anyone in mainstream rap who can touch what he's achieved within the same timeframe.Where College Dropout and Late Registration mostly functioned as contagious nostaglia trips, Graduation finds him settling into the pocket; instead of looking inside for answers, he's looking out to the world. When he raps ""I shop so much I can speak Italian"" on ""Champion"", it's obvious he's holding up worldliness as a point of pride. His production choices reinforce that belief: Here, Kanye splices his well-articulated production style with a brand new set of influences-- most of them European. What he ends up with is a record that splits the difference between two distinctive styles: his familiar strings and brass, helium vocal samples, and warm soul samples on one side; corroded rave stabs, vinegary synth patches, and weirdly modulated electronic noises on the other. (Ironically, the latter all have roots in West's hometown of Chicago.)While Graduation is far from the electro-house record some fans predicted when the Daft Punk-sampling ""Stronger"" first leaked, Kanye's interest in French house and rave extend beyond that one track. The stunning ""I Wonder"" combines a gentlemanly, piano-led sample (courtesy of 70s folk/jazz artist Labi Siffre) with a frizzy synth lead and alien-sounding keys, only to drown it all out with a massive swoop of strings; the weirdly dystopian club track ""Drunk and Hot Girls"" lurches along at a snail's pace, mixing Can's ""Sing Swan Song"" with a blend of gypsy music and detuned electronics for maximum queasiness; and the string-led ""Flashing Lights"" marries a Bond-worthy coda to staccato sounds and cut-up vocal samples. Where lesser producers have tried to bridge this gap only to wind up with beats that sound like bad mashups, West and co-producer DJ Toomp (T.I., ""What You Know"") make the juxapositions feel utterly natural. Combined with some other familiar source material (""Champion"", for example, nicks from Steely Dan), that undercurrent of experimentation puts Kanye's talents to good use."

Like The Weeknd, who produced sporadic sessions as the Noise before a name change and a dollop of mystery sent his career into the stratosphere, and Frank Ocean, who toiled in obscurity as Def Jam songwriter Lonny Breaux prior to 2011’s Nostalgia, Ultra, PARTYNEXTDOOR had been making cheery EDM-infused R&B under his real name Jahron Brathwaite before starting with a clean slate. Brathwaite’s OVO acquisition was announced with an unassuming track drop on Drake’s October’s Very Own blog. The song, “Make a Mil”, found PARTYNEXTDOOR running through fleet verses of self-assured melodic rap with greater ease and range as a singer than his benefactor. His eponymous self-titled mixtape trades the doe-eyed sensitivity of the Jahron B. material for something closer in spirit to the villainous player chronicles of Ty Dolla $ign and the Weeknd.The album’s chock full of strippers and drugs, and our narrator navigates a succession of dimly lit clubs and private afterparties with devilish gusto, informing the exotic dancing love interest of “Relax with Me” that, “Girl yo ass is so instrumental” and noting elsewhere that “Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign”. All of this is carried out in a vocal delivery that fuses an R&B singer’s melodic finesse with the percussive wordplay of a rapper. In his lower register he’s a dead ringer for his boss; “Wus Good/Curious” invokes So Far Gone makeout cuts like “Houstatlantavegas”. When he draws his voice up into a high register word flurry on “Right Now” he essentially affects Meek Mill’s puppy dog yawp. If you close your eyes you might mistake “Tbh” and its oscillation between Brathwaite’s baritone and high tenor ranges for a lost Drake/Weeknd collaboration. Brathwaite’s a talented singer, but sometimes you get the impression he’s better at twisting and recapitulating sounds than inventing them. The inarguable triumph of PARTYNEXTDOOR is actually his production.PARTYNEXTDOOR abounds with homespun beats that turn radio rap tropes inside out. “Make a Mil” and closer “Ballin’” both call in the foreboding 808s and the cricket chirp hi-hats of trap, but the former does it in service to a central melody played on what sounds like a Pan flute while the latter undercuts its cavernous low end with breathy flute notes that soak up all the menace. Mid-album highlight “Right Now” revolves around a breakneck synth figure, while “Break from Toronto” bastes otherwise unremarkable drum programming in a choice chop of Miguel’s “Girl with the Tattoo”. Throughout the album PARTYNEXTDOOR’s flair for off-the-wall musical flourishes (the clinking glasses and noirish sax on “Wild Bitches”, the drillbit synth sound that piledrives the kick hits home on “Wus Good/Curious”, the brashly synthetic horn section on the chorus of “Make a Mil”) and propensity to stash melodic elements in unexpected corners (see: the marimba melody of “Over Here” and the album’s tendency to pair hollow kick thuds with deep bass hits to give the effect of trunk-rattling drums) collude to buoy these songs through fitful moments of mimicry.Jahron Brathwaite’s decision to ditch the mealy mouthed, saccharine dance pop to transmogrify into PARTYNEXTDOOR has been a shot in the arm. He’s got the ear of Drake at a time when the Toronto MC’s presence has solidified into dominance, and his versatility as a producer and songwriter means he could be put to great use in the OVO pop machine. PARTYNEXTDOOR occasionally works better as an audition for future work with Drake than an expression of Brathwaite’s own aspirations as an artist. But it’s also clear from the bedroom intimacy of the production and the demo-like quality of some of the one- and two-minute sketches that pepper the album between the more fully realized songs that PARTYNEXTDOOR is maybe just a sampler. It spends much of its brief running time wandering around Take Care’s wheelhouse churning out deft approximations of Drake and Noah “40” Shebib’s pet sounds, but some of it is used to strip their signature brand of confessional hip-hop/R&B fusion for parts to restructure it into something new."

It’s a precious origin story, the stuff of rock docs and hood DVDs, and it’s delivered with such precision, vivid detail, and masterful pacing that it can’t possibly be true. But it’s a tale too strange to be fiction, and too powerful not to believe in—just like its author. Kendrick Lamar has proven he’s a master storyteller, but he’s been saving his best plot twist this whole time, waiting until he was ready, or able, to pull it off.Storytelling has been Lamar’s greatest skill and most primary mission, to put into (lots of) words what it's like to grow up as he did—to articulate, in human terms, the intimate specifics of daily self-defense from your surroundings. Somehow, he’s gotten better. The raps on his fourth studio album DAMN. jab mercilessly like a sewing machine. His boyish nasal instrument is distinct and inimitable as it slithers up and down in pitch on “PRIDE.” Even when Lamar sounds like Eminem, or Drake, or OutKast, he sounds like himself, and he arguably outpaces them all as a writer. On “FEAR.,” he relays daily threats from his mom (“I’ll beat your ass, keep talking back/I’ll beat your ass, who bought you that? You stole it”) and from his neighbors (“I’ll probably die because I ain’t know Demarcus was snitching/I’ll probably die at these house parties fucking with bitches”) over low-slung blues stirred by The Alchemist. Lamar’s recitation is so effortless you wonder where he breathes, or if he does at all.Kendrick is a relic of the mid-aughts rap blog era, where bedroom WordPress pages would post .zips of albums by amateurs. After years of such releases, Kendrick dropped a self-titled EP in 2009 that featured Big Pooh from Little Brother and elicited such Nah Right comments as “I like the beats on this” and “who da fuk?” Accolades swelled with each project; by 2011, he was considering signing with Dr. Dre; by 2013, he was playing “SNL” and touring with Kanye West. He came of age with his fans, and by 2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly, he put to music their chest-clenched frustrations. Ever the curtain-puller, he released an album of untitled and unmastered drafts and grew his hair out. His short absence, even after lending Taylor Swift a verse, has been made to feel longer by his media shyness and a surging tide of new rappers shuttled out daily."

He was furious when rap blogs refused to post Odd Future songs. He has gleefully responded to being banned from countries. His songs attempted to reconcile with a divided fanbase. The subtext of Odd Future was that pearl-clutching moralists simply weren’t in on the (obscene) joke—the whole point of being radicals is to be “apart from.” He has also done his fair share of exclusion, too: marginalizing and upsetting women and queer people with violently misogynistic and homophobic lyrics. It has been asked how to reconcile the genius with the foul-mouthed punk.Flower Boy (promoted as Scum Fuck Flower Boy) is Tyler’s course-correction, surprisingly meditative and beautifully colored, a collage of memories and daydreams that trades bratty subversion for reflection and self-improvement. He probes the things that shaped his psyche—loneliness, isolation, and disorientation—and focuses on outgrowing friendships, balancing the pull of nostalgia and the necessity for growth. Not only is Flower Boy Tyler’s most trenchant work, it’s his most inclusive: “Find Your Wings”: The Album, gentle and liberating. “Tell these black kids they can be who they are,” he raps on “Where This Flower Blooms,” as he grows into the artist he’s always longed to be, and perhaps always was.While trying to recreate an N.E.R.D. album, Cherry Bomb more or less imploded. But it didn't completely shed Tyler’s old skin, enlisting a host of colorful collaborators (Roy Ayers, Leon Ware, Charlie Wilson, Chaz Bundick, and Dâm-Funk) for songs about jerking off and underage relationships. His raps were regularly empty games of juvenile one-upmanship, snooty hand-wringing aimed at homebodies and the working class, and vitriolic rant raps aimed at no one in particular. There were love songs, but they were immature and sometimes flat-out creepy. Time had rendered his shock raps pretty toothless, and it was all sloppy. Conversely, Flower Boy is transformational, lovestruck and penetrating. Finally, Tyler gets to the essence of ideas he’s been chiseling at all along: the angst of a missed connection, the pain of unrequited love, navigating youthful ennui. These are hopeful and sincere songs about finding yourself and trying to find someone who values you completely.Tyler spends much of Flower Boy chasing his “‘95 Leo,” coming out in the process. On “Foreword,” he raps, “Shoutout to the girls that I lead on/For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm/And trying they hardest to keep my head on straight/And keeping me up enough till I had thought I was airborne.” He later writes, “Next line will have ‘em like ‘Whoa’: I’ve been kissing white boys since 2004.” The album’s literal and figurative centerpiece is “Garden Shed,” an inward-looking sexual awakening turning an extended metaphor into a watershed moment. Flower Boy unfurls from this revelation and the subsequent romance. He pens songs for his lover (“See You Again”), leaves him voicemails (“Glitter”), and seeks comfort through contact."

Cole’s fourth album, he wrestles with the fragility of life and the importance of family ties.  He also sands down some of his worst impulses.","Some time this March, a SWAT team descended on a home in a wooded, well-to-do North Carolina suburb. According to the producer Elite, helicopters vultured overhead as armed officers broke down the front door and raided the house, presumably acting on a tip from a neighbor who believed the occupants were manufacturing or selling drugs. There was no one home; masked and bulletproof-vested men kept pouring inside. Instead of a grow-op, officers found a basement littered with recording equipment, the bones of a creative hideout that had filled the community with little more than some errant blunt smoke.The house was J. Cole’s. It wasn’t the native North Carolinian’s only property holding: he’d previously purchased his childhood home, at 2014 Forest Hills Drive in Fayetteville, with plans to turn it into a rent-free safe haven for single mothers. On his last solo effort—which was named after the Fayetteville house—he rapped about his adolescent fantasies of white picket fences surrounded by trees, by quiet. The SWAT experience, recounted on “Neighbors,” the best song from Cole’s fourth album, 4 Your Eyez Only, is a grim perversion of those dreams, and it anchors a record that wrestles with the fragility of life and the importance of family ties.For long stretches, Eyez is a rumination on death. Cole frequently invokes other points of view, including that of his late friend James McMillan, Jr., who was killed at 22. The album is peppered with references to his murder, and a testimony from a young girl in Fayetteville, which appears at two points on “Ville Mentality,” echoes the reality faced by McMillan’s own daughter. Cole is himself a new father (“She’s Mine, Pt. 2” is about his wife and newborn child), and the title track, which closes the album with a missive for those young girls, is anchored by his personal anxieties, making for some of Cole’s most affecting writing to date.He also comes to life on “Immortal,” which sounds as if someone played Cole an unheard 2Pac song from the Makaveli sessions and then dared him to recreate it from memory. The song’s narrator feeds baggies through a burglar bar, watches Bic lighters wave under spoons, wakes up early to hit the Bowflex. It’s details like that last one that set “Immortal” apart from so much of Cole’s early work: you can see the speaker bathed in the artificial light of 3 a.m. infomercials, figuring he needs to put some weight on. He equivocates—“crime pays like a part-time job” is the sort of evocative, economical phrase that has eluded Cole so often in the past. And when he rattles off rhetorical questions (“Have you ever seen a nigga that was Black on the moon?/Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?/Have you ever seen a motherfucking ribbon in the sky?”) he’s working in a long tradition of rappers and writers knocking a grave present against against its opposite. To that end, at the song’s most defiant moment, Cole nods to his real life: “If they want a nigga, they gon’ have to send a SWAT team.”"

What was next but exile?He seems to be tacitly admitting to this stagnation throughout the warm, pulsing, and generous More Life. His solution is a “Playlist” (not a big old serious Album, the implication goes, nor one of those little “mixtapes” other rappers bother with) that forces Drake out into the sunlight again, where he can once again mingle with the people. On More Life’s closing track “Do Not Disturb,” he acknowledges the bleak spot he was in: “I was an angry youth while I was writing VIEWS/Saw a side of myself that I just never knew.” He even lets his mother pipe in with a voice message two-thirds of the way through the record on “Can’t Have Everything” as she admonishes her son for the hostile, suspicious streak he was nurturing. “That attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you’re going to continue to feel alienated,” she advises.He doesn’t exactly drop the attitude, but he does play the background on More Life, implicitly acknowledging that he is often the least appealing element of his massively successful art. Dialing back on his self-pity allows all his skills that have kept him on top to float back to the surface: his ear for melodies, his sophisticated tastes, his curation skills. The more voices he lets into the frame, the fuller and richer the results, and More Life bursts with energy and lush sounds—more guests, more genres, more producers, more life. It is as confident, relaxed, and appealing as he’s sounded in a couple of years.Drake steps back and lets the dusky-voiced 19-year-old British singer Jorja Smith soar over a sinuous club track from the rising South African house producer Black Coffee on the gorgeous “Get It Together.” Black Coffee and Jorja comprise at least 80 percent of the song; Drake is mostly relegated to mumbling or doubling the hook. Sampha bleeds his gorgeous hurt over the entirety of “4422,” with no one else in sight, and Skepta claims an entire track, boasting that he “died and came back as Fela Kuti.” Young Thug steals not one but two songs, spitting a dense verse with no vocal filter on “Sacrifices” and yelping along with the roots-reggae horns of “Ice Melts.”"

A significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor.","The Albatross became a self-fulfilling prophecy for Foxing. While the St. Louis band's relentless touring enabled the slow-build success of their debut, the aching opening track on Dealer recounts the effect of Conor Murphy having to repeat ugly truths about himself night after night for the better part of two years: ""I am caught up in the guilt/ Making a living off of drowning."" Though Dealer is an artistic triumph and a significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor. And that's why, from its very first second, Murphy sounds drained over the prospect of doing it all over again—Dealer is not an easy listen. It sounds like it was very difficult to make, and reliving it is going to be even harder.It's in Foxing's nature to welcome a challenge. Of all the leading figures in the Fest-centered post-emo world, they made the most demanding, unique and self-assured debut. It certainly earned the genre tag—silvery guitar figures streaked and twinkled like tiny Explosions in the Sky, while Murphy's keening vocals delivered confrontational and caustic lyrics with spasmodic, burst-and-bloom dynamics. To paraphrase the slow-motion self-evisceration of ""Rory"" (think the Wrens' ""This Is Not What You Had Planned"" stretched to four minutes), he ripped his heart out while it was still beating and shoved it directly in your face. But Foxing are more interested in a renaissance than a ""revival"", and they mirror the adaptive and forward-thinking qualities of their scene, creating a new voice for familiar sentiments: There was certainly hints of Cap'n Jazz on Albatross, but also actual jazz, as well as Sufjan Stevens' baroque Americana and touches of avant-garde R&B.The Albatross darted fitfully and stretched out in all directions, while Dealer pulls all of Foxing's influences inward. Inverting his typical role of making burly post-rock bands sound delicate, producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Caspian) boosts Foxing's fragility—Dealer is constructed like an expensive timepiece where you can see every exacting movement behind a thick, glossy lacquer. Murphy's much-improved vocals negotiate the curvature of ""Weave""'s mournful melody and the band's syncopated sway—imagine what the Chicago late-'90s post-rock scene could've accomplished if they hooked up with the guys downstate in Urbana-Champaign. While there were short instrumental interludes on The Albatross, ""Winding Cloth"" is a full-on string orchestration, offering four minutes to absorb the shellshocked war reportage of ""Indica"" before segueing into the heavy-hearted poetry of ""Redwoods""."

Throughout 2012’s Sports and 2014's You’re Gonna Miss It All, Jake Ewald and Brendan Lukens sang mostly about girls, social insecurity, and punk rock hypocrisy—nothing that the average person in their audience hadn’t experienced themselves.Since then, Modern Baseball have unexpectedly evolved into an *important band. After canceling an Australian tour last fall, Lukens went to rehab and was diagnosed with manic depression, alcoholism, marijuana addiction, and cutting behavior, all of which was unsparingly detailed in their Tripping in the Dark *mini-doc. Every Modern Baseball interview in the time since has doubled as advocacy for destigmatizing mental illness and encouraging the seeking of medical treatment. They’re not alone: Along with Sorority Noise, the Word Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, the Hotelier and basically any leader of emo’s 4th-wave, Modern Baseball demonstrate an undeniable sonic ambition and social conscience in a genre still reduced to a “Sad as Fuck” T-shirt. Their extracurricular candor is a necessary complement to Holy Ghost, which asks for difficult things out of its audience—space, patience and acceptance.In the past, MoBo’s appeal often lied in how they looked like guys who came to their shows straight from a Drexel lecture hall, singing about things that happened to them just that day. On Holy Ghost, Ewald and Lukens admit that even a wholly unpretentious, image-free band like Modern Baseball might have to put on an act sometimes just to make it to the next gig. “The glare from our stupid, spineless words just whining, every fucking day/what do I really want to say?,” Ewald spews on “Note to Self,” one of the many road-weary tracks here.  Throughout Holy Ghost, Lukens and Ewald mostly want to say “I miss you,” “I love you,” or, “I’m sorry.” But with their friends, family and Philly often hundreds of miles away, Modern Baseball either internalize or end up directing their anxieties at each other.There was a point where it was unclear whether Modern Baseball would make it to Holy Ghost,* and the tension is audaciously presented in a Speakerboxxx/The Love Below-style split condensed into less than a half hour. Ewald is given the first six tracks, while the remaining five are Lukens’. Even up to last year’s excellent MOBO Presents: The Perfect Cast EP featuring Modern Baseball, *new listeners could be forgiven thinking the band only had one singer. At this point, Ewald and Lukens seem like total inverses of each other."

On “Olorun,” the meditative opener to his second album, Work of Art, he extols the Supreme Being of the Yoruba religion before praising himself. “I’m a brand new man,” he proclaims. Ahmed Ololade’s first love was dancing, but as much as he loved feeling the music, he knew the best way to make money was to become a consummate artist. He took up singing and adopted a stage name, and after a steady stream of singles he released his first full-length, Mr. Money With the Vibe, in 2022. It became Billboard’s highest-charting debut album from a Nigerian artist. He was, undoubtedly, a star.Asake’s first album was the culmination of ideas percolating throughout his home country. Most notably, it was amapiano—a strain of South African house music in the lineage of kwaito—that brought Asake’s Afrofusion music to another level. This regional style was already spreading across the continent—in Tanzania and Kenya, Namibia and Mozambique—and fellow Nigerians like Davido and Mayorkun were collaborating with South Africans to meld it with Afrobeats. What separated Asake from his peers was how he forged a sound all his own: He incorporated choral harmonies and string arrangements, and worked in elements of the Indigenous Yoruba music known as fújì. The opening track on his debut announced this audacious blend: “Dull” interpolated “Oke Agba” from the pioneering fújì musician Ayinde Barrister.With Work of Art, Asake understands that his winning formula needs no adjustments. Wistful strings inject solemnity on “What’s Up My G,” and as the characteristic log-drum loop of amapiano establishes a lithe beat, he expertly switches between vocal rhythms and inflections. There are many shades to his wealth, his nimble delivery implies. And when he lists off designer brands and luxury cars, the host of voices behind him frame his braggadocio as a spiritual act. “If you don’t feel blessed, you won’t be blessed,” he recently told ABC News. It sounds like the flipside to a Yoruba òwe, or proverb: “Ẹní lówó kó ṣe bí ọba” (“Whoever has riches should act like a king”).These two pithy statements reflect Asake’s own mindset of manifestation: His songs often read as a proposition that anyone who hustles can experience the blessings he’s had. On “Basquiat,” he makes sure to let you know that the “work of art” his album title refers to is, indeed, himself. Still, the song’s group chants remind you that celebration can and should be a communal act. Perhaps that’s why he’s so drawn to amapiano, a style of music that South African artist Thandiswa Mazwai has said reflects “how radical Black joy can be.” Inevitably, some of the most irresistible songs on Work of Art are cheery. “Sunshine” is an encouraging balm, its bubbly synths and rising vocal harmonies capturing the warmth of time spent with loved ones. “Awodi” is less summery but just as hopeful. Asake sings about rising from the slums, and his slow, patient delivery feels like he’s extending an arm to lift you up beside him.Stories of rebirth are nothing new, but Asake’s feel revelatory because they’re in constant search of innovation. “Amapiano” sheds some light on his approach. If the amapiano coming from South Africa is more tied to the country’s dance lineage, then Asake is intent on using it in bite-sized pop song form, as an avenue for intimate storytelling. But this isn’t to say that the production doesn’t stand out: “Great Guy” turns amapiano’s flagellating bass synths into pure, rumbling texture, while “2:30” lets them resonate in a way that recalls fújì’s talking drums. Closer “Yoga” even turns traditional séga—music that originated from enslaved Africans in Réunion and Mauritius—into a contemporary plea for peace. Asake grew up listening to Nigerian artists who continually evolved the country’s music, like Fela Kuti, Ayinla Omowura, and Wande Coal. His cross-generational, intercontinental music is doing the same."

The sound is like a gauze bandage covering emotional wounds, but Scott lets the red bleed through nonetheless.","Questioning what you once held fundamentally true is exhausting, but in every possible way, Brooklyn-via-Nashville singer-songwriter Mackenzie Scott's intense, spiritual sophomore album as Torres suggests that this is work worth doing. Her 2013 self-titled debut felt inherently raw in its stripped-down folk-rock, a sound akin to that of her future collaborator Sharon Van Etten. On Sprinter, however, Scott shrouds her voice with feedback and heavier rock instrumentation, created alongside PJ Harvey producer and percussionist Rob Ellis. The sound is like a gauze bandage covering the emotional wounds, the profound isolation and fear of abandonment, that sit at the heart of Sprinter. But Scott lets a little red bleed through nonetheless, and for listeners, at least, that's a good thing.An album ago, Scott told what was presumed to be some version of her own adoption story with ""Moon & Back""; the song is written from the perspective of a woman who left a letter for the baby she gave up, but no names are given. Though Torres continues to write from perspectives besides her own—and it continues to prove interesting—on Sprinter, any trepidation she may have felt over first-person narrative is pushed aside in pursuit of unflinching honesty. On the album's stunning, solo acoustic closer ""The Exchange"", Scott is direct where before she was mysterious: ""Mother, father, I'm underwater, and I don't think you can pull me out of this,"" she coos in the chorus. ""Blew my per diem on an eighth of Blue Dream/ So I can breathe but I still can't breathe,"" Scott adds, revealing her coping method of choice—sativa-dominant hybrids. The song's arresting plainspokenness recalls Neko Case's memorable a cappella declaration of abandonment and rejection on The Worst Things Get, the Harder I Fight...'s ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"".Sprinter splits its mood between depression and rage, mirrored in the album's loud-quiet musical dichotomy that is not unlike that of early PJ Harvey albums. With the aid of her co-producer Ellis (showing off his status as an underrated rock drummer who makes every beat sound crisp), Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley (who recently helped Perfume Genius also reach a musical state as real as it is deeply unsettling), and Harvey bassist Ian Oliver, Scott fully inhabits her loudest moments by inching towards post-rock and synth-rock. The album's crowning achievement, ""Son, You Are No Island"", forges a mystical through line from Celtic music to Hole's ""I Think That I Would Die"", to Godspeed You! Black Emperor, to Mica Levi's Under the Skin soundtrack. This song simmers with rage, a stick of dynamite waiting to blow, but it's Scott's restraint in delaying the explosions—first a wall of hardened distortion, then via vocal loops—that hits the hardest."

Four years ago, Drake’s “One Dance” introduced the Nigerian pop star internationally, broadening his audience and spotlighting a genre on the verge of becoming a global powerhouse. The 30-year-old singer has picked up the skills to dualize his music, making art with one foot planted firmly at home while the other seeks success in new markets. From making dance records designed to conquer Lagos, he’s expanded into other territories, by leaning heavily on Caribbean influences. It hasn’t been an easy task, and in the time since WizKid gained international recognition, his crossover credentials have been in question back in Africa.His stateside debut, Sounds From the Other Side, struggled to make a dent commercially. His contract with Sony demands that he continues to play for a global audience, making music that would not work connect locally back home. To work around contractual restrictions, he’s paired with producers and DJs, appearing on their records as an invested guest, to start records in the Nigerian market. More complex still is the ever-changing scene in Lagos, where a new guard of musicians including Omah Lay, Fireboy, and Joeboy are expanding the borders of genre and redefining the local sound. WizKid’s legacy is secure, but in 2020, he’s a king under threat of deposition.Made in Lagos dispels those doubts over 14 tracks. Here, he’s finally balanced the formula to unite home and abroad with big pop songs that can compete across cultures and an underlying theme that embraces his roots. The project is dedicated to Lagos, Nigeria’s bubbling creative hub, historically the beating heart of Africa’s art community. It’s home for WizKid, the place where he was born, raised, and first accepted. It isn’t his first love letter to his hometown: His previous ode to the city’s popular Ojuelegba neighborhood brought Drake into his life and launched his crossover campaign. He continues to embrace his people in art and in action: As young Nigerians around the world participated in the recent #EndSARS protests against police brutality, WizKid delayed his album release and joined in, marching alongside fans in London and becoming a vocal advocate on social media.Made in Lagos is narrow in its sonic approach, but for good reason. Where previous projects were outsized cocktails of club bangers and experimental pursuits, WizKid’s measured take on his fourth album betrays refined maturity. His sounds are familiar, his delivery sure. And the sincerity bleeds through the songwriting. “Inna inna inna, I know say dey go pray on my downfall/I’m still a winner winner,” he asserts early on, as horns travel through the winding melodies of “Reckless.” Wizkid’s delivery of patois and pidgin English interpolating with lush saxophone instantly set this apart. He has refined his approach, finding comfort in exploring the intersection of two sound cultures: Lagos exuberance meets Jamaican rhythms."

The young wordsmith, also known as Santan Dave, would stare into the camera and relay fierce reflections about his tumultuous life, using them as a lyrical crowbar to pry open the doors keeping voiceless Londoners in the dark. On “Thiago Silva” he proved he could hold his own at a grime tempo, and fans soon discovered he played the piano, too. It was difficult to fathom that he was only a teenager. Now Dave is 20, and his debut album, Psychodrama, is one of the most significant bodies of British rap music in a generation.Psychodrama is a form of psychotherapy in which patients role-play events from their past to heal and make sense of themselves. Dave uses the term as a cathartic glue to bind heavy themes together, bringing listeners into his therapy room while he grapples with societal injustice, industry contradictions, and private pain. The album starts and finishes with songs “Psycho” and “Drama,” respectively, and the latter includes a touching dialogue with his older brother, who is serving a life sentence in prison. This haunting backdrop has long bled into Dave’s lyricism—“Never had a father and I needed you to be the figure,” he cries in the album’s closing passage—but its impact is more closely examined across Psychodrama than ever before. Over 11 songs and much hypnotic piano playing, Dave sets his conceptual limits, and then fills them with an urban opera that blends his desire to exorcize demons with old-soul musical wisdom and youthful performativity.When the single “Black” was debuted on BBC Radio 1 as Annie Mac’s Hottest Record in the World, it garnered backlash from listeners who missed its nuanced critique of language as a limiting construct on racial identity, expression, and diversity. But the song—on which Dave shares his piano bench with acclaimed producer Fraser T. Smith, whose influence can be heard throughout the album—is not just a proud race anthem. As political and media establishments in Britain continue to fall short in representing ethnic minority experiences (in one recent case, a centrist politician found herself unable to avoid even a basic faux pas), “Black” doubles as a manifesto for responsible phraseology, and against anachronistic stereotyping. “A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/And if he’s white, you give him a chance, he’s ill and confused/If he’s black he’s probably armed, you see him and shoot,” Dave assesses."

Over the course of his immortal four-project run in the mid-2010s—Monster, Beast Mode, 56 Nights, and Dirty Sprite 2—the word became the defining trait of his persona. As he emerged as one of rap’s biggest superstars, it was like his conscience was telling him one thing and his masculinity another. But “toxic” also flattened the emotional complexity and thoughtfulness of Future’s songwriting. He wrote brooding sagas about self-inflicted heartbreak; candid reflections on the drugs that he blamed for his pain and relied on to heal it, too; turn-up joints about a life of luxury layered with the sense that he was overcompensating for lost love. Often on these tapes, he could go through all those feelings in one verse, blurring reality and myth.But since then, despite some great moments—specifically 2017’s HNDRXX—Future has increasingly become a caricature of himself. His writing started to feel one-dimensional, embellishing the Future persona with even more devious lines. His stories used to contain mistakes and melodrama, but lately it feels like the goal is to get one over on the women he sings about. His latest album I Never Liked You—the title sounds like a breakup note passed in the back of a middle-school classroom—has the ingredients of a really good Future album but lacks the depth of one. It plays it safe by continuing to lean too hard on the schtick.Still, Future is such a slick rapper and vocalist that his songs are pretty fun even when the lyrics feel routine. “I’m Dat Nigga” introduces a bunch of subtle yet exciting change-ups to his flow: He accelerates for a couplet, slows down for the next, and by the end, he’s in full boastful monologue mode. The eeriness of “Puffin on Zootiez” might make you believe Future is saying more than he actually is, but it’s OK because his downbeat yet rapid delivery and the ornate instrumental carry the song. The repetitive but memorable “Chickens” is a highlight, as Future embraces the cartoonish side of his character and gets a fresh burst of energy from EST Gee’s menace.But Gee is the only collaboration on the album that feels inspired; the others are so formulaic that they’re indistinguishable. Check “Wait For U” with Drake: Sampling Tems’ “Higher” is a cheat code to a catchy song, but Future and Drake are on such autopilot that I’d rather listen to the original. The other joint with Drake, “I’m on One,” wouldn’t have even made the cut for What a Time to Be Alive. “For a Nut,” with Young Thug and Gunna, is the bottom of the barrel. The song is supposed to be a sleazy, darkly funny good time, but the lyrics are so half-assed that they come off more like a parody."

That fated feeling of love and the passage of time is the theme that runs between Carly Rae Jepsen’s smash hit “Call Me Maybe” and the National’s antisocial romance “Slow Show”; it’s also the kind of thing Taylor Swift might write about. One of the loveliest tracks on Folklore, the surprise album the singer-songwriter made primarily with the National’s guitarist, Aaron Dessner, stands out for a strangely similar reason: a thread connecting two strangers that exists long before either realizes it’s there. “And isn’t it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me,” she sings on the delightfully plucky “Invisible String,” simultaneously recalling famous lines from Jane Eyre and The Sun Also Rises.Folklore will forever be known as Taylor Swift’s “indie” album, a sweater-weather record released on a whim in the blue heat of this lonely summer, filled with cinematic love songs in search of a film soundtrack. There are those who already dislike Folklore on principle, who assume it’s another calculated attempt on Swift’s part to position her career as just so (how dare she); meanwhile, fans will hold it up as tangible proof that their leader can do just about anything (also a stretch). While it’s true that Folklore pushes the limits of Swift’s sound in a particular, perhaps unexpected direction, her reference points feel more like mainstream “indie” homage than innovation, taking cues from her collaborators’ work and bits of nostalgia.At its best, Folklore asserts something that has been true from the start of Swift’s career: Her biggest strength is her storytelling, her well-honed songwriting craft meeting the vivid whimsy of her imagination; the music these stories are set to is subject to change, so long as it can be rooted in these traditions. You can tell that this is what drives Swift by the way she molds her songs: cramming specific details into curious cadences, bending the lines to her will. It’s especially apparent on Folklore, where the production—mostly by Dessner, with Jack Antonoff’s pop flair occasionally in the mix—is more minimal than she typically goes for. Her words rise above the sparse pianos, moody guitars, and sweeping orchestration, as quotable as ever.After years as pop’s most reliable first-person essayist, Swift channels her distinct style into what are essentially works of fiction and autofiction, finding compelling protagonists in a rebellious heiress and a classic teenage love triangle. In “The Last Great American Dynasty,” she tells the story of eccentric debutante Rebekah Harkness, who married into the Standard Oil family and once lived in Swift’s Rhode Island mansion, as a way to celebrate women who “have a marvelous time ruining everything.” Filled with historical details and Americana imagery, you can see the song play out in your mind like a storybook, but it also effectively makes a point about society’s treatment of brash women. Swift cleverly draws a line between Harkness and herself at the end, an idea she fleshes out in a more literal sequel, “Mad Woman.” Out of all the songs on Folklore, “The Last Great American Dynasty” is the all-timer, the instant classic. It sounds like the latter-day National/Taylor mashup you never knew you needed—textural and tastefully majestic, with Fitzgerald-esque lines about filling the pool with champagne instead of drinking all the wine."

I ...","So a couple of years ago, I was out of the city, visiting my parents in rural Eastern Connecticut. I was driving home at night, the headlights of my Camry illuminating parts of trees and branches on the sides of the road, but also leaving vast, inky swathes of shadow in which I could see nothing. It was there that I realized that, despite all the statistics and such, I felt safer in densely developed areas like my Boston neighborhood than I did in the woods. In the city, there were people everywhere-- if something terrible happened, someone was likely to see. Out here, though, there was uncertainty. You couldn't see what was out in those woods, and if anything happened to you, it could conceivably be days before anyone found you. And mind you, this was in Connecticut, which doesn't exactly have the deepest swathes of wilderness in the Union.16 Horsepower's David Eugene Edwards seems to understand this mentality deeply and taps into it quite like no other songwriter I've heard. His music inhabits the darkest corners of the American backwoods, places where shots from the Civil War and the Western frontier still echo, where it's miles to help in any direction. The haunted, creaky music on Folklore, his fifth album with this band, calls out from the traditions of Appalachian and Scottish folk, but with a bizarre, hard-to-pin sound that suggests goth country, as opposed to Southern Gothic.Lyrically, it's practically a distillation of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, with themes running from the persecution of sinners by God and demons, to murder on unimproved roads, to country paranoia. It's not a bad fit with the imagery of the Civil War documentary PBS has been rerunning this week. There's a reason for this-- four of the ten songs are covers of traditional tunes that likely date back that far. Sixteen Horsepower also try their hand at the Carter Family's ""Single Girl"", which is featured on the third volume of Smith's anthology. It's one of the few moments on Folklore where the band picks themselves up out of the dirgy murk. It has them galloping along on a jaunty banjo-driven carriage, very nearly approximating that strange, almost-in-tune-but-not-quite singing that colored the original Carter Family recordings.Otherwise, Folklore's a rather dour affair, reaching its most extreme depths on the song that immediately follows ""Single Girl"", the aptly titled ""Beyond the Pale"". Electric piano, brushed drums and vibraphone create a background wasteland, through which Edwards' weary voice travels, harassed by random intonations from an acoustic guitar. ""Beyond the pale/ We keep down our voices/ For that is our way/ Lost in the backwoods/ You awoke and found me there/ Setting the woods on fire,"" sings Edwards as though struggling to breathe.The four traditional offerings come mostly from the Anglo-American folk canon, though ""La Robe a Parasol"" is a freaky Cajun waltz. The two best come in succession: a droning, desolate take on ""Horse Head Fiddle"" that sounds nearly medieval with its backing drone and moaning vocals, and a thrilling version of Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"". The band begins the latter slowly with acoustic guitar and piano, gradually building rhythmic steam until finally breaking into a full stomp with driving drums and banjo..Taken as a whole, Folklore doesn't represent so much a new direction for Sixteen Horsepower so much as a narrowing of focus to concentrate on their most doom-laden tendencies. The album crawls from the speakers like a stabbing victim and gives up a great moan; it's a difficult listen, but the rewards are great-- see the subversively rhythmic backing of ""Blessed Persistence"" and the band's lush version of Hank Williams' ""Alone and Forsaken"". Another album like this might prove too much, but these ten songs are just about right."

Where the singer-songwriter born Elizabeth Grant had once stood onstage before a wavering projection of stars and stripes, charged by a brash apple-pie and blue-jeans patriotism, she now deemed the flag “inappropriate,” preferring a screen of static instead. For a woman whose songs are like miniature syllabi in American Studies—saturated in references to jazz, girl groups, heavy metal, Springsteen; Hemingway and Fitzgerald; money, power, glory; excess and loss; Whitmanian multitudes—it felt like an act of defiance.Norman Fucking Rockwell! is Lana at her deepest, and it arrives at a time when the history of America as we know it is being rewritten. Norman Rockwell himself illustrated idyllic images of American life and its history, spending 50 years with the Americana propagandists at the weekly Saturday Evening Post. His best-known works used a wondrous narrative style to center comfort and simplicity: A pastoral idea, painted and personified, of the American Dream. Lana neatly cuts through that outmoded fantasy with an emphatic fucking hyphen mark of irreverence, or enthusiasm, or both. As Lana revives American myths, with an empty deadpan that would make Lou Reed proud, she also exposes them. Like the Beach Boys, she’s looking for America; like Elvis, she’s discomfiting; like Dylan, she’s a trickster, and we are all potentially fooled.Lana is one of our most complicated stars, a constantly unresolvable puzzle—someone who once called her own work “more of a psychological music endeavor” than pop. But on Norman Fucking Rockwell! that ground-swelling complexity coheres to reveal an indisputable fact: She is the next best American songwriter, period. Trading much of her hardboiled trap-pop and trip-hop malaise for baroque piano ballads and dazzling folk—equal parts Brill Building precision, windswept Laurel Canyon, and 2019 parlances—Lana has begun a dynamic second act in profundity. “I really do believe that words are one of the last forms of magic,” Lana once said, and she exalts each syllable more than ever here. Where her elegant wordplay once made her the Patron Saint of Internet Feelings, she now sounds like a millennial troubadour—singing tales of beloved bartenders and broken men, of fast cars and all of the senses, of freedom and transformation and the wreckage of being alive. The stakes have never been higher.Sometimes Jack Antonoff productions seem to fly because they have been given a trampoline or a children’s bouncing castle. But here, with delicacy and grace, he and Lana find new wings in minimalism, fresh air to breathe, a structural relief. From its cascade of opening piano notes—“God damn, man child” are felicitous first words and the national mood—Norman Fucking Rockwell! achieves levity, tension, and a disarming self-awareness. The languor of Mazzy Star and downbeat skitter of Portishead meet the easy pop-rock breeze of Carole King on 1971’s Tapestry, or the searching resilience of Joni Mitchell on 1972’s For the Roses. It feels like a wall has come down, like Norman Fucking Rockwell! is less to do with camp, and more to do with real life; less to do with scripting the incandescent character of Lana Del Rey and more to do with human complexity; less about aesthetics than being. You can hear the room everywhere, and for all the spectral harmonies and cinematic splendor, it sounds like Lana alone, embracing classic Angeleno isolation."

Her brilliance is an obvious truth; just ask any teenager in America as they wait patiently for the rest of the world to catch up to their consummate taste in pop music.Of course, the 17-year-old Eilish is still waiting for her teeth to straighten out. This fact trumpets the arrival of her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?: For its intro, Eilish removes her much-loathed transparent braces in a series of lightly gross, ASMR-worthy slurps, and proclaims, “I have taken out my Invisalign and this is the album.” She then dissolves into heaving cackles, the kind that alienates any onlookers too prissy to partake. There are several more oddball moments like this—absent-minded humming to a track, giggling asides—that remind us she’s still a precocious, creative teen girl on this rocket, and all her gothic proclivities don’t cancel out how much she’s enjoying the ride.Her rise has been striking: At 14, she put the song “Ocean Eyes” on SoundCloud, a glassy, straightforward ballad with tearful synths and woozy, Lana Del Rey-indebted crooning. She snared a young fanbase with her hooks and raised her middle finger to pop’s status quo; here was this music that shifted between genres—from pop to trap and EDM—made by a lawless young female singer sporting baggy, androgynous clothes. She cast her bored, listless eyes upward instead of batting them at the camera. She filled her videos with flowing black tears, plunging needles, and arachnid hors d’oeuvres instead of twirling around sleek cityscapes. Eilish’s creepy eccentricity feels so removed from the pop formula; it helps distance her from the music industry’s historically lewd maceration of teen idols. Eilish just seems sharper, meaner, more self-sufficient—a young star from Los Angeles, in the grand tradition, but one that could only have come along while its hills are burning.The best moments of When We All Fall Asleep play firmly into this formula. Inspired by Eilish’s frequent night terrors and lucid dreams, the album juggles dark compulsions with grim eulogies, balancing her feathery vocals with deep, grisly bass. Like her spirit animal, the spider, Eilish can weave something that is at once delicate and grotesque: In “you should see me in a crown,” she lulls the listener into a false idyll with her murmured lilt, then leaps off the cliff of a tectonic dubstep bass drop, her sneer fully audible. (That the title is cribbed from Moriarty, the beguiling psychopath of television’s Sherlock, also speaks to her pull toward the sinister.)"

Look at him turning his right cheek to the camera, strands of wet hair hanging lank, a rogue petal clinging to a clump above his ear: “Sweet Creature is available now. Album is available in ten days. I am available always.” He remains an enigma after spending a half-decade in the world’s most popular boy band and dating one of the world’s biggest pop stars. And yet there’s something about Styles’ combination of roguish charm and eagerness to please that renders him exactly that: available. Leave the right Instagram comment at the right time, and he might show up on your doorstep the next morning with a bag of bagels and coffee with room. The ability to tap into this liminal space between intimacy and detachment is what makes Styles—and Harry Styles, the solo debut he’s releasing about a year and a half after One Direction’s dissolution—so captivating.If you only know one thing about Harry Styles, it’s probably that the album bucks the established trends governing bids for young male solo pop stardom. Styles is uninterested in walking the trail blazed 15 years ago by Justin Timberlake’s Justified, the one along which young male stars signal their newfound maturity by embracing hip-hop, R&B, and overt libidinousness (c.f. Justin Bieber, Nick Jonas, Zayn Malik). He doesn’t seem to care for the Sheeranesque stadium-folk being churned out by One Direction bandmate Niall Horan, either. Instead, Harry Styles wants to be a rock star—your father’s rock star, or maybe even your grandparents’ rock star. And so this sounds like the work of a musician whose desert island discs include Revolver, Tattoo You, and Vinyl: Music From the HBO Original Series - Vol. 1.Styles’ debut isn’t subject to the same pressures that defined late-period One Direction, and its songs don’t need to hold up over a year-long stadium tour. It’s still exceedingly easy to hear Styles and his band—spearheaded by jack-of-all-trades executive producer Jeff Bhasker—tip their caps to a wide variety of rock legends and also-rans. “Sweet Creature” catches Styles taking a crack at his very own version of “Blackbird”; the laughable “Woman” opens with a piano flourish out of Prince’s “Do Me, Baby” before settling down into an Elton John strut. Styles’ stabs at hard rock (the one-two punch of “Only Angel” and “Kiwi”) sound like the Rolling Stones and Wolfmother, respectively. And lead single “Sign of the Times” is a skyscraping Bowie ballad that manages to sound like both fun.’s “We Are Young”—one of Bhasker’s biggest hits—and Coldplay’s “The Scientist.” Take issue with Styles’ taste at your leisure, but there’s no denying his comprehensiveness."

It’s woozy, effortlessly melodic, and showcases her command over the pop landscape.","In March of 2020, Billie Eilish began incorporating a short film titled “Not My Responsibility” into her concerts. The shadowy four-minute clip shows Eilish slowly taking off her clothing and submerging into a slick pool of black goop, soundtracked by a spoken-word monologue about the body-shaming she faced as the most visible teenage girl on the planet. Since the release of her offbeat, gothy, Grammy-sweeping debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? one year prior, Eilish had become the media’s new favorite specimen to dissect. Specifically, her body, which Eilish often concealed beneath loud, oversized outfits. Some members of the peanut gallery applauded what they saw as a feminist refusal to be sexualized, a “body positivity” narrative that often bordered on slut-shaming women who choose to dress differently. All Eilish could do was try her best not to let it get to her. “So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief,” she murmurs on “Not My Responsibility,” “If I lived by them, I’d never be able to move.”The clip was an imperial mic drop. Unfortunately, “Not My Responsibility” played at only three concerts before the coronavirus outbreak canceled her tour and sent Eilish back home to Los Angeles. Eilish and Finneas—her brother, producer, and co-writer—hadn’t planned to make a record during quarantine. But their mother encouraged them to establish a casual writing routine at Finneas’ home studio—a nice upgrade from their previous workspace, Finneas’ childhood bedroom—and the songs that form Eilish’s second album, Happier Than Ever, naturally started taking shape.The tears that dampen Eilish’s cheeks on the cover suggest that the album’s title is more a dream than a reality. On Happier Than Ever, the newly bleached-blonde 19-year-old sifts through the rubble of an ascent so life-altering and littered with landmines that her teenage idol, Justin Bieber, once broke down crying with worry for her. From the jump, there’s a palpable sense of longing for simpler times. “Things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now,” she wearily croons on the album opener “Getting Older.”The reality of a pop star is so inherently surreal that it often borders on fantasy, but Eilish’s music has never worn tiny, rose-tinted sunglasses: Her debut’s frank exploration of mental health, addiction, and self-harm had concerned parents wringing their hands while their children rejoiced at a pop star being weird and depressed just like them. Happier Than Ever is full of admissions, plainly sung, with very little left between the lines. The things Eilish knows now are stalkers roaming her neighborhood, lovers who need to sign nondisclosure agreements, and strangers poring over paparazzi shots of her body. She doesn’t pretend that these problems are relatable, but she does know that they are just more extreme versions of concerns that plague people young and old: anxiety about how people perceive you, a desire to leave your current life behind, a fear that nothing will ever be normal again."

I ...","Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate, satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable, safe, forgettable.I have just summed up in 19 words what I am about to say about Coldplay's debut full-length, Parachutes, in 600. Aside from being seemingly tailor-made for the paper-thin adult contemporary market, what is it about this Britrock quartet that's driving them up the American charts? Is it their popularity in their home country, or their Mercury Music Prize nomination? Could it be their charming, boyish good looks? Perhaps, even, a reputation built by Noel Gallagher's projected insistence that they're ""a bunch of fuckin' pansies, the lot of them?""In reality, Coldplay's secret deadly weapon is vocalist Chris Martin. With the ability to mimic a Brit-accented Dave Matthews one minute, Jeff Buckley revived from the dead the next, and sometimes even a young Peter Gabriel, Martin's heartfelt delivery seems to be what's winning the hearts, wallets and alternative radio request lines of Americans young and old. That's not to say that the rest of the group isn't sharp. Guitarist Jon Buckland provides plaintive, strummed acoustic guitar with the occasional amplified wail, and bassist Guy Berryman with drummer Will Champion form a competent rhythm section.Oh yeah, the songs. They're nothing special. Most of the 10 tracks on Parachutes are indeed pleasant enough, often consisting of standard alterna-pop fare with the occasional folky ballad. They're innocent and inoffensive in general, but in turn, they're also exceedingly generic and immediately forgettable-- so much so, in fact, that after a minute of one song, you've usually already forgotten what the last song sounded like. And that's even after a few listens.Parachutes opens with ""Don't Panic,"" the title of which is likely lifted from British mock sci-fi classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with it. This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of ""We live in a beautiful world,"" which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record; the record also closes with the inspirational swinger ""Everything's Not Lost.""Most of the other songs sort of drift in and out of consciousness, with the exception of the second track, ""Shiver."" It's the only truly decent song on Parachutes, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's ""Grace."" Martin has his Buckley impression down cold, complete with dynamic range and the trademark vibrato. But as enjoyable as the song may be, there's no question that Buckley did it better.And of course, you've probably heard their smash hit single, ""Yellow,"" by now. Indeed, it's the most obvious choice for a single, and it represents Martin's vocal stylings effectively, but it's also the record's weakest moment. Buckland's grating, slightly tuneless guitars seem jarring, especially when sequenced in the middle of a series of songs that generally lack dissonance. And the saccharine lyrics are those that might have caused Mr. Gallagher's hypothetical remark: ""Look at the stars/ Look how they shine for you/ And everything you do."" You'd practically expect the band to show up at your doorstep with a wilting bouquet and Hallmark card.Parachutes is ultimately a promising debut for Coldplay, if by ""promising,"" I mean, ""promising them a windfall of cash and international popularity."" If nothing else, it's harmless and pretty. Unfortunately, it's nothing else. If that's what you look for in your music, by all means, go for it. If you want substance, I suggest moving on."

It carries a roaming spirit of folk and Americana without losing the romantic melodrama of her best work.","On the morning of January 11th, as she ate a popsicle for breakfast with a newly broken arm, Lana Del Rey tumbled into nearly 40 somersaulting minutes of free-associative responses to questions from BBC Radio 1 presenter Annie Mac. On live radio, the pop star parkoured from thoughts on Trump’s presidency to going to the farmer’s market barefoot to how she’d characterize at least half of her friends as jerks. Finally, her frisson found a foothold in the psychology behind the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that had taken place six days earlier. Partway through clarifying how she felt Trump’s “sociopathy” may have unintentionally inspired the deadly siege, she cleared her throat to show her conviction. “I actually think this is the most important thing I’ll say in this interview,” she underscored. “For people who stormed the Capitol, it’s dissociated rage. They want to wild out somewhere! It’s like, we don’t know how to find the ways to be wild in our world….and at the same time, the world is so wild.”In or out of context, this is an entirely fair analysis. With rare exception, the strange tradition of having celebrities act like talking heads on matters of national politics or domestic terrorism is both a largely pointless and joyless spectacle. But Lana’s monologue about the neuroses plaguing the United States was genuinely fascinating—for two reasons.The first is that, for the past decade, Lana has been an exceptional hunter-gatherer of white American arcana. In 2011, she emerged as an aesthetic howitzer, exploding a broad but deeply personal index of iconography into her own nation of death-driven kitsch. It was Xanadu, built from a blissful, degenerate, high-femme sort of jingoism. Geographies—the Hollywood sign, the tri-state, California writ large—became mythological playgrounds for her to languor around and smoke Parliaments on. Marilyn Monroe, men in training yards, cherry pies, a Pleasantville middle-class, Coachella, violence-as-romance and romance-as-violence: she offered us a canon of heritage markers recast in ’10s-era drama and became the rare sort of talent that was able to congeal past and present into seductively conceptual cinema. With time and refinement, Lana Del Rey had mushroomed into what we called the next best American songwriter—emphasis on American.The second reason was more obvious. The original purpose of the BBC interview was to promote her newly released single titled “Chemtrails Over the Country Club,” and the album that shares its name. Whether meant to be tongue-in-cheek, a joke, or not one at all, the title’s flawless alignment with the mood and mien of that moment—the conspiracy-mindedness, the radiant gloom, the fragility, and the suggestion of the type of person associated with the words “country club”—was an act of poetry. It was remarkable to hear the bard of white American malaise suggest which delusion was gripping the nation."

Much like relationships themselves, the songs on his self-titled debut LP are full of contradictions.","The opening track on Cigarettes After Sex’s self-titled debut album is a slow-as-molasses alt-rock ballad simply titled “K.” It chronicles lead singer Greg Gonzalez’s infatuation with a girl named Kristen, and pinpoints the very moment their relationship shifts from strictly casual to something more substantial. “We had made love earlier that day, with no strings attached/But I could tell that something had changed,” Gonzalez croons in a voice close to a whisper. And while he seems to have cinched the deal with the girl in question, the song ends on an elusive note: “Stay with me/I don’t want you to leave...”Kristen’s initial is also the death knell of modern romantic communication, the wretched abbreviation for “OK,” the text message equivalent of rejection by indifference. Without a doubt, Cigarettes After Sex is an album of love songs, but it’s tempered with a millennial ennui that gives the songs an extra layer of relevance in 2017. Instead of relying on lovey-dovey, pastoral lyrics to tell stories of budding relationships, each song is set to a backdrop of ultra-downbeat dream pop, its somber moods leaking into fleeting vignettes of sexy iPhone videos and bittersweet hookups. The record plays like a cryptic guidebook to navigating the world of contemporary love affairs, or the slightly depressing diary of some 21st century Don Juan.Sonically, Cigarettes After Sex is an impressively even-keeled, slowcore collection—so even-keeled that it borders on ambient. It’s easy to write a bunch of slow songs with similar chords, but it’s an altogether different feat to produce, mix, and compile them in a way that their similarities become their strengths, gradually setting an unshakable mood. At first the repetition of certain elements—echoing guitars, soft hi-hats, elastic basslines—seems overbearing. But after multiple listens, Cigarettes After Sex’s less-is-more ethos is clear, and their heady melange of several genres of subdued indie rock begins to make more sense.The album possesses strong aspects of alt-country in its reverberated, plucked guitars and shuffling snares, immediately bringing to mind groups like Cowboy Junkies and Mojave 3. But then you encounter a track like “Sunsetz,” whose dreamy intro owes a considerable debt to mid-era Cocteau Twins, before dropping almost all instrumentation in its verse to showcase Gonzalez’s boyish vocals. “Sunsetz” is so loose, and with so much space, that it should be boring; instead, it’s electric, the emptiness forcing you to focus on Gonzalez’s stark lyrics and clever composition. “So you open your dress and show me your tits/On the swing set at the old playground,” he sings, not really as a command, but almost as a general observation.The theme of sexual encounters as fodder for quiet introspection continues throughout Cigarettes After Sex, but it’s delivered in such a nonchalant way that it avoids corniness. “Sweet” opens with the line “Watching the video that you sent me/The one where you’re showering with wet hair dripping,” before turning into a song about longing to touch a loved one’s skin through a screen. A catchy late-album highlight, “Truly”’s chorus goes, “Truly, know that you really don’t need/To be in love to make love to me.”Much like relationships themselves, these songs are full of contradictions. The objects of Gonzalez’s desire are both achingly close and tantalizingly far, in his phone and in his bed, on his couch and in his head. Through wallowing in its own mire and coming out the other side, Cigarettes After Sex becomes one of those restrained, low-boil albums where tempo, repetition, and muted composition construct an entire story within the pauses between the notes and the ideas between the lines."

To kick off his first full-length in five years, the platinum-selling Irish singer-songwriter celebrates the legends who spoke truth to power, as he shouts out a veritable VH1 marathon’s worth of greats: Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, John Lennon, James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Mavis Staples, Patti Smith, Marvin Gaye, and more are name-checked during the opening song “Nina Cried Power.” The message is simple. All of these people made a difference, and, whoever you are, wherever you are, at least one of them probably means something to you. Why dwell in hopelessness when you can join the choir?It’s a well-meaning call to action that’s paid dividends in the past. “Take Me to Church” is both the title of Hozier’s career-making 2013 single and also his imagined purpose as a songwriter—a purveyor of good will, packaged in radio anthems designed to be sung at the top of your lungs. In his music and interviews, the soft-spoken 28-year-old is passionate about noble causes, from LGBTQ awareness to the Irish nurses’ strike and the opioid crisis. Standing at six-foot-five, with chiseled features and the occasional man-bun, the mononymic singer even has a kind of Christ-like aura, or at least downmarket Russell Brand. His mother, the visual artist Raine Hozier-Byrne, designed his latest album cover in a process that involved submerging her son underwater for extended periods of time: “I had said to mum,” he joked dryly, “Just try to think of the album sales if I do die on this shoot!”Another thing: he’s got a gorgeous voice. Booming and effervescent, it’s an instrument that communicates passion, adventure, and wisdom, all to the extent that transcribing his lyrics seems to be somewhat missing the point. There’s a reason why most people didn’t realize that “Take Me to Church” is a protest song about the Catholic Church. Like Foster the People’s similarly out-of-nowhere smash “Pumped Up Kicks,” it seemed to ascend the charts solely on hummable hooks and crowd-pleasing adrenaline. Such strengths are a sweet but elusive currency. Analyze a beautiful day and it’s already over. At 14 tracks in roughly an hour, Wasteland, Baby! falls prey to the humdrum, all its power wrung dry.The record’s pitfalls are nothing new for major-label artists attempting to follow a surprise hit. Nearly every element of “Take Me to Church” is isolated and recycled here in the hopes of crowning a successor: God is not in the house. The aid of a gospel choir doesn’t make the awkward one-word refrain of “To Noise Making (Sing)” sound like something worth singing along to, just as the slow-build, stomp-clap murk of “Movement” mostly invites you to avert eye contact from the back of the room. Even just the central refrains of these songs—Sing! Move! Now!—suggest an unbecoming directness. Rock stars make us want to join in on the fun; wedding singers and youth group leaders demand it."

Bandleader Ellen Kempner set her scenes in bedrooms and in grocery stores, singing tightly wound vocal melodies over wiry, anxious guitar riffs. On the Boston band's third album, Kempner breaks down the walls. Black Friday reaches far toward the hazy horizon, letting the nervous energy of Palehound's first two LPs mount and unspool.Kempner wrote many of the songs on A Place I’ll Always Go during a period of grief after a close friend passed away. That weight lifts on Black Friday, which bubbles around the thrill of new love, and also reckons with the stress that falling deeply for someone can bring. Love, both romantic and platonic, can erase self-consciousness in the moment, but it can also heighten self-scrutiny later. Opening yourself up to another person can drive you to ask all sorts of uncomfortable questions about yourself: Am I enough? Can I be enough? What can I do to be enough?Palehound wade through this space with a skillful grip on their newly expanded rock toolkit. A couple of synthesizers and drum machines bookended A Place I'll Always Go; here, those accents get fleshed out, woven in alongside long, languid, reverb-heavy guitar lines. The stunning “Killer,” a menacing Western number about taking cold-blooded revenge on a male abuser, punctuates its chorus with sprinkles of saloon piano. “I wanna be the one who kills the man who hurt you, darlin’,” Kempner sings, perfectly poised, as if her shotgun’s already slung over her shoulder. She barely raises her voice above a stage whisper, which only adds to the song’s chill. It’s not a geyser of white-hot rage, but a cold, calculated expression of venom toward a  deserving target. It’s also a brilliant reclamation of the sounds of the Western, a film genre whose women don’t always make it out alive.“Killer” brings Palehound to some of their darkest places yet, but Black Friday also opens space for moments of levity. With their quick-strummed acoustic guitar and playful vocal melodies, “Urban Drip” and “Stick N Poke” could almost be Sheryl Crow singles from the early aughts. “I think I’m due for a shitty tattoo,” Kempner proclaims at the chorus of the latter, which is such a spectacular way to say “fuck it” that it sounds like she’s running barefoot through summer grass.But nothing else on the album, or in the rest of Palehound's discography, quite compares to the joy of “Aaron,” a song Kempner wrote for her partner as he navigated a gender transition. “My friend, if you want me to/I’ll call you Aaron/I can, I can, I can, I can,"" she sings a little breathlessly. The “I can” becomes a refrain, sometimes morphing into “I will,” an urgent, excited affirmation. The instrumentation—nimble guitars and big, booming percussion—keeps building and ebbing away until finally, in the song’s final seconds, it erupts, a little like the climax of Perfume Genius’ 2012 stunner “Hood.” The moment’s ecstatic, a rush of affection where uncertainty gives way to unconditional acceptance, and it cements “Aaron” as one of the best love songs you're likely to hear in a while.Kempner has excelled at tracing anxiety, fear, and shame through expertly crafted rock songs, and there’s still plenty of those emotions throughout Black Friday—the title track and “Worthy” both tackle the feelings of inadequacy that can attend even the most uncomplicated love. But on her third record, she also allows herself to experience pure joy, and what a treat it is to feel that euphoria along with her."

First it was with a song called “All Girls Are the Same,” which is obviously bratty and stupid, but also sneakily catchy and endearing in the way it casts Higgins as a bit of a heartbroken doofus. “Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it,” he sings in a monotonous drone. Another single quickly followed, and Juice WRLD’s first official album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, fell out of the sky just months after news he’d signed a deal with a major label. As a result, Higgins feels a bit like a ringer who has been hidden from view and unveiled all at once.It’s possible Higgins has enjoyed such a rapid climb due to the familiarity of the emo-rap he trades in. But that same familiarity can nag at the ear and force comparisons. He can sound warbly and frustrated—one part Lil Yachty and one part Post Malone—or depressed and histrionic, like Lil Peep and nothing,nowhere. To be sure, Higgins has latched onto this wave of emo-rap in both sound and lyrics, and Interscope has invested in his timely recipe of weepy trap because he’s such a convincing aggregate of the sound. If there’s an urgency to Goodbye & Good Riddance it’s not so much what is inside the album, but the timing of its delivery.Goodbye & Good Riddance is an adolescent breakup record, and it’s accordingly cathartic, petty, and clumsy in its emotional processing. It’s as hard to like Higgins as it is easy to pity him. The album cover signals some of this schtick with a campy anime drawing of Higgins doing a burnout, sticking his middle finger out the window, and literally leaving a woman in his dust. It’s a small-minded, juvenile gesture that fits hand-in-hand with that lead single and the general sulkiness of the rest of the album. Higgins sings at a persistent “you” throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, but he’s clearly self-obsessed in a moment of torment, paralyzed by heartbreak but not to the point that he can’t crawl in front of a mirror to glance at himself fall apart. For Higgins, heartbreak is performative and despondency is chic.Thankfully, there’s an emotional immediacy to the music and Higgins is doing more than just spinning his wheels. He sings often in weepy groans and emo snarls that match the blunt rawness of his lyrics, even if he’s in the habit of telling instead of showing his feelings (“Who am I kiddin’?/All this jealousy and agony that I sit in”). He also often grimaces through vapid clunkers like “I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay/I know it's all in my head.” These aren’t lyrics that can be delivered with tact, and Higgins hams it up at every turn. What he lacks in narrative, he makes up for in moody hooks, to the point that the nursery-rhyme simplicity of his singsong couplets can wash away the groaning melodrama of a line like, “I’m on the drugs way too much” and needle it into your skull. The tragic upshot of the album—love sucks, drugs help—is as productively communicated by song titles like “I”ll Be Fine,” “Scared of Love,” and “Hurt Me” as the lyrics inside of them.The more pressing accomplishment on Goodbye & Good Riddance is that Higgins has crystallized the sonic footprint of this emo-rap moment. The production is handled mostly by Higgins’ frequent collaborator Nick Mira, who encourages the maudlin effect of Higgins’ writing with mawkish synth atmospheres and fidgeting trap snares; the same current runs through the whole tracklist like a wet blanket.Other than the cringey voicemail skits peppered throughout, Higgins stands alone on the album without a single feature to accompany him. Even if his draw is relatability, it could have scanned awkward to hear Higgins share this space with anyone else. Throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, his heart-on-his-sleeve coping sounds both ingratiating and grating. In that way at least, he’s bottled up sad sap adolescence remarkably well."

He’s not 17 in Riverdale casting years. He presents as an actual high schooler, complete with braces and glasses that look straight off of a CVS rack—a pointed departure break from the outsized stylist budgets and Manic Panic color palettes of rap’s biggest, youngest stars. That’s about where the distinction from his peers ends, though. Tecca’s look may be unique, but his sound isn’t.The Queens-born rapper rhymes in the melodic patter of New York sing-rap phenom A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, with a flow that splits the difference between Chief Keef’s gruff irritability and Gunna’s glycerin slickness. He’s got a strong voice and natural instincts, and although his flow is completely secondhand, it’s precisely pitched to the moment, especially when his songs glower their way into Juice WRLD incel-rap territory. That rapper looms especially large over We Love You Tecca. Juice WRLD’s producers Nick Mira and Taz Taylor helmed Tecca’s breakthrough hit “Ransom,” and he contributes the album’s only guest feature, on a remix of that track.Tecca’s success story has played like a smaller scale echo of Lil Nas X’s, another internet-savvy young rapper who built a listenership online too big for major labels to ignore. After millions of streams on SoundCloud and a viral video for “Ransom” on the taste-making YouTube channel Lyrical Lemonade, Tecca inked a deal with Republic Records, making him labelmates with Drake and Ariana Grande. His rise may not have stirred an all-consuming debate about genre classifications or resuscitated Billy Ray Cyrus’s career, but it’s always impressive seeing an artist so young cut through the industry’s yellow tape so quickly. Some rappers grind their whole lives for their moment. Tecca netted his between Xbox Live sessions.Still, he could benefit from putting a little more work in. It’s not for nothing that Tecca harps about guarding his flow on “Ransom,” because throughout We Love You Tecca he clings to it like a tennis player trying to fake his way into the pros with only one serve. That flow sounds fantastic on “Ransom,” and even better as it figure-skates through the tuneful “Shots.” But Tecca wears it into the ground over the course of the album’s repetitious 40 minutes, especially in its second half, as his tracks bleed into one endless rewrite of each other."

For six minutes, the chatty rapper talks in circles as he enthusiastically footnotes a verse that isn’t exactly loaded with cryptic subtext. The line, “First place when I finish the race,” he explains, means “basically, like, I’m just coming in first,” for instance. If anything, he reveals that his lyrics may actually have less meaning than they appear to have on the surface. At one point, he admits that he doesn’t know what an Uncle Tom is, so for him, the term just signifies an old, cranky uncle—a hater, basically.Lil Skies is grinning the whole time, so it’s hard to tell if he fully appreciates the absurdity of the exercise. He’s so charming and such a good sport about it, though, that you want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Consider the video a litmus test for his music: Either you’re drawn in by his considerable charisma, or flabbergasted by the inanity of half of what comes out of his mouth. Like so many zeitgeist-chasing rappers in his age bracket right now, he invites hard opinions.It’s lucky that Skies has charisma to spare, because he won’t wow anybody with his originality. He adheres to a “look the part, be the part” mentality, styling himself after SoundCloud rap’s preferred uniform of dreadlocks and face tattoos that may as well read RIYL: Lil Uzi Vert. “I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation/I can never get a job so for my dream I’m dedicated,” he raps on the opening track of his debut mixtape Life of a Dark Rose, an easygoing 40 minutes of sugary trap and mellow, blissfully hazy vibe music that runs with the sounds of the moment without advancing them much.Skies doesn’t try to outdo his flashier peers. He isn’t as radical as Lil Pump, a far less competent rapper who makes up for his limitations with raw energy, and although he sings about being a rock star, he doesn’t act the part like Lil Yachty. What he does bring to the table, though, is an agreeable demeanor and a pleasant, sticky-sweet singing voice with shades of Swae Lee, which he’s comfortable enough with to forgo the Auto-Tune that makes so much of this music bleed together. Leaving his voice naked is his smartest and most distinguishing aesthetic choice. It lets Dark Rose breathe in a way most mixtapes in this lane don’t.The whole project goes down easy, although it only periodically makes good on the promise of its flagship single “Red Roses.” That’s the track where Skies’ melodious flow matches with a perfectly woozy beat and everything clicks (it’s also got the tape’s most Teflon hook: “I got all the drugs in the world that you need/We get high to pass the time, but bitch I ain’t no fiend.”) Only a handful of songs come close to capturing that rush, including “Signs of Jealousy,” another track with the plush ambiance of an opium den, and “The Clique,” a daffy number with more than a trace of Playboi Carti in it. A few more of their caliber could have turned the tape into something genuinely notable, but at least its second-tier material is agreeable enough. Even when Skies isn’t saying much—and he’s rarely saying much—he sounds good doing it."

Each line is rendered in careful, writerly fashion, his voice barely produced and almost never doubled, so there is often little to distinguish chorus from verse. Memories, boasts, threats—all of it simply spills out. His songs are informed by the drill music that Polo grew up on on Chicago’s North side and once tried to imitate, but also borrow from rap’s more classicist branches. This approach was perfectly crystallized on Die a Legend, his arresting debut album from last year, which plays like an LP made up exclusively of the bloodlettings that sneak onto some albums’ B-sides. Its hits seem inevitable outgrowths of Polo G’s larger approach, the way its verses slide naturally into hooks. And the world it creates is unspoiled by outside interference: no treacly A&R-insisted beats or clumsily grafted features. It was easy to get lost inside.Polo G’s follow-up, The Goat, is not quite so shut off to the world. Its front half is especially adventurous, folding in kinetic collaborations with rappers from North Carolina and Tennessee and tender love songs. It is not the singularly engrossing experience that Die a Legend is, but it argues for him as an adaptable and unmissable talent, an unlikely star in a new major-label system. When he does return to that well of somber reflection, Polo G draws some of his most chilling material yet: see the desperate “Relentless,” where he tries to convince skeptical friends: “Heaven ain’t the only way we can escape up out the gutter.”It cannot be overstated how plain Polo G’s preferred syntaxes are, and how unsettling an effect they can have depending on the subject matter. This is, after all, a young rapper whose biggest hit includes a chorus that goes “We come from poverty, man, we ain’t have a thing.” When he raps about pain or trauma from his childhood and teen years, he often refers to them as “pain” and “trauma”; rather than make his music vague, this clarity is a helpful guide through dense verses packed with detail. Take the shimmering “No Matter What,” where he laments that his new money and power can’t bring back his departed friends: “But my homies died young and that wasn't part of the plan/Flying on these planes, wish I could reach and touch your hand/I don't wanna be awake, that's why I keep popping these Xans.” The problems are laid bare and the solutions are destructive, but the music—its lyrics and its sound—is always searching for a sort of exaltation."

The influence of the two pumps through the veins of Lil Baby and Gunna, just as it does any rapper who debuted in the city after 2014. The similarities between the two mixtapes are glaring as it’s a duo of Atlanta-bred melody-driven rappers that spit so damn well with each other, aware that if they go hard enough this is their shot at superstardom. But where Lil Baby and Gunna separate themselves is a chemistry and brotherhood that few rap duos can lay claim to.The chemistry of Lil Baby and Gunna breeds competition as the mixtape becomes a showcase of two rappers at the top of their game attempting to out-flex the other: If Gunna just copped a new coat, Lil Baby got a superior one that cost $6,500, and if Lil Baby has a VLONE hoodie, Gunna has the same one but in every color. They revealed their world of drip earlier this year when “Sold Out Dates” set the blueprint for Lil Baby and Gunna’s rapping style: a string-sampling instrumental from ATL mainstay Turbo, melodic Gunna hymns dedicated to his designer, and the gruffer bars of Lil Baby still acclimating to this life of showboating. This alchemy shapes Drip Harder into the rare major label collaborative mixtape that’s not on cruise control.From the beginning, Lil Baby and Gunna are all-in, recruiting high-profile guests like Lil Durk and Nav to follow their lead on a track definitely titled in a 2018 hip-hop name-generator, “Off White VLONE.” Gunna ushers everyone into the piano-laden world where not much matters other than if your belt buckle matches your Balenciaga runners. The duo calls on Drake to go in over the Tay Keith drums he loves so much on “Never Recover” and although Drake’s borrowed flow can’t keep up with Lil Baby and Gunna, none of their guests can, except for Young Thug. As their idol pops in on “My Jeans,” sliding in a chorus between their two short verses and it’s like a Dad taking his two sons to the basketball court to play one-on-one.Drip Harder thrives when Lil Baby and Gunna are alone, in their element, battling while also making sure to fill their quota of VLONE product placement (for instance, VLONE rims?). On “Drip Too Hard,” Lil Baby finds his melodic sweet spot on the hook only for Gunna to attempt to upstage him with smooth vocals that manage to keep his rapid delivery intact, all while tossing in a few boasts that are probably lies, but those are the best ones (“TSA harass me, so I took a private plane”). Their chemistry takes center stage on “Belly,” as Gunna passes his flow onto Baby who at this point is so confident he even celebrates his scent (“Spend thousands on fragrance she fuckin’ my odor”).The shortcomings come to light every time Baby and Gunna separate. When Turbo doesn’t have both Baby and Gunna flowing their asses off, his monotonous drums patterns grow tiresome. A few of his beats blend into one another, and he’s just not versatile enough to carry a project on his back. And even the bouncy Gunna solo track “Style Stealer” features Gunna comically unaware that dressing like Willy Wonka is not a flex (“Flawless choker round my throat/Icy cane like Willy Wonka”).Lil Baby and Gunna’s chemistry is a refreshing splash in an Atlanta hip-hop scene that has felt stagnant. It’s the duo establishing themselves, knowing they have some limitations, but capitalizing on what they do well. And even if they break up over some pettiness like Rich Gang, Drip Harder will be remembered as a moment that let hip-hop know it had two new superstars draped in “designer to the floor,” which, as Gunna said, “I can barely spell.”"

In late 2017, he was released back into the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, with a promise to his mother that things would be different. At first, he fell back into his old ways, skipping school to run the Bronx streets. Then, he stepped into a studio for the first time and recorded his breakout single “Resume.”On “Resume,” Lil Tjay sing-raps in a soft voice about his crushes with the charm of a mischievous early 2010s teen R&B star (think Prodigy of Mindless Behavior). At the same time, he reflects on the drug addicts he passes on his block everyday and the friends he’s lost while incarcerated. He perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid in a New York environment that rapidly forces you to mature. That conflict only becomes more profound on the singles that followed “Resume,” which he began uploading to YouTube every month or so. “Long Time” is a bittersweet ode to all of the friends he’s lost; “Goat” reflects on the low points he’s overcome; “Brothers” dredges up the past he’s still trying to distance himself from. By the end of summer 2018, Tjay’s melodic sense was refined and his stories tapped into an emotional honesty that made him a relatable breakout star in New York.Lil Tjay’s music was always suited for singles. There’s nothing wrong with that; so much of rap is consumed through playlists and YouTube videos. But when stretched across a 17-track album, like his debut, True 2 Myself, issues that were irrelevant before begin to surface: uniform vocals, half-cooked production, and writing that pulls from the same stories.True 2 Myself is more like a compilation than an album. On “F.N,” Tjay’s vivid reflections are given life by lush piano. “I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain/I ain’t have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain,” he raps, while keeping a steady melody. The album’s intro, “One Take,” is Tjay at his sharpest; every line over the sparkly keys has a purpose, especially when he addresses comparisons to fellow Bronx crooner A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie: “They said I’m the new A Boogie, relax/I ain’t never tried to copy his swag.” Each of these songs is just as good, maybe better, than early tracks like “Goat” and “Brothers”—both land on the album—but lose some of their luster when they’re all run together, and padded out with blander versions of the same piano-heavy street tales (“Dream That I Had,” “Post To Be”).The album format gives Tjay a little room to stretch, something that’s nearly impossible when he’s only releasing one single a month. Some experiments work, like the traditional R&B ballad “Mixed Emotions.” The “BET Uncut” slow jam “Sex Sounds,” meanwhile, is way too much: Hearing him sing “The way you kiss me when I’m stroking deep inside” is like finding porn in your little brother’s internet history.Lil Tjay wants to grow up, and an album feels like part of that process. But Tjay didn’t need an album; he notched a Billboard Top 15 single and became one of the rappers leading New York’s melody-driven scene without one. True 2 Myself is a playlist of soon-to-be singles grouped under the industry-formality heading of an “album.” Inevitably, one of these brooding piano ballads will catch on, followed by another, and Tjay, just like he did less than two years ago, will go on another run."

First it was with a song called “All Girls Are the Same,” which is obviously bratty and stupid, but also sneakily catchy and endearing in the way it casts Higgins as a bit of a heartbroken doofus. “Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it,” he sings in a monotonous drone. Another single quickly followed, and Juice WRLD’s first official album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, fell out of the sky just months after news he’d signed a deal with a major label. As a result, Higgins feels a bit like a ringer who has been hidden from view and unveiled all at once.It’s possible Higgins has enjoyed such a rapid climb due to the familiarity of the emo-rap he trades in. But that same familiarity can nag at the ear and force comparisons. He can sound warbly and frustrated—one part Lil Yachty and one part Post Malone—or depressed and histrionic, like Lil Peep and nothing,nowhere. To be sure, Higgins has latched onto this wave of emo-rap in both sound and lyrics, and Interscope has invested in his timely recipe of weepy trap because he’s such a convincing aggregate of the sound. If there’s an urgency to Goodbye & Good Riddance it’s not so much what is inside the album, but the timing of its delivery.Goodbye & Good Riddance is an adolescent breakup record, and it’s accordingly cathartic, petty, and clumsy in its emotional processing. It’s as hard to like Higgins as it is easy to pity him. The album cover signals some of this schtick with a campy anime drawing of Higgins doing a burnout, sticking his middle finger out the window, and literally leaving a woman in his dust. It’s a small-minded, juvenile gesture that fits hand-in-hand with that lead single and the general sulkiness of the rest of the album. Higgins sings at a persistent “you” throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, but he’s clearly self-obsessed in a moment of torment, paralyzed by heartbreak but not to the point that he can’t crawl in front of a mirror to glance at himself fall apart. For Higgins, heartbreak is performative and despondency is chic.Thankfully, there’s an emotional immediacy to the music and Higgins is doing more than just spinning his wheels. He sings often in weepy groans and emo snarls that match the blunt rawness of his lyrics, even if he’s in the habit of telling instead of showing his feelings (“Who am I kiddin’?/All this jealousy and agony that I sit in”). He also often grimaces through vapid clunkers like “I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay/I know it's all in my head.” These aren’t lyrics that can be delivered with tact, and Higgins hams it up at every turn. What he lacks in narrative, he makes up for in moody hooks, to the point that the nursery-rhyme simplicity of his singsong couplets can wash away the groaning melodrama of a line like, “I’m on the drugs way too much” and needle it into your skull. The tragic upshot of the album—love sucks, drugs help—is as productively communicated by song titles like “I”ll Be Fine,” “Scared of Love,” and “Hurt Me” as the lyrics inside of them.The more pressing accomplishment on Goodbye & Good Riddance is that Higgins has crystallized the sonic footprint of this emo-rap moment. The production is handled mostly by Higgins’ frequent collaborator Nick Mira, who encourages the maudlin effect of Higgins’ writing with mawkish synth atmospheres and fidgeting trap snares; the same current runs through the whole tracklist like a wet blanket.Other than the cringey voicemail skits peppered throughout, Higgins stands alone on the album without a single feature to accompany him. Even if his draw is relatability, it could have scanned awkward to hear Higgins share this space with anyone else. Throughout Goodbye & Good Riddance, his heart-on-his-sleeve coping sounds both ingratiating and grating. In that way at least, he’s bottled up sad sap adolescence remarkably well."

He’s not 17 in Riverdale casting years. He presents as an actual high schooler, complete with braces and glasses that look straight off of a CVS rack—a pointed departure break from the outsized stylist budgets and Manic Panic color palettes of rap’s biggest, youngest stars. That’s about where the distinction from his peers ends, though. Tecca’s look may be unique, but his sound isn’t.The Queens-born rapper rhymes in the melodic patter of New York sing-rap phenom A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, with a flow that splits the difference between Chief Keef’s gruff irritability and Gunna’s glycerin slickness. He’s got a strong voice and natural instincts, and although his flow is completely secondhand, it’s precisely pitched to the moment, especially when his songs glower their way into Juice WRLD incel-rap territory. That rapper looms especially large over We Love You Tecca. Juice WRLD’s producers Nick Mira and Taz Taylor helmed Tecca’s breakthrough hit “Ransom,” and he contributes the album’s only guest feature, on a remix of that track.Tecca’s success story has played like a smaller scale echo of Lil Nas X’s, another internet-savvy young rapper who built a listenership online too big for major labels to ignore. After millions of streams on SoundCloud and a viral video for “Ransom” on the taste-making YouTube channel Lyrical Lemonade, Tecca inked a deal with Republic Records, making him labelmates with Drake and Ariana Grande. His rise may not have stirred an all-consuming debate about genre classifications or resuscitated Billy Ray Cyrus’s career, but it’s always impressive seeing an artist so young cut through the industry’s yellow tape so quickly. Some rappers grind their whole lives for their moment. Tecca netted his between Xbox Live sessions.Still, he could benefit from putting a little more work in. It’s not for nothing that Tecca harps about guarding his flow on “Ransom,” because throughout We Love You Tecca he clings to it like a tennis player trying to fake his way into the pros with only one serve. That flow sounds fantastic on “Ransom,” and even better as it figure-skates through the tuneful “Shots.” But Tecca wears it into the ground over the course of the album’s repetitious 40 minutes, especially in its second half, as his tracks bleed into one endless rewrite of each other."

Last October, Florida prosecutors allege, Melly and rapper YNW Bortlen shot and killed two fellow YNW rappers then staged the crime scene to make it appear like a drive-by. Melly, who surrendered himself to police in February and faces life in prison or the death penalty, has maintained his innocence and continues to carry on his rap career as best he can. But judging by the relative silence that’s greeted his debut album, Melly vs. Melvin, his commercial prospects may be almost dire as his legal ones.Melly vs. Melvin has a difficult public-relations needle to thread, presenting a portrait of a teenager who definitely didn’t do what the prosecutors have accused him of but also, you know, totally could have. “I’m a slimeball and I’ll admit it,” he raps on the opener “Two Face,” pinning his transgressions on an alternate personality. The record’s cover quite literally depicts those two faces, one sweetly boyish and looking no older than his 20 years, the other considerably more hardened. It’s a powerful concept, evoking the dueling images that the media often uses to depict young black men and suggesting how easily their portrayals can be spun. It’s a shame the idea is wasted on an album as superficial as Melly vs. Melvin, which pads Melly’s precious few original ideas with second-rate material and third-rate Young Thug–isms.Since Melly’s been behind bars for most of the year, it’s unclear when this material was recorded. The murder allegations are never specifically mentioned, yet several songs vaguely create the illusion that he’s addressing them. “Can you hear me, father? Can you please send me some signs?/I’ve been going through some things, there’s been a lot on my mind,” he pleads on “Waitin on You,” along with a pledge to keep praying.Melly’s contrition isn’t especially convincing, however, nor is he effective at engendering sympathy. It doesn’t help that his default persona is downright sour. He directs “Suicidal” to the “stupid bitch” who “took my heart and made it bleed.” On “Stay Up” he offers this peevish retort: “Bitch, I ain’t mentally challenged.” Twice he berates women in his life for having had, or having considered, an abortion.On his previous projects, including January’s considerably more enjoyable We All Shine, Melly distinguished himself from his many SoundCloud variants with a ’90s R&B influence that he employed on his most sumptuous songs. But aside from a few outliers like “Bang Bang,” which samples the Nelly/Akon/Ashanti track “Body on Me,” and “Nobody’s Around,” which slows things down with a bit of an R&B bump, there isn’t much of that spirit here. Melly began the year as a rising star sharing a video with Kanye West, but even morbid curiosity and the sordid details of his case haven’t done much to sustain the public’s interest in him, and assuming that Melvin is the best music he had left in the vault, that doesn’t bode well for his prospects either."

The “I don’t really care if you cry” taunt that shouldn’t be believed melting into “All my friends are dead/Push me to the edge” is a stretch of masterful songwriting, but withering in a way that few artists could mimic without tipping into self-parody. Its commercial benchmarks—No. 7 on Billboard, Platinum three times over—don’t come close to capturing the depth with which people feel the song. It will probably define Lil Uzi Vert for the rest of his career.Which is fine, because artists have been plagued by hits with just a fraction of the pathos “XO Tour Llif3” has. But Uzi has been an ascendant star for at least a year and a half: from promising rookie to SoundCloud darling to rap’s A-list and beyond. He’s proven himself a popular force with solo cuts like “Money Longer” and guest turns on Migos’ “Bad and Boujee” and Playboi Carti’s “Woke Up Like This”; dozens, hundreds of imitators across digital mixtape platforms cite him as a major creative influence, or at least a welcome distillation of whatever’s happening in and around the Atlanta scene. And yet in some small way, Uzi’s long-awaited Luv Is Rage 2 is a referendum on whether he can live up to the standard “XO Tour Llif3” set. The goal isn’t a streaming figure or a chart position, but a feeling.Lofty as that is, Luv Is Rage 2 comes very close to delivering. At its best, the album mines the psyches of exhausted and exhausting people, searching for the moment where enough drugs or heartbreak or iMessages or sleep deprivation can unlock a new part of the brain. It’s the Philadelphia native’s most musically developed work and features a bulk of his most interesting songs to date.Take “The Way Life Goes,” which is produced by Don Cannon and Ike Beatz. Uzi opens with a brief introduction to the other half of his failed relationship, punctuated with, “I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her.” From there, he launches into a full interpolation of the first verse from Oh Wonder’s “Landslide”: “I know it hurts sometimes, but you’ll get over it/You’ll find another life to live.” Uzi’s less interested in the granular drama of the breakup than in the fallout, the moment three or four days later when reality starts to set in."

After releasing a solid buzz-building free studio album, Days Before Rodeo, last year, Scott follows it up with his long-awaited major debut, Rodeo, a master class in the pyramid scheming of rap industry politics.","There are few emerging artists more polarizing than Travis Scott, he of the dual deals (Grand Hustle as a rapper and G.O.O.D. Music as a producer) and the punk rock antics, a Kanye West progeny who is continuously changing shape. One minute he’s Kid Cudi, the next he’s Young Thug. The rager has made a living parlaying aesthetics into musical capital, but there’s value in his ability to repackage styles and sounds into something that requires little to no unpacking. After releasing a solid buzz-building free studio album, Days Before Rodeo, last year, Scott follows it up with his long-awaited major debut, Rodeo, a master class in the pyramid scheming of rap industry politics.Travis Scott studied carefully at the Kanye West School of Maximalism, where sounds are expensive and songs are sumptuous with rich, interlocking details and meticulously selected guests. Since releasing his debut EP, Owl Pharaoh, in 2013 (and perhaps even before) he’s been honing a sixth sense for emphasizing gravitas. His greatest trick is making songs feel big and important. But Scott has cobbled together a composite identity to compensate for lacking his own. He’s quickly earned a rep as a shameless biter, an aesthetic bender with no regard for ownership or authorship—a claim given credence by Rodeo’s second single, the Swae Lee-imitating ""Antidote"".This has become the enduring criticism of Scott’s work so far: That he’s a skilled impersonator posing as a creative, a mime playing puppetmaster. (There are at least three alleged reports of creative theft, which led to this takedown in Deadspin.) But this narrative overshadows the more glaring holes in his music. Travis Scott isn’t good at rapping—he often bawls out clunky phrases that dawdle into banality (""Always hit the gas like I broke wind"")—and his self-proclaimed status as an auteur isn’t dictated by his own talent, but by the talent of those surrounding him. ""Who do I owe? Nigga, no one,"" he boasts on opener ""Pornography"", when he’s actually deeply indebted to those in or adjacent to the Kanye Think Tank and the others he’s wrangled based on that affiliation.One thing Scott does very well is squirm through openings onto bigger platforms, which is a talent in and of itself. He is one of rap’s premier young capitalists, an opportunist deft in the use of social currency, turning a friendship with Illroots creator Mike Waxx into a relationship with T.I. and finagling a meeting with Kanye West out of networking with his engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer. The strength of his catalog is almost exclusively dependent on the strength of his connections."

It’s bleak and beautiful.","At 21, Juice WRLD had begun to master the world around him. He could wed the sounds of influences like Billy Idol and Chief Keef and create something entirely different. As a songwriter, he could pair an airy melody with lyrics about heartbreak or drugs, and given the chance, fire off marathon freestyle sessions on a whim. A wunderkind with many imitators on SoundCloud, he sounded far more polished, far beyond whatever his closest peer was attempting to accomplish. When he died in December 2019, days removed from celebrating his 21st birthday, it opened up yet another wound for a generation of rap fans struggling to hold on to the new voices that spoke for them.Juice WRLD brought people from outside the margins into his crystalized world of vulnerability in a dash towards mental freedom. His most fervently repeated lines doubled as yearbook quotes or quickly deleted tweets. His closest supporters, such as producer and longtime collaborator Nick Mira, have kept his legacy close to them, maybe more so than any other group of fans who recently lost their champion. Juice asked those fans to trust him—and the people who supported him—as if they were family. Legends Never Die, the Chicago artist’s first posthumous release, doesn’t feel like a final goodbye from Juice but instead a continued look inside his world.Across three major releases—Goodbye & Good Riddance, WRLD on Drugs, and Death Race for Love—Juice proudly kept himself at a distance while pining for love, bringing fans closer to his truth while still keeping his guard up. The bulk of Legends Never Die sifts through his thoughts as he battled anxiety in the face of stardom. He understood the game he played and how it kept him centered: “If it wasn’t for the pills, I wouldn’t be here,” he sings on “Wishing Well.” It’s a bleak and beautiful world he’s created, one where the most poignant moments are buried in candor and honesty.Throughout Legends Never Die’s 56 minutes, Juice’s delivery is conversational and evocative as he checks off the perks of success and the lingering doubts (“Just got a new house, gotta hide the skeletons in the closet”). The emo-heavy sounds that blossomed on Death Race’s “Robbery” and “Empty” have now morphed into a fully developed ecosystem where all of the sounds and keys are built around Juice’s frame of mind. Mira’s touches on Legends Never Die don’t appear until the harrowing “Righteous,” where sparse guitar plays underneath Juice’s confessional: “Taking medicine to fix all of the damage/My anxiety the size of a planet,” he sings. Pop heavyweights such Dr. Luke and Marshmello grab the mantle on “Wishing Well” and the pop-rock ready anthem “Come & Go,” where Juice thanks God for allowing him grace and support."

Chinx was a street savvy rapper with solid pop instincts and singsong sensibilities (not unlike his label boss French Montana) who was cut down just as he’d begun to blossom. His posthumous debut album, Welcome to JFK, was a reflection of his promise, and served as both a finely-curated introduction and a proper send-off. JFK was a swan song capped by the closer “Die Young” with the powerful and prescient final bar “I pray I be okay when I grow up a little bigger/If I don’t, tell my babies daddy was a real nigga.” As endnotes go, it doesn’t get more fitting than that. So releasing another record postmortem, with a myth-building title like Legends Never Die, feels suspiciously like a branding play, less concerned with eulogizing Chinx’s art and instead setting its sights on his legacy. In its rush to glory, Legends Never Die becomes the one thing a legacy album can’t be: forgettable.When remembering Chinx’s brief career, listeners should refer to his Cocaine Riot mixtape series, which fully captured his bellowed melodies and joyous dope dealer romps without the stakes. In an attempting to build an obelisk out of scraps, the stakes are simply too high on Legends Never Die and these hard-drive cloggers couldn’t hope to live up to them. The songs are all clearly outtakes from the same cobbled together sessions and recordings that birthed Welcome to JFK—it has the same cast of producers (Blickie Blaze, Young Stokes, Lee on the Beats, Austin Powerz, and Remo the Hitmaker) and many of the same guests (Montana, Meet Sims, and another verse from the late Stack Bundles), only worse execution. The feature verses are bland and the album is poorly sequenced. The middle section is scattered and uneven, sandwiching a grating poacher tune like “Slide Up in Ya Bitch” in between a ballad (“Yeah I Do”) and a ride or die anthem (“Real Bitch”). The album should end with the Montana-assisted “Legendary,” but doesn’t. None of these tracks are among Chinx’s best or even his most fun work, and attempting to use them to cement his legend, ironically, seems shortsighted.Despite missing its mark, Legends Never Die isn’t without purpose—it's still refreshing to hear new Chinx verses and hooks, which are surprisingly earwormy. In a way, the album unfolds as the Book of Chinx, recounting how he lived and died: getting rich selling coke, living a luxurious lifestyle, and trading shots with bitter enemies and jealous rivals. A song like “Around Me,” which applies “fuck nigga” repellant, reads like his mantra and there’s some haunting foreshadowing in lyrics like “Shit a nigga seen, couldn’t live through it/Nigga used to stop at the red light/Now a nigga dip through it.” (There’s even a bar about coming through the block in a Porsche.) But inside these songs he’s present; he wins, he reflects, he prays, he jokes, he loves, he loots, and he lives. For 50 minutes, Chinx breathes again.When Legends Never Die is working well, it embodies Chinx’s spirit, showing off his versatility in the process. The strobing “For the Love” finds him in full croon, delivering one of his strongest vocal performances of his career with Meet Sims at his back. On “Crown Royal,” he wades into a wave of heavy 808 bass with choppy cadences crowning himself a coke kingpin (“Got the accolades on the corner/Dope from Peru, sniff from Tijuana”). “Like This,” which features smooth Chrisette Michele background vocals, is radio ready with plush synth arrangements and a hook that rattles around the brain. He does his cleanest writing on “Match That,” challenging competitors to match his accomplishments and drawing parallels in the same breath.In fits and starts, you can hear the gears turning; Chinx was finding his rhythm and might’ve developed into an astute craftsman given time. Now, all that remains are the drafts he left behind. Legends Never Die won’t preserve his legacy, but it’s another reminder of what could’ve been."

His voice on the mic is distinctive, a high-pitched whine well-suited to jokes and boasts, but Hykeem Carter, the man behind the persona, often receded from view. Personal details in his music and interviews were scarce, and Keem outright hid his face until he began promoting his 2018 project, The Sound of Bad Habit. Even after revealing himself, he remained tight-lipped, but that didn’t stop eagle-eyed fans from noticing his name in the songwriting and producer credits of Top Dawg Entertainment albums like the 2018 Disney collab Black Panther The Album and Jay Rock’s Redemption. Rumors swirled that Keem was actually Kendrick Lamar’s cousin and merely benefitted from rap nepotism, but as Keem’s popularity and mystique grew on the heels of his 2019 breakout project Die For My Bitch, he kept his distance and mostly let his boisterous music speak for itself.Nepotism or not, the rollout (or, according to former TDE president Dave Free, the “well-executed plan”) for Keem’s debut studio album The Melodic Blue telegraphed a more personal, or at least less secretive, direction for him. He publicly embraced his relationship with Lamar, signing with Lamar and Dave Free’s pgLang collective and releasing the tag-team track “family ties.” The album’s trailer is soundtracked by “scapegoats,” a brief but somber reflection on family that hits a bit closer to home (“Flowers on my uncle’s tomb, thousands to my auntie’s, too/I’m used to taking backstreets, last week was nothing new”) before drawing the curtain back again. While The Melodic Blue is indeed flecked with more intimate writing than usual, it isn’t exactly a confessional. Instead, Keem uses the opportunity to expand his well-established fascination with trap and melody to feature-length—with mixed results.On earlier projects, Keem showed a skill for hopping between rapping and singing, sometimes within the same song. Whether he was screaming “Baby Keem just humbled a model!” on “STATS” or cooing about his indifference toward anyone’s opinions on “Opinions,” it felt like a natural progression, the same artist coming with a different approach. Some of that synergy remains on The Melodic Blue, and the highs are exhilarating. His opening verse on “family ties” is easily among the best of his career. Keem triumphantly skips over horns and thudding 808s with a handful of flows and reminisces on childhood Popeyes trips while puffing out his chest (“It’s a red dot, don’t get on the wrong red-eye”). Both “pink panties” and “first order of business” see Keem switching effortlessly between melody and bars about paying for lace fronts and thanking his mother for her love and support. When he sticks to what initially made Two Phone Baby Keem a success, it’s easy to understand the initial hype."

Quickly after releasing Un Verano Sin Ti, he made stops that reflect two major themes of the album. The first was a cute, intimate celebration at the last Puerto Rican social club remaining in Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the Caribbean Social Club (also known as “Toñita’s” after one of its owners, Maria Antonia Cay). As one of the most regarded Latinx-owned bars to survive the area’s gentrification while also preserving Boricua history, its existence symbolizes resistance. The day after, he appeared in the Bronx to record a music video for one of the album’s highlights, the upbeat hip-hop dembow fusion “Tití Me Preguntó.” Sporting a T-shirt honoring bachata legend Anthony Santos—whose “No Te Puedo Olvidar” is sampled at the beginning of the track—he was seen turning up with Dominican youth, taking part in the street revelery known simply as teteo. This release-week schedule reflects two of Un Verano Sin Ti’s animating forces: Benito’s bori pride and appreciation of Dominican culture.Recorded in his native island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, Un Verano Sin Ti is a cohesively packaged voyage through the various sounds synonymous with the Caribbean region—reggaetón, reggae, bomba, Dominican dembow, Dominican mambo, and bachata, among others. The album’s 23 tracks are conceptualized through an A side and B side scheme that separates high-energy party and fun sonidos from tranquility and conscious thinking. Its enticing musical patchwork further lures listeners into El Conejo’s universe of experimental arrangements, sharp and nostalgic synths, and unexpected genre fusions. It’s a loving ode to Caribbean culture that embraces marginalized scenes within Latin America, from the ostracization of Black-rooted genres like bachata, dembow, and mambo to the criminalization of reggaeton.Since his early Latin-trap beginnings (which he nods to here on “Dos Mil 16”), Bad Bunny’s adventurous tastes have catapulted him to become one of the most prolific global tastemakers. That versatility, paired with impeccable delivery, wordplay, and lyricism, has permitted him to exist creatively in a way no one else in Latin music, specifically within El Movimiento—to push the boundaries of gender conformity and fashion, for example, while simultaneously branching out to wrestling and acting. His range is represented throughout his discography, which spans pop-punk-meets-trap tracks like “Tenemos Que Hablar” (from 2019’s X 100PRE), “Hablamos Mañana” (2020’s YHLQMDLG), and “Yo Visto Así” (El Último Tour Del Mundo, his second album of 2020 and the first all Spanish-language album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200). As he’s gone on to become Spotify’s most-streamed artist two years in a row, Bad Bunny has set records never before seen in the industry.

I care about you ...","I'm not going to lie to you, kids, and I want you to know that. I care about you. (Well, most of you.) So I'll be honest. Rock isn't always pretty, but sometimes that's just the way it's gotta be. Believe me, then, when I say that Rye Coalition's new album, On Top, is downright ugly, but rocks like it's about to go out of style. So all of you who just want another pretty face can stick to the safety of The Strokes and Weezer. In the meantime, Rye Coalition is gonna be busy defining arena-ready indie rock without any pretty-boy theatrics, so get out of the way or be crushed underfoot.On Top is so relentlessly energetic that from the moment Rye Coalition begins to stomp and bruise their way through the album, no one stands a chance. Once they get moving, all you can do is be dragged through the mud behind them. By the time the album ends, you're filthy, the wind has been knocked out of you and your organs hurt from the impact, but, like Loverboy, you've loved every minute of it. The only 'break' to be found is on the bluesy ""Freshly Frankness,"" which wouldn't exactly sound out of place on White Blood Cells-- if, uh, Jack White took steroids.But before I forget, the lyrics suck big time. If they're tongue-in-cheek, Ralph Cuseglio's delivery is too straight-faced to let on. Don't worry too much, though, since lyrics only matter if you can understand them-- which in this case you can't. (Just don't open the liners and you'll be fine.) Cuseglio spits and froths his way through every song with such manic adrenaline that he must be hooked to some kind of goddamn rock and roll I.V. And for their part, the rest of the band matches him, with jagged guitar lines dominating and kicking like a gas-powered mule (you heard me). On the rare occasions when Justin Morrey's bass is able to bust through the mix, I can hear Shellac-- and I probably don't need to tell you, but that's a good thing.Now, this is a pretty straightforward album, so the possibilities do exhaust themselves somewhat by the end; there's only so much that can be done with this sort of visceral, no-frills rock. But just as doubts regarding this album's staying power creep in, the showpiece closer, ""Honky, Please,"" shatters them Conan-style. The track is immediately set apart by the awkward opening sounds of seagulls and a garbage truck in reverse gear, before it launches into a menacing guitar riff. The instrumentation builds, collapses under its own weight, then resurges with such a massively gut-wrenching crescendo that nothing can follow it. So nothing does.Rye Coalition may not be what anyone had in mind when rock and roll was developed, but that's only because they weren't thinking hard enough. Did I mention the record was engineered by Steve Albini? If you don't take my word for it, at least trust Steve not to steer you wrong. Steve says, ""On Top is a juggernaut of an album."" Believe it, kids."

But their collaborative 2014 album Piñata succeeded because the two are equally uncompromising: Madlib tailors beats to his eclectic ears alone, while Gibbs insists that he can rap over anything. Kindred spirits, the pair bonded through mutual gumption.On follow-up Bandana, the bond deepens. Madlib’s beats remain off-kilter, and Gibbs remains gangster, but there’s a looser feel to this record, a spirit of intuition and intimacy. Their overall recording process didn’t change much: Madlib sent beats and Gibbs rapped over them as is—samples, pauses, breaks, and all. This time, though, they made the effort to meet in the studio and review different mixes and edits, to calibrate. The result is a keener sense of each other’s presence. Moving in lockstep, Gibbs and Madlib pull themselves deeper into one another’s worlds, forging a new one in the process.On Piñata, the duo bridged Gibbs’ street sense and Madlib’s throwback flair by embracing the sounds and attitudes of blaxploitation. Smoky soul drifted out of every crevice, drugs flooded the streets, and middle fingers never came down. The general vibe was defiant, gritty, and nostalgic, fitting the back-to-basics spirit of a proud lyricist linking with an inveterate crate-digger. Bandana is palpably more unhinged, less rooted in a particular time or style or mood.The through line is black freedom. Across the record Gibbs mentions various black figures and tragedies, from the transatlantic slave trade (“Flat Tummy Tea”) to Baltimore drug kingpin Melvin Williams (“Education”) to basketball star Allen Iverson (“Practice”) to the death by police bombing of mass shooter Micah Johnson (“Soul Right”) to Tupac’s assault on the Hughes Brothers (“Massage Seats”), weaving a grand, ambiguous tapestry. Gibbs has been talking black power in various forms since his early mixtapes, but here he’s less certain about what it looks like, who embodies it, how to secure it. As he takes a fuller view of his life and the fates of his idols, he grows more cautious. “I can’t move the same/I gotta readjust how I maneuver,” he insists on “Gat Damn.”He’s kept on his toes by Madlib’s strikingly robust production, which is maximal compared to his revered lo-fi sound. “Half Manne Half Cocaine” begins with ticking hi-hats and bass kicks topped by twinkly bells, then spazzes into a torrent of cymbals and sampled shouts—trap by way of EPMD. The scuzzy riff on “Flat Tummy Tea” is stretched, distorted, and splashed with atonal effects that evaporate into a breakbeat. Madlib has always been an unsparing producer, but this is one of the few times he’s allowed himself to be baroque."

The song is a blast of righteous rage, Bob Marley's youngest son unleashing a towering, bulletproof torrent of abuse at the inequalities in his home country of Jamaica, singing about tourists ""on the beach with a few club sodas"" while kids kill each other a few miles away, all over a skeletal track of chest-slamming digital drums and synthetic skank. Songs like that don't come along often, so it's not a knock on Welcome to Jamrock to say it never approaches the power of its title cut.It would've made sense for Marley to attempt to recreate the song's blazing old-school one-drop roots fury throughout the album, but he opts instead to veer all over the musical map with about half the album barely sounding like reggae. The album's opener, ""Confrontation"", finds Marley in full-on prophet mode, singing, ""Any day, revolution might erupt/ And the skies over Kingston lighten up."" It seems like a fitting sequel to ""Jamrock"", except that it trades in that song's rootsy skank for synthetic martial drums and ominous, sawing soundtrack strings. Other tracks draw on the slick breakbeats and sampled funk-guitar stabs of late-80s new jack swing; it's not much of a surprise when Bobby Brown turns up halfway through the album. The expert sex jam ""All Night"" has a rolling throwback beat that could've come from Marley Marl in his prime. A handful of other songs are simply straight-up dancehall, weird coming from the guy who is supposedly at the forefront of reggae's move away from ragga; ""Hey Girl"" even sounds something like a laid-back take on T.O.K. (This is a good thing.)Refreshingly, Marley sounds very little like his father. He's got a strained, abrasive voice with very little in common with Bob's honeyed coo, and his Jamaican accent is so deep and thick that it's often hard for American ears to tell what he's saying. On ""Beautiful"", he namechecks his father alongside the smooth dancehall loverman Super Cat, and in his lighter moments, Marley sounds strikingly like the latter. But on the sad, gorgeous Nas duet ""Road to Zion"", his voice is a weary, lonely sigh reminiscent of Horace Andy. Marley only recalls his father once on ""We're Gonna Make It"", a lush, burbling, melodic old-school reggae track, a style that Marley simply can't do anywhere near as well as his father. Much more powerful is ""Move!"", a song that samples his father's ""Exodus"", adding rushing drums and quick-tongue chatting that become increasingly passionate and frantic as the song progresses. When the drums drop out and Bob's voice comes in on the chorus, it's breathtaking.But despite all its great moments, Jamrock doesn't hold together as an album; its constant stylistic switch-ups keep it from ever building into a whole. The missteps on the album are especially glaring. The Bobby Brown collaboration ""Beautiful"" is ruined by a cheesed-out smooth-jazz session-musician saxophone, while ""Pimpa's Paradise"" enlists the Roots' Black Thought for a boring, condescending woman-gone-astray lament. ""For the Babies"" is a pretty-enough ballad with an orientalist synth riff, but its lyrics are some pro-life bullshit that Pat Robertson would probably approve. And then there's the title track, a song so great that it dwarfs the rest of the album. Marley will be lucky if he ever equals it."

I was on the beach this weekend on a sunny day, and the air was still freezing. The local clam shack and ice cream stand had opened but the people in line were wearing windbreakers; this year's scoop girls are only just starting to build the biceps that they'll take to school next fall.It doesn't get hot enough in Portland, Oregon for music like this, and maybe that's why Chad Crouch and Blanket Music recorded Move in the South Pacific, on balmy Island 734-001 of the Bikini Atoll. They're joined by the beautiful voices of Esperanza Spalding (of Noise for Pretend) and Corrina Repp, who sound as smooth as ice against a hot torso. ""Shut up and sway your hips,"" they implore, and the tropical songs and warm recording couldn't sound more like an afternoon at a bar by the beach. They even put a cocktail umbrella in the spine of the disc, to illustrate what you're missing.Crouch says this is party music, and it is, though it's also good hangover music: soothing and free of shrill noise. The hooks are so subtle and laid-back that it can take a few listens to appreciate Crouch's catchy songwriting-- most notably on ""K - A - R - A [breathless] O - K [keep it coming] EEEeeeeeeeee,"" where his droopy-dog vocals and clever lyrics dance over a catchy guitar riff. Greg Lind's drumming is limber but restrained, and even the drum machine that augments the music is nicely integrated-- as on the hot jazz-meets-IDM ""Itchy Popcorn,"" which builds to speaker-shaking bass. Crouch is a low-key frontman with a thin, melodic voice, perfect for the tone of this record, and he and Ross Seligman play killer staccato lines on guitar.I'd expect American bossa nova to be as bad as other Americanized ethnic creations, like American ska, or American chop suey. In addition to having a stand-up band, Crouch succeeds by not pretending to be anything he isn't-- instead of posing as a smooth island loverboy, he sticks to wry lyrics and mundane topics. He has three jobs: as a musician, as a designer, and as the head of this label; and he likes to talk about the need to slow down. Like the 'to do' list that's set to a beautiful tune on ""Walk the Dog,"" or his potshots at hip visual artists in ""Hot Designers."" He writes witty love songs about (though not necessarily to) his ""incredible"" girlfriend, who he describes so sweetly in the liner notes that I winced hoping they haven't broken up since this came out. For example, the cutesy interplay in ""Tap the Beat"" (He: ""And if I lost my legs..."" She: ""I would put you on my back/ And I would grab things off the shelf for you""). Hey, guys, get a room!On a song like ""Costa Del Sol"" there's genuine yearning in Crouch's voice, the note of sincerity that makes it compelling and not just exotic. What does he yearn for? Maybe his girlfriend, though she probably hangs around plenty; maybe something as global as world peace, as on ""Get Togetha."" But more than anything, it sounds like Crouch wanted to vacation in a warm place and to party. And on the defrosting boardwalks, in the last gusts of New England's waning chill, that's good enough for me."

When the pandemic began, she decamped to her family’s home in Maine, where she reconnected with nature and wrote a collection of songs called Surrender—which is also the name of her 2022 Harvard Divinity School thesis. Oh yeah: While working on the follow-up to her 2019 debut Heard It in a Past Life, Rogers was enrolled in a year-long masters program focused on the presence of religion in public life. For the 28-year-old singer-scholar that meant considering questions like: Does an artist hold a responsibility to their audience? And how can performance be a conduit for a transcendental experience?If it sounds a little Ivy League Hannah Montana—finals by day, Met Gala by night—Rogers’ return to academia served her well. On Surrender, she sounds renewed, submitting to the pull of her heart without apology. She plays hooky from adulthood on the upbeat “Be Cool” and gives into her carnal instincts on “Want Want”; she’s turning off the radio and listening to the wind instead of suffering through “that song I’m supposed to know/By some fucking bro,” as she teases on “Anywhere With You.” She’s still processing her whirlwind rise to fame, and learning what to prioritize: “Took me all this long to figure out/It’s not worth it/If I can’t touch the ground,” she sings on the ballad “Horses,” which uses the titular animals as a symbol for the freedom she so badly desires.The album itself reflects Rogers’ newfound autonomy: She’s trimmed back on her debut’s stable of producers, co-producing Surrender herself alongside Kid Harpoon (Harry Styles, Shawn Mendes). One of the best moments, the escapist fantasy “Anywhere With You,” was co-written with an old friend, Holden Jaffe, who makes music under the name Del Water Gap (Rogers performed in an earlier version of the project while in college). On the song, Rogers lifts a companion out of their existential malaise before the pair hit the road in search of something bigger than themselves. Like so many road songs, it’s also a declaration of devotion, a commitment to journeying forward together even as their thoughts on forever differ: “You tell me you want everything you want it fast,” Rogers bellows atop a cathartic crescendo that would not sound out of place on an early Arcade Fire record. “But all I’ve ever wanted is to make something/Fucking last.”"

Maybe last year's DJ mix album, the reasonably decent Brothers Gonna Work It Out, should have been the clue, but Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons have clearly been raiding a library- sized record collection since their last offering of ""original"" music.""Music: Response,"" the album's leadoff, starts like a ride on the Autobahn with Kraftwerk circa the mid '70s, with its analog synth blips and monotone computerwelt voices, before tossing in some ferocious beats to bring Krautrock into the new millennium. The mood carries through on ""Under the Influence"" with more Kraftwerk- styled noodlings. Meanwhile, their best instrumental effort is ""The Sunshine Underground,"" an eight- and- a- half minute ride through chiming tones, wafting flute- like sounds, and sputtering and gurgling synths that intertwine with the briefest of dreamy vocals. Actually, it wouldn't have been out of place on the last Orbital album.Surrender will receive a ton of hype based on its superstar guest appearances, and none more historically relevant than ""Out of Control"" with New Order's Bernard Sumner on vocals. Being electronic dance music freaks from Manchester, New Order is like the holy grail to the Chemical Brothers and it's easy to see why. The Chemicals share with their Manchester predecessors an obsession with hypnotic, melodic, dance beats. ""Out of Control"" works so well it could be a lost track from Low Life. After his turn on ""Setting Son"" with the Chemicals in 1996, Oasis' terminally out- of- style Noel Gallagher returns for another psychedelic, Beatles-esque anthem on ""Let Forever Be,"" again snagging the rhythm track from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" off Revolver.Surrender is both the Chemical Brothers most immediately satisfying work and, perhaps not coincidentally, the most like a rock album of their career. Unlike a fair share of techno, these songs feel like ""songs,"" not a collection of clever samples and a race to the fastest BPM on the planet. Yeah, you can go out and buy your jungle, your trance, your trip-hop and your ambient, but why would you when you'd be sacrificing the greatest gift of all: Surrender's love and understanding."

The title of the latest installment in Clams Casino’s long-running beat-tape series implies that the tracks have been scavenged and preserved, like fading artifacts of a forgotten epoch. Michael Volpe wasn’t the only producer weaving ambient textures into trap beats at the start of the last decade—an era where experimental artists like Shlohmo and Evian Christ collaborated with the likes of Kanye and Drake—but few artists were linked as closely with the subgenre.Clams’ influence on hip-hop has remained at the elemental level; his work with rappers like Lil B, A$AP Rocky, and Soulja Boy truly shifted the sonic window. Without Clams, it’s hard to imagine Yung Lean or Drain Gang, and rap’s ongoing infatuations with the alternative rock spectrum might not be so passionate either. Clams was out there sampling Thursday in 2011, and now he works alongside a new generation who would probably not be making music without his influence: Lil Peep, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Ghostemane, and Nedarb, who credits “I’m God” as the beat that made him want to start producing.Instrumental Relics contains many of Clams’ most notable early collaborations (Soulja Boy’s “All I Need,” A$AP Rocky’s “Numb”), as well as three tracks from his Rainforest EP on the late Tri Angle records (“Treetop,” “Drowning,” “Gorilla”), an original cut from the Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack (“Crystals”), and a handful of other strays. Most were previously available and have only been remastered here, but “I’m God”—the definitive Clams Casino recording—can now be officially streamed as a standalone piece of music for the very first time. The instrumental’s unforgettable sample has gone from an unapproved flip to a full-fledged feature, with Imogen Heap credited alongside Clams Casino.“I’m God” was instantly iconic, immediately imitated, and impossible to recreate. Like Clams’ most haunting work, it decays and disintegrates inside your eardrum, more like a Burial composition than what you’d normally expect to hear Soulja Boy rapping over—the kind of thing I wish Mark Fisher had gotten to write about. For all its innovation and ethereality, there’s something timeless about “I’m God,” with drum programming that skews more boom-bap than trap, betraying Clams’ roots in New Jersey and his love of the East Coast’s classics — one of his first collaborations was with Havoc of Mobb Deep."

They dress like spangley futuristic mime robots, which I suppose is sort of annoying, but that really doesn't have anything to do with their music. They bankrupted their record label and waited way too long to put their first album out, but again, all that stuff is strictly extra-musical. They actively and knowingly marketed themselves as electroclash, but Fischerspooner has much more in common musically with the Scissor Sisters than Miss Kittin or A.R.E. Weapons. They've never managed to make anything as great as their first single, but then ""Emerge"" was such a dizzy, searing monster jam that it'd be hopeless to hold any group to that standard forever.So the only real reason I can think of to hate Fisherspooner is the vwerdle-vwerdle-vwerdle oscillating synth-bass sound they use on every single song. This can grow tired after an entire album, but it's a good, malleable sound, as effective on breathy, luxuriant opium-disco tunes like ""A Cloud"" as on swooping, lazy filter-Fleetwood-Mac tracks like ""Happy"". And plus you can ratchet up the pitch a bunch on the chorus and the song will automatically sounds way more intense.On Odyssey, the group piles on huge, clattering drums, mournful house pianos, deliriously sleazy strutting white-funk guitars. The album's production is clean enough to sterilize needles; everything has a lavish, glossy cocaine sheen. The group has recruited help from pop-music pros like Mirwais (who produced Madonna's ""Music"", which is fucking awesome) and Linda Perry (who wrote Pink's ""Get This Party Started"", which is fucking awesome). They got the now deceased Susan Sontag to write the lyrics for ""We Need a War"", which is nice, but it's not like anyone ever listens to the lyrics on Fischerspooner songs.Odyssey is Fischerspooner's attempt at kicking and screaming their way out of punchline hell, so it's a bit of a surprise how good everything sounds. The deluxe, swirley disco tracks that begin the album slide nicely into the brittle new-wave funk and imperiously sighed synthed ballads. All of this builds beautifully to the group's cover of the Boredoms' smeary psychedelic symphony ""Circle"". It's something of a shock hearing the Boredoms' messy drum-circle monolith translated through Fischerspooner's glammy synths, but the group approaches the song with the majestic fervor it demands, and the result is a truly gorgeous pileup.Odyssey isn't a great album: Many of the vocal hooks are weak and underfed, the group never finds the widescreen abandon of ""Emerge"", and there's that synth burble on every song. But the group has managed to come up with an appealingly grand, ridiculous epic, more than anyone could reasonably expect from these forgotten freaks. So find some other band to hate. May I suggest Kings of Leon?"

Daft Punk seem to be operating under the premise that if you hear something enough times, you'll start to believe it. But after more than 15 listens to Discovery's first single and opening track, ""One More Time,"" vocodered vocalist Romanthony doesn't have me ""feeling the need,"" much less not waiting, celebrating, and dancing so free. This could just be me, of course. Maybe I just haven't taken enough ecstasy and horse tranquilizers to appreciate the tinny, sampled brass ensemble, the too-sincere ""chill out"" midsection, or the fat drum machine beats that throb in time with my headache.Few things are more incriminating than Daft Punk's own lyrics, which, while generally deeper than ""don't stop the dancing,"" rarely go beyond sensitive junior high poetry and ""could this be love"" Whitesnake-isms. But music like this wasn't meant to be judged on its lyrics. And since Discovery relies heavily on the French neo-disco stylings established by 1997's Homework, the duo would probably suggest we shut up and dance.In truth, Discovery rarely invokes its predecessor's slap-bass funk, and few other tracks resemble the obviously single-designed ""One More Time."" Instead, Daft Punk focus on fusing mid-80's Kool and the Gang R&B; beats with post-millennial prog flourishes and more vocoders than you can shake at Herbie Hancock. Of the six tracks that feature vocals, four are smothered with the synthesized pitch corrector. On tracks like ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,"" the duo make it work by pushing the instrument to its breaking point, squeezing out subhuman glips and merging the vocals into a Vai-style synth-guitar solo. But when the band relies on the tool merely as a gimmick, as on ""Digital Love"" and ""Something about Us,"" the sentimental love songs come off with all the heart-melting earnestness of Kid Rock's ""Only God Knows Why.""Daft Punk typically succeed in an instrumental environment, though. Discovery's first big score comes with the rousing ""Crescendolls."" The obscure Imperials sample makes the song with spirited ""hey's"" and ""everybody y'all's"" yelled out from a crowd. ""Superheroes,"" which draws its repeated refrain from a late 70's Barry Manilow track called ""Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed,"" sates with a massive, fist-pumping kickdrum, complex chord changes, and light-speed keyboard bleeps. The snapping percussion and Phantasy Star II phaser synths of ""Verdis Quo"" recall a somber Flashdance-era Giorgio Moroder. And the 16-bit pitch-bent tones and Klymaxx electro-bass of ""Short Circuit"" would have felt at home on Trans Am's Surrender to the Night.Prog and disco have never openly begged for their own hybrid, but the genres' newborn Frankenbaby is alive, whether we like it or not. Still, this beast, however grotesque, is relatively harmless-- rather than running amok in the village and snapping the necks of civilians, it only wants to ""celebrate and dance so free, one more time."" Just don't let it sing."

That line, about sticking to your given path as a lifer, shows up on Wolfe's fifth full-length, Abyss, during the smeary, intense late-album standout ""Color of Blood"", and it's a fitting sentiment for her heaviest (and best) collection to date.Wolfe has incorporated metallic elements into her music since the beginning—especially on 2013's Pain Is Beauty—but she's never really gone full-on metal. And, honestly, she still hasn't, but on Abyss she comes closer than ever, externalizing those tendencies. She's thrown in moments of distortion, animal-like growling, or hiss on her other records, but it could come off like an affectation or add-on; here, it's built into, and integral to, the music, which frequently booms with distorted doom-metal guitar.Recorded in Dallas by John Congleton, Abyss features Wolfe's longtime collaborator, multi-instrumentalist and co-writer Ben Chisholm, plus regular drummer Dylan Fujioka and viola player Ezra Buchla. The real difference is Mike Sullivan, guitarist for mostly instrumental Chicago post-rock band, Russian Circles. Wolfe sang on the sole vocal track on Russian Circles' excellent 2013 album, Memorial; he returns the favor here, adding an anthemic dimension to a handful of the tracks that you won't find in her other work.  Overall, this is the first time you feel like the music consistently lives up to the power of her voice.The other big difference: She previously produced her albums with Chisholm, and they've done a fine job, but Congleton makes everything sound so much bigger. The production is ambitious—in the past, it could sometimes come off as a bit ill-fitting or unnatural. On Abyss, the sound is fully realized, her voice always at home. Congleton is a prolific producer, who's worked with the likes of Swans, Angel Olsen, Explosions in the Sky, and St. Vincent. If you focus on that small sampling, you'll have an idea of what Wolfe sounds like on here: The songs don't wait around, or take time to build—they are immediately full on, and never stop raging. Wolfe's early work felt solitary, like it was made, and meant to be listened to, alone. The music here is expansive, and teeming, and you can easily imagine it on a large stage, with a crowd singing along."

Today, we revisit a teenage fever dream, the mainstream pop-punk debut of Avril Lavigne.","Avril Lavigne’s origin story would be the perfect American fairytale if it wasn’t so undeniably Canadian. She grew up in Napanee, Ontario, a small town best known for its proximity to the country’s largest highway and its selection of fine truck stops. She sang Pentecostal hymns in her family’s church and performed in local productions of Godspell and You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. It was little more than an average, provincial life.When the nearest big-city country station held a singing contest, a 14-year-old Lavigne sent in a tape for a chance to sing with none other than Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop superstar. Lavigne didn’t just acquit herself: She won the damn thing, which meant driving two-plus hours to the nation’s capital and belting Twain’s brassy 1993 hit “What Made You Say That” in front of a packed Ottawa hockey arena. At the time, Lavigne told Twain she wanted to be “a famous singer.”Lavigne had no idea how quickly her dream would come true: Within a few years, she’d be sneering on the cover of Rolling Stone in a black tank top and a curt plaid skirt, winkingly labeled “the Britney slayer.” The onetime country-pop princess who performed hits by Faith Hill and Sarah McLachlan at an early record label audition had become a gleeful anarchist, a pop-punk supernova who skated through videos for hits like “Complicated” and “Sk8er Boi,” causing chaos in ratty T-shirts and neckties. She wasn’t disingenuous or calculating; she was a teenager, one whose formative experiences and changes in taste were taking place while she navigated the expectations that come with a major-label record deal. The reaction between Lavigne’s volatile energy and the music industry’s commercial imperative produced her 2002 debut Let Go, a rebuttal of Spears-Aguilerian pop—overtly sexual, vaguely urban, hyper-processed—churned out by the exact same kind of hit factory. It boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.While Lavigne’s ascent from local radio contests to the top of the charts seems rapid in retrospect, her career took shape in fits and starts. Nine months after she appeared on stage with Twain, Cliff Fabri—the manager who shepherded her through the earliest phase of her career—watched her sing country karaoke in a Kingston, Ontario Chapters, the Canadian equivalent of being discovered in a college town’s Barnes & Noble. “I was thinking of her as another Sheryl Crow. They both had the same small-town roots,” Fabri told The New York Times in 2002. “Then I was thinking Fiona Apple, because of her independence. She definitely had attitude. So my line was Sheryl Crow meets Fiona Apple.”"

Just takes you right back, like any good one-hit wonder should. And remember how, after the Kennedy raves and MTV Beach House success of that song, Nada Surf did the graceful thing by fading quietly into obscurity and K-Tel royalties? That was really cool of them. Uh... they did fade quietly into obscurity, right?Hells no! Like the equally mystifying continued existence of their pan-flash peers Superdrag (sigh, WhosuckedouttheFEEEELAAAAAANNNNN!!), Nada Surf insists upon fading away rather than burning out. So now, they're dropping down to the minor leagues and trying to ignore showgoers' wiseass heckles as they tour America's low-overhead venues. If you're anything like me, there's a little voice inside of you saying, ""Dude, weird, they're still around? Shouldn't they be headlining the John Deere Alternative Rock Stage at the State Fair by now? Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so long outlived their original fifteen minutes?""Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little voice, who never did you no good anyhow. Let Go's only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds. Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny.Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say  the DB's and  The Replacements-- that'll suffice. All well and good, but the band also carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays.Said crimes include:Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"".Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the protagonist listening to Blonde on Blonde in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"".Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?).Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats.But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous ""Treading Water"". Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on Let Go, are gleefully shined into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to ruining albums by both Pavement and Phish.Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps. I'll admit, though: If forced to defend one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought. No, I'm afraid Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with Let Go, and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired."

There's not going to be any stories of how I patronized the laundromat before I listened to this album. So, here, this is what you need to know: Café Tacuba is one of the best bands in the world. When their eponymous debut saw release in 1992, there was certainly an overwhelming supposition that Café Tacuba was destined for greatness, but by 1999's double-disc Reves/Yosoy, it was incontestably clear that this band deserved accolades of the highest order. Their latest, Cuatro Caminos, is one of the best albums. (That sentence was not missing a clause or specification.)Although the band sprang to life from the same movement that spawned Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Maldita Vecindad, most of the guitar lines on Cuatro Caminos are spiraling, elegiac edges that sound like vintage Pavement and Calexico. ""Cero y Uno"" introduces this tone, but things don't heat up till the simmering hootenanny ""Eo""-- a euphoric approximation of The Clash's ""Brand New Cadillac"" if it spat up sound effects and circus music atop dense polyrhythms in a Vegas sex shop. But Café Tacuba play two minutes of it and get out, switching instead to ""Mediodía"". The song fully captures the expressive elasticity of frontman Élfego Buendía's voice, which can be abrasively mocking and tender in the same utterance, converting every punk song into a ballad and vice-versa. A sea shanty that swells to incorporate chimes and orchestration amidst the cracking and murmuring of the floorboards, ""Mediodía"" is a lamenting dirge that never begins to approach melodrama. ""Qué Pasará"" creates a sort of ska-metal that sounds far better than my term for it. I'm not going to deceive anyone; there's a lot of ska here. But even The Clash had to play a few reggae songs now and then, and this ain't your father's third-wave; ""Recuerdo Prestado"" is a menacing bounce that erodes into a catastrophe of a solo.There are two startling Indian-influenced breaks on the album (both of which, yes, employ tape loops and backwards guitars). The first is the chorus to ""Camino y Vereda""; the second is the Irish-Indian folksong ""Hola Adiós"" (the name is a clear allusion to ""Hello Goodbye""). ""Eres"" is unabashedly classic 70s rock, a sun-splattered villa with the best Spanish guitar line in a rock song since Naked Raygun's ""Vanilla Blue"". The epic centerpiece, ""Encantamiento IxFAtil"", begins with sparse, echoing piano and plaintive humming before Joselo Rangel unleashes a cuttingly frosty guitar line that, by itself, eclipses most of the last Godspeed album. Indeed, Café Tacuba is a band that fully acknowledges its debt to other musical legacies while remaining true to their own wholly unique vision.There are undoubtedly a few problems, or a potential for problems, on the album. ""Puntos Cardinales"" bends terrifyingly close to bad Björk territory, but is salvaged when the chorus turns into the strangest disco hit never to come out of 1979, and ""Soy o Estoy"" is too insignificant and cute to matter in the company of the rest of these songs. The album's not terribly coherent, either, as a result of its diversity-- there are songs on here that make little to no sense upon first listen (""Tomar el Fresco,"" ""Eo""), but rarely any moment at which this iconoclasm undermines the group's melodiousness. Yet, despite its minor flaws, Cuatro Caminos ranks among the most innovative and soulful full-lengths to see release this year, the rare albums on which a fantastically popular group with a firm grasp of their direction and sound is able to produce some of their most memorable and mesmerizing songs without sacrificing any of their experimentation and audacity."

Håstad is better known as the zeitgeist-chasing rapper Yung Lean, but it’s easy to imagine why a young white artist might not want to commit to decades of making music under a debatably insensitive stage moniker that celebrates the very substance to which he was once addicted. And while Håstad has cultivated a surprisingly devoted audience with his depressive cloud rap, to judge from his most recent Yung Lean release, November’s pulseless Poison Ivy, it sure doesn’t sound like his heart is in it anymore.It’s always dangerous to read too much into publicity material, but it’s no accident that the press release for Jonatan Leandoer127’s Nectar doesn’t mention Yung Lean once (instead it just conspicuously refers to Håstad as a “Stockholm-based multi-disciplinary artist.”) Pitched somewhere between King Krule’s gothic art rock and the narcoleptic folk of Beck’s early lo-fi projects, the album plays to an indie audience that’d likely never give the time of day to an artist named Yung Lean. The distance is impressive: Nectar is every bit as dazed as his rap music, while otherwise sounding almost nothing like it. Håstad’s groggy monotone and alienated wordplay are the only binding threads.Removed from the rack-stacking rap clichés he was always too quick to default to as Yung Lean, it’s easier to appreciate how compelling some of his more original prose can be. On “My Guardian” he paints a horrible vision: “Who’s the man with the sapphire eyes/Who used to watch me in my room late at night?/With spider arms, black teeth and lice/He made me wanna kill ’em all somehow.” Delivered with the nonchalance of a beat poet, his free-form prose scrambles figments of memories, dreams, and traumas.The more refined musical backdrop hasn’t made Håstad’s delivery any more ingratiating, however. His singing is a lot like his rapping: hollow and half-committal. Opener “Razor Love” sets him against flattering splashes of New Romantic saxophone, but his flat voice undercuts any emotion. He may be trying to conjure an air of Lou Reed’s detached cool, but in execution, he sounds more like G. Love singing his shopping list into a voice memo.Despite its icy posture, Nectar stacks two crowdpleaders back-to-back. With its rousing, Art Brut-caliber riff, the rocker “Off With Their Heads” is such fun that even the normally poker-faced Håstad can’t suppress a smirk, while “Wooden Girl” has the majestic twirl of the Cure’ss brightest pop singles. And “Tangerine Warrior (Freestyle),” while not a freestyle in the traditional sense, beautifully frames Håstad spit-balled poetry with an impulsive accompaniment of Neutral Milk Hotel trumpets and somber piano: “I walk around and I shine with no rhinestones/There’s no life in my eyes there’s just ice stones/When I remember my grandma in a nightgown.”Even when he seems to be sleepwalking his way through these performances, his sentiments stick and his melodies linger in the head the way his Yung Lean material rarely does. Is Jonatan Leondoer127 a lark or a reinvention? There’s enough inspiration on display to suggest that, should he ever be so inclined, Håstad really could go ahead and quit his day job."

Maybe it's because the Strokes only seem to have one influence. (Don't bother the pomo collage known as ""influences"" on the friendly AMG cheat-sheet, by the way.) But anyone with a cool uncle, or anything beyond a radioland interest in music, has listened to the Velvets. Many, many people have attempted to imitate them before, and many more will do it in the future. It's a moot point.The Still don't sound like the Velvet Underground. Well, kind of. They have the garage-chic veneer, the occasional Cale-like passages of pure sound, and the melancholy sneers of a conflicted songwriter. It's a comparison that gets tossed around from time to time, and one that should come as no surprise to bandmembers Alex Hacker, Doug Bailey and Greg Pavlovcak, even if it's not 100% accurate.But let's do a little background work: after Hacker's departure from the Ropers in 1996, the once-Slumberland darlings released an album with drummer Mike Donovan, and then promptly disbanded. The Still is basically a reformation of the Ropers, and it follows the letter of the day-- it's more mature and colored, and its songwriting is less willfully ""pop"" than before. They've even signed to a new label: Trevor Holland's pulCec.Nectar is the first result of the Ropers' maturation, and it takes every opportunity to genuflect to the band's various influences, which draw primarily from wistful shoegazer and shameless mid-90s Britpop. The opener, ""Sunshine,"" is a reluctant ""Seagull,"" only Doug Bailey's vocals crackle above a shoddy mix of Echo and the Bunnymen strings and descending basslines. His voice is singularly unfit for the largeness of the mix-- though Amy Domingues theoretically doubles the lower frequency output on cello, Bailey always comes off weak and without inflection.Further play only proves this point as a dominant issue, as borderline badass guitar lines like the one on ""Wavelength"" are castrated by Bailey's shy-guy-turned-rock-star act. This kind of posturing might be fine for the scratch vocals and okay for rehearsals, but it's unforgivable in the studio and an act of treason live. Let's hope Bailey takes a few shots of his namesake before going under the lights. That might be a good show.What's sad is that most of these songs are great, but overshadowed by blatant flaws. The exception is ""Ready Now,"" a track which simply begs to give the Strokes a run. The extra ten seconds spent on production and songwriting really here show through, uplifting the already delicious pop goodness. The Spacemen 3-ish melody and sentiments of ""Turned Around,"" however, aren't so lucky. While potentially expansive, they unfortunately surrender to mediocrity with rushed phrasing, keys pushed too far back, and endless distortion which strip the song of its poignancy. All this, of course, points to Trevor Holland, whose lo-fi aesthetics work for bands whose main strengths are unity and the desire to do things a bit dirty. The Still, though, don't need to fit the mold of modern primitivism, as their VU view came through an English mirror-- a lovely, pastoral mega-multitrack recording would serve them where their current make-up doesn't.The problem is the Still are too caught up in idol-worship with their eyes on the highest indie pop prize: Strokes-ification. Their songwriting, instrumental bravado, and dreams far outmatch their production and singer. The future will hold one or more of the following: a) Bailey will get the balls to finally front the band; b) the Still will hire a new singer; or c) the band will take a ripened, less reactionary stance and enjoy a renewed opportunity for Bailey to set the vocals right. Or, of course, they may just go down as another unrecognized band who kinda sounds like the Velvet Underground. If that turns out to be the case... next, please."

Today, Sangaré is an elder stateswoman of Malian music, in particular the updated pop descendants of the traditional hunting songs of the Wassoulou region. She is immensely popular in her homeland-- her 1989 debut album, Moussoulou (""Women""), sold an astonishing 250,000 official copies, mostly in Africa, where bootleg cassettes account for an enormous percentage of sales. She's earned her place among West Africa's musical elite, and Seya should solidify her place abroad as well, with its seamless mix of old and new sounds that give her an arresting, sometimes haunting backdrop for her confident vocals and activist lyrics, sung in several languages.Sangaré gets a hand from a whopping 47 collaborators on the album, including master guitarist Djelimady Tounkara, Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and Tony Allen. Most appear on a track or two, and mixed in with all the electric guitar, bass, flute, sax, and trap drums are a host of traditional Malian instruments, including the ngoni (a cousin of the guitar and banjo), the balafon (a type of marimba), and an arsenal of drums and percussion that give the album a diverse and always interesting rhythmic base. It opens with a blast of rhythmic balafon and dives into a fractured groove topped with an arcing flute, as Sangaré sings a forceful appeal for women's equality in society and the home. Women's rights are an issue she's built her public life and much of her music around, and it's a theme that crops up across the album.""Wele Wele Wintou"" sets dark female harmonies against a sharp sax theme behind Sangaré's rapid-fire vocal, which speaks out against forced marriage. Subtle wah guitar burbles through the verses, and Tounkara takes one of the most unusual solos I've heard, playing far down the neck with a dark, blunt tone. You could probably listen to just the instrumental backing tracks to most of these songs and come away satisfied by the richness of the interlocking rhythms and the subtle harmonic shifts. Even slow tracks like ""Senkele Te Sira"", which features another brilliant guitar part from Tounkara, have a dynamic, vibrant character that perfectly matches Sangaré's sometimes towering vocals. She knows how to accent a phrase, unleashing a powerful wail at key moments to drive home a thought in a way that makes her passion clear in any language."

Drake is still trying to balance fame, intimacy, ambition, and insecurity, and he’s still learning who to trust—it’s always trust with Drake—but there’s a malaise that lingers across his sixth album, as if Drake has lost himself in the Library of Drake, less sure where he’s supposed to devote his attention while an emptiness creeps into his life and lifestyle.The labored environment of Certified Lover Boy is a mild surprise after the album’s quick and billboard-heavy rollout. While apparent rival Kanye West took a month and a half to release Donda, darkening the project a bit more with each preview, Drake announced and released his album in the span of a week and played coy, ultimately sharing no singles and letting Tidal’s chief content officer serve as hype man, a role that included confirming the album artwork, world-famous con artist Damien Hirst’s immaculate conception of 12 pregnant women emoji placed on a stark white background. The cover is puerile and the strangest in his discography, as if he wanted to reach an iconographic nadir before his popularity waned, a wink that he can create seismic social ripples with just an iOS keyboard. In that way, the Hirst cover suggested a levity and even self-effacing irony that is not found on the album.At various points on Certified Lover Boy, it feels like Drake is trapped in the empire he’s built and the narrator-character he’s created. Luxury and pettiness, common Drake themes, are persistent across the album and it frequently sounds like he’s tired of both. On “In the Bible,” he’s with a group of women who are taking shots at the Tao Nightclub in Las Vegas and murmurs, “You don’t know love, you don’t love me like my child.” Later, on “Pipe Down,” he sings, “How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down?” He’s not pining for a simpler life or even his own past, the way he might have on 2013’s Nothing Was the Same or 2016’s Views, but just something to enjoy, something to appreciate, a greater raison d’être than another trip on Air Drake with limitless tequila—seriously, he sounds forlorn when he repeats, “Lotta ’42 on the flights I’m takin’,” on the Jay-Z collaboration “Love All.”"

Named after the 1982 album by local first-wave punk legends the Forgotten Rebels, This Ain’t Hollywood was everything you could want in a scuzzy rock’n’roll dive: Seventies B movies showing on a bank of old TV sets behind the bar, piss-stenched bathrooms covered in Sharpie and band stickers, and a psychedelic Johnny Cash painting gazing upon the room like some all-seeing eye. Since forming in 2010, TV Freaks have effectively served as This Aint’s unofficial house band, brandishing a manic style of Stooges-spiked hardcore that embodied both the gritty edge and welcoming, misfit-clubhouse vibe of the space. But while the sight of venues closing has become all too common in the COVID era, the writing was on the wall for This Ain’t Hollywood long before the pandemic hit. The building was initially put up for sale in 2018, a circumstance that speaks to another invisible force affecting urban music scenes: the market-driven transformation of once grungy corners into prime real estate.People is TV Freaks’ first proper album in five years, and while it was made well before This Ain’t Hollywood announced its closure this past spring, it’s a fitting—and necessary—progression for a band that can’t go home again. On the surface, People doesn’t appear to be a concerted effort to break overground; it was recorded live off the floor by frontman Dave O’Connor at a home studio in a single weekend. (Like 2015’s Bad Luck Charms, it was mastered by Aussie DIY demigod Mikey Young, of Eddy Current Suppression Ring and Total Control). But while the opening “Destined for Stardom” seems to mock the very idea of swinging for the fences, the song’s sudden transformation from a staccato stomp to a dance-punk sprint suggests that if TV Freaks aren’t about to conform, they’re at least willing to contort.Growing up within garage punk is often a fool’s errand that requires bands to adopt the very qualities—sing-along melodies, classic-rock conventions, modern production touches—that are antithetical to the genre’s primal essence. But on People, TV Freaks pull off the uncommon trick of making themselves more accessible without sounding any less irascible. In the past, O’Connor often had to bark himself hoarse in order to be heard above guitarist TJ Charlton’s in-the-red riffs, Vivenne Bell Bright’s pugilistic basslines, and drummer Nathan Burger’s double-timed gallop, but the repressed flamboyance and trembling distress in his voice belied his imposing aggression. He has explored those qualities more freely in the new-wave goth-soul serenades of his solo alias, Sweet Dave, but on People, TV Freaks take full advantage of his violent-to-vulnerable range."

Drake & Tems),0.0,1.0,1.0,0.314,afro-latin,6.0,"Stymied by formulaic collaborations and unmemorable beats, the rapper’s latest has the ingredients of a really good Future album but lacks the depth of one.","“Toxic” is both the best and worst thing to happen to Future. Over the course of his immortal four-project run in the mid-2010s—Monster, Beast Mode, 56 Nights, and Dirty Sprite 2—the word became the defining trait of his persona. As he emerged as one of rap’s biggest superstars, it was like his conscience was telling him one thing and his masculinity another. But “toxic” also flattened the emotional complexity and thoughtfulness of Future’s songwriting. He wrote brooding sagas about self-inflicted heartbreak; candid reflections on the drugs that he blamed for his pain and relied on to heal it, too; turn-up joints about a life of luxury layered with the sense that he was overcompensating for lost love. Often on these tapes, he could go through all those feelings in one verse, blurring reality and myth.But since then, despite some great moments—specifically 2017’s HNDRXX—Future has increasingly become a caricature of himself. His writing started to feel one-dimensional, embellishing the Future persona with even more devious lines. His stories used to contain mistakes and melodrama, but lately it feels like the goal is to get one over on the women he sings about. His latest album I Never Liked You—the title sounds like a breakup note passed in the back of a middle-school classroom—has the ingredients of a really good Future album but lacks the depth of one. It plays it safe by continuing to lean too hard on the schtick.Still, Future is such a slick rapper and vocalist that his songs are pretty fun even when the lyrics feel routine. “I’m Dat Nigga” introduces a bunch of subtle yet exciting change-ups to his flow: He accelerates for a couplet, slows down for the next, and by the end, he’s in full boastful monologue mode. The eeriness of “Puffin on Zootiez” might make you believe Future is saying more than he actually is, but it’s OK because his downbeat yet rapid delivery and the ornate instrumental carry the song. The repetitive but memorable “Chickens” is a highlight, as Future embraces the cartoonish side of his character and gets a fresh burst of energy from EST Gee’s menace.But Gee is the only collaboration on the album that feels inspired; the others are so formulaic that they’re indistinguishable. Check “Wait For U” with Drake: Sampling Tems’ “Higher” is a cheat code to a catchy song, but Future and Drake are on such autopilot that I’d rather listen to the original. The other joint with Drake, “I’m on One,” wouldn’t have even made the cut for What a Time to Be Alive. “For a Nut,” with Young Thug and Gunna, is the bottom of the barrel. The song is supposed to be a sleazy, darkly funny good time, but the lyrics are so half-assed that they come off more like a parody."

Amazingly, he also managed to make these records formal challenges to fixed ideas about culture and genre. And at the time, the Family Stone's seven albums-- now boxed in a purple paisley time capsule from Epic/Legacy (as well as available separately), complete with obligatory remastering job, new liner notes, plenty of period photos, and of course bonus tracks-- were released, his message (""we are family,"" essentially) couldn't have been needed more urgently. When the Family Stone released Stand! in 1969, images of lynching trees (Medgar Evers had taken a bullet only six years before, and Malcolm X two years after that), fire hoses turned on freedom marchers (Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy dead less than a year), and soldiers in flag-draped coffins (30,000 Americans killed in Southeast Asia by May 1969) were present tense for Sly, and for his audience. We also live in troubled times, to be sure, and it's perverse to compare body counts in very different wars. But a cynic might argue that we'd need to have a modern day leader like King or Kennedy before we would need someone to articulate their loss.If no one thinks they can change the world anymore-- and personally, I think that's bullshit-- it's because our expectations have been turned to mush, until people my age are almost born suspicious and resigned. It's been 36 years since Sly released There's a Riot Goin On, his masterpiece, and that's a lot of time for cynicism to build up like a blood clot or a fat blockage. Television has led me to believe that when the Family Stone were new, folks actively believed they were gonna paint psychedelic flowers on the citadels of power, and it made Sly's fusion of rock and r&b more than a post-modern exercise in mixing styles and his in-yer-face integrationist aesthetic vital to his audience in a way that's probably hard to take 100% seriously when you're experiencing ""the 60s"" through black-and-white photographs of marches and atrocities in 10th-grade history textbooks. And if you want a potted pop history of the changing musical and social mores of the 1960s, The Collection is better than 100 History Channel (or VH1) documentaries combined. Just look at the album covers and interior photos: On 1967's A Whole New Thing, despite the pink shirts of his bandmates, saxophonist Jerry Martini is still wearing a sensible brown blazer to go with his (eww) socks and sandals. By 69's Stand! he's dressed in something that seems to cross The Sword in the Stone with Easy Rider, even if he still kind of looks like Rip Torn has wandered into a production of Hair."

It’s as if he was chosen by a higher power to speak for everyone who has been through some shit. His stories—sometimes centered on a poverty-stricken upbringing that led to a life full of death and addiction, other times focused on self-inflicted heartbreak—are personal but tend to be universal. Yeah, there are a lot of singing rappers in a similar lane, but Durk stands out because of his bruised wailing and lyrics so specific that they have to be based on some truth.His latest album, 7220, is more of the same. Working within a framework isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but there are cracks in the formula. Mostly on the production side, which is incredibly played out. Since 2018’s Signed to the Streets 3, Durk has leaned into the trend of mushy keys with a ’90s R&B ballad feel. It’s not that good albums haven’t been made with this production style as the foundation (see: Polo G’s Die a Legend) but there is a uniform cheapness to them that doesn’t work when you use them time after time.Still, even with the stale sound of the album, Durk is such a complex and colorful writer that it’s worth it to stick it out. The appeal is in his details. My criticism of a few of the other hugely popular rappers who croon about their pain is that they tell us they’re hurting without actually describing why. Durk doesn’t have that issue. He can flesh out an entire scene with one bar. On “Headtaps,” what’s getting him down is more than being in jail, it’s missing out on small moments with his kids like watching Peppa Pig. Or on “Started From,” in which he remembers being so broke that he went over to his neighbors with a water jug to keep the bill manageable.But unlike, say, a Rod Wave album, Durk’s 7220 isn’t all gut punches. Since 2017’s Love Songs For the Streets, he’s been a part-time toxic relationship guru. It’s a mess every time, but on occasion, the over-the-top melodrama of it all is pretty fun. Just check out “Blocklist” where he’s pretty much on his knees coming up with bullshit reasons for his ex to keep in touch with him: She made him cry once, he gives her an allowance, he answers the phone whenever she calls. Not very convincing! The same can be said for his duet with Summer Walker—which has a few of the album’s more interesting vocal refrains (too often he coasts on one note)—even though I was disturbed by him setting the mood with Justin Bieber’s “Yummy.”It’s worth it to note that these two tracks aren’t really intended to be fun; conversely, the two sleazy duets that are meant to be fun I find less so. “Petty Too” continues this tiring viral-chasing run of Future features. Then the Morgan Wallen two-hander is forced, with Durk attempting to widen the appeal of his lyrics with references to riding bulls and horses and P!nk and Ed Sheeran name-drops. C’mon now, that’s not him. Lil Durk has become a huge star because of lyrics that focus in, instead of zoom out. For the most part, 7220 gets that."

Their Overseas is a live album, though it's not done in one live take: they strung together performances to build an exceptionally cohesive collection.","It is a staggering task—one that would take several hours—to listen through the recorded output of Edwin and Andy White. The two brothers, Florida-raised and currently Brooklyn-based, have released an alarmingly unwieldy pile of music over the past few years. Edwin makes records under the name Eola, and his last album Ye features elaborate, dramatic choral arrangements where he's the sole vocalist. Andy's records as Andy Boay are psychedelic and unpredictable—he creates cluttered, maximal song structures that can shift suddenly from ethereal to heavy. Together, they're Tonstartssbandht (pronounced tahn-starts-bandit), an endlessly touring project that's always been eclectic.For the majority's of the band's lifespan, the two brothers have lived apart—Andy in Montreal, Ed in New York—so their records came together during brief stints of in-person collaboration and, as Andy said, through ""a ton of emailing, megauploading, and mediafiring songs to each other."" The resulting records aren't easily definable by a long shot. ""Our style of music definitely goes all over,"" Edwin told Interview, and he's right: vocal experiments stilted by tape effects, echoing tracks that are more reminiscent of straightforward rock'n'roll—you could spend the better part of a day cataloging this band's many disparate sounds. But regardless of where you hit play on any of their 24 solo and collective Bandcamp albums, you'll find two talented musicians self-recording an enormous pile of ambitious music.Still, the best way to experience Tonstartssbandht isn't by clicking around their various releases—it's to hear what the two brothers create in a live setting. In addition to being an accomplished vocalist, Edwin is an incredible drummer. Andy creates an enormous, lush sound with his 12-string Danelectro. As a duo, they go long for stretches of music that's easily described as psychedelic, though nothing's bleary or incomprehensible. Everything they perform seems just slightly hazy and out of reach. They're jammy, but never loose or sloppy, and they can shift suddenly from expansive Tuareg-style guitar odysseys into full-on proto-punk bashing. Their vocals mesh together in this way where at first, it's difficult to parse whether it's two people singing in perfect unison or just an echo effect. Eventually, their voices dart in separate directions, finding harmonies that aren't always intuitive, but work perfectly. Everything is porous and fluid.That's why Overseas is, perhaps, the best Tonstartssbandht document to date—it's a live album, though it's not done in one live take. Much like how Ed collaged together a series of letters and words to come up with the band's name, the duo strung together multiple performances to build an exceptionally cohesive record. These are recordings culled from shows at Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, Newcastle, and other cities overseas. Clearly, this band thrives in ""collage"" mode, as the album's tracklist is built largely from a steady stream of medleys. They seem to trim songs down to their most essential elements, riding into battle together with an abridged (but no less powerful) rendition of the heavy psych jam ""First Taape"". That howling basher from Andy's old band Sugar Boys is pared back to two minutes from 17:12. They slowly fade into ""Last Time"", a sparse, echoing interpretation of the Rolling Stones track."

Rapping entirely in ad-libs, hooks, and Instagram-ready one-liners, he sounded like a kid raised on a strict diet of Get Rich or Die Tryin’, Finally Rich, and Newports. His production, mostly from UK drill beat wizard 808Melo, mixed grimy, fast-paced drums with vocal samples ripped from UK garage and melodies that could score an anime. This stew of influences could only come from an artist raised on the internet, but Pop Smoke’s smooth arrogance and West Indian lingo remains distinctly Brooklyn. Now that “Welcome to the Party” is his borough's current summer anthem, he capitalizes on the momentum with his debut mixtape Meet the Woo.Meet the Woo arrives at a pivotal moment for Brooklyn’s still-growing drill scene. Ever since 22Gz’s “Suburban” and Sheff G’s “No Suburban,” Brooklyn drill has lingered in the shadows of its Chicago and UK counterparts. Even as 22Gz signed to Kodak Black’s Sniper Gang and Sheff G became a phenomenon in New York City high schools, the prevailing theory was that these guys would never break out of the Northeast unless they switched up their style. Meet the Woo doesn’t overthink this dilemma; it’s just Pop Smoke taking nine swings at making the hardest, dirtiest shit he possibly can.Previous singles “Meet the Woo” and “Welcome to the Party” lead off the mixtape and set its sinister tone. Of the new tracks, “Scenario” comes closest to recreating their magic: Pop Smoke’s voice is harrowing and Marvel-supervillain worthy, the beat a haunted amusement park. He doesn’t show a lot of lyrical creativity, but he can catch you off guard with his delivery: On “Better Have Your Gun,” he goes from ignorant bravado—“Shoot a nigga, go to jail for it/Cause I know I got the bail for it”—to demented and playful, whispering designer brands with a nightmarish echo on his voice.  His limitations as a writer are exposed on “Dior”—outside of the mesmerizing hook, which doubles as an Amiri Jeans ad, he sounds stuck, repurposing lines like “Bitch I’ma thot get me lit” and throwing in a lazy and unneccesary and homophobic one-liner.It might be occasionally unimaginative, but overall Meet the Woo injects life into a Brooklyn drill scene that was running on fumes. Pop Smoke just wants to cause chaos and dominate the playlists of every party before the NYPD inevitably shuts them down. He’s already accomplished this feat with “Welcome to the Party,” and something on this mixtape will follow in its footsteps soon. Maybe a Brooklyn drill rapper can break through without changing, after all."

Millions of clicks later in 2019, Sheff G is still something of an underdog: Unluccy Luccy Kid comes after Canarsie’s Pop Smoke took over the summer with “Welcome to the Party.” The spotlight’s redirection hasn’t deterred Sheff, though. The production here is cleaner, but his debut project finds him repacking his style instead of making large steps forward.The Unluccy Luccy Kid feels more like an industry necessity than a statement. A few of its tracks can stick out on their own, like the previously released “Flows,” his bluesy collaboration with fellow Brooklynite Sleepy Hallow. But strung together, these tracks are dulled by their own repetitiveness. You’ve heard all these grievances elsewhere: We came from the struggle, don’t like fake love or snitches, and don’t pretend you shot somebody, just be yourself.Sheff G largely avoids the introspection or detail that would give these tropes weight. He broods about being “a product of power and pain” over the funereal pianos of “Respect,” but his verses are pridefully elliptical about what that means: “Never talked what I did/Still I will never talk what I saw.” To be fair, that’s not really anybody’s business; however, Mozzy’s vivid verse on the ghostly “Menace” (“Meet me on Fourth, right by the court/None of these shooting guards play around”) has more resonance.Sheff G largely relies on the compact, off-beat syllabic barrages that he rode on “No Suburban.” His approach works best when he’s not trying to contort that flow into singsong melodies, like the clumsy and generic “Designer.” Sleepy Hallow appears on half of the project’s tracks and does well as the choleric foil to Sheff’s bearish presence, landing many of the album’s darkest jabs (“What can they tell me about the trenches, almost lost my sense/So if my name is ever mentioned just tell the judge send a sentence,” he raps on “All My Life,” darkly humorous but dead serious).The Unluccy Luccy Kid isn’t going to be the groundbreaker that pops the Brooklyn drill scene out of its bubble, but that’s probably how it was designed. Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow sound more engaged when they’re rapping unapologetically about street dealings. A few of drill’s artists have expressed making music mainly for the folks who walked those streets. If Unluccy Luccy Kid connects with them, hasn’t it served its purpose?"

He didn’t believe it was real until he hopped out of bed and bolted to his dad’s house to show him the text. Shiesty wasn’t flooding the streets with mixtapes—Gucci had only heard one song of his: the Tay Keith-produced “Main Slime.” But here Gucci Mane was, reaching out with the intent to sign him to the New 1017.Shiesty made his formal introduction on the label compilation Gucci Mane Presents: So Icy Summer, with immediate standouts “7.62 God” and “Monday to Sunday.” It was clear that Pooh Shiesty was the best in his recruiting class, but a solo record was nowhere in sight. After months of anticipation, the Memphis rapper finally tries his hand at a full-length project with Shiesty Season.Pooh Shiesty has proven himself to be a supercharged battery on singles, and the massively front-loaded Shiesty Season doesn’t give you a chance to forget that. The opening one-two punch of “Shiesty Season Intro” and “Back in Blood” sets a high bar to clear for the remaining 15 tracks. Pooh and Lil Durk form an Edge & Christian-level tag team on the latter. The combination of a looped piano scale and drums on “Back in Blood” makes for one of the album’s simplest yet most memorable beats. “Yeah, you know who took that shit from you/Come get it back in blood,” Pooh Shiesty taunts, punctuating the line with his signature “blrrrd” adlib. Durk doesn’t just match Shiesty’s bravado—the Chicago rapper takes complete control. “His ass playin’, bitch I’m really icy/Pooh Shiesty that’s my dawg, but Pooh, you know I’m really shiesty,” Durk smugly raps. “Back in Blood” was far from unknown when it was originally released in November, but the music video tossed gas onto the flames, making it his first Billboard charting single and No. 1 on Apple Music Charts after passing “the license girl.”Apart from Durk, Shiesty stands his ground when sparring against big-name features like his label boss and 21 Savage. The down-tempo “Box of Churches” is a surprising mid-album highlight where he reflects on his come-up and refusal to let go of what puts him at ease. “Know I’m a hood nigga, I mismatch designer with the J’s,” he raps. “Though I’m still posted on the block, eat a box of Church’s before a steak.” He goes right back to talking shit with Veeze and frequent collaborator BIG30 on the following track. Veeze and Pooh may sound like they’re in a competition to see who can lean back the furthest in a recliner while murmuring threats over the brassy fanfare, but their love of wordplay (and gunplay) keep your head nodding."

And that's moodier, louder, more atmospheric.","Cults' name has always suited them well—the out-of-Bandcamp-nowhere ubiquity of the New York duo's ""Go Outside"", still a fixture in TV commercials, had all the hallmarks of a cult success. It also samples a cult leader, but Cults drew thematically on various ideas related to its nominal subject: romance as kidnapping, a band as a cult-like escape from the rest of the world's expectations.Except Cults' songs never sounded like they belonged to a niche audience. Despite a slight lo-fi haze, their bittersweet collage of 1960s girl-group elements, 21st-century production techniques, and direct, inventive songcraft was almost as distinctive on arrival as near-contemporaries Sleigh Bells' Bubble-Yum blasts. But Cults weren't even abrasive. They could be fuck-you blunt, their spoken-word samples were potentially off-putting, and even their sweetest teen-angel prom dances had devilish undercurrents. But particularly on a song like ""Bumper"", a masterful breakup-scene duet, their potential for converts seemed limitless.Static is more cult-like than Cults. Released after extensive touring, Cults' sophomore album sidesteps presumptions about a rising, major-label band and admirably finds contentment not in what they could be, but what they are right now. And that's moodier, louder, more atmospheric. Multi-instrumentalist Brian Oblivion and singer Madeline Follin again co-produced the album with early Vampire Weekend engineer Shane Stoneback, but this time they got heavy-hitter help from Ben Allen, the former Gnarls Barkley producer whose more recent clients include Animal Collective, Deerhunter, Washed Out, and Youth Lagoon. Static deepens Cults' sound, but the song probably won't spread as far, or as quickly.Glockenspiel is (mostly) out; 60s and 70s film-score bombast is in, befitting the band members' film-school backgrounds. Shaft-infused orchestral skull-cracker ""High Road"" evokes cinematic James Mercer-Danger Mouse project Broken Bells in more than song title; one-minute reverie ""TV Dream"" hurtles after sci-fi theremin. Also in, by the way, is static itself. Recalling the all-silver-everything studios that produced LCD Soundsystem's 2007 masterpiece Sound of Silver, Cults have said they'd wheel broken TVs into the room while making the album. A fittingly frazzled guitar shrieks midthrough the galloping, organ-bummed, banjo-folked ""We've Got It"". White noise delicately coats sighing opener ""I Know"" and piano-centered finale ""No Hope"", which tests out a newly Beach House-like duskiness in Follin's vocals, amid gorgeously, brutally depressive lyrics.""Static"" can also mean staying in one place, of course. With Follin's words buried a bit more in the cacophony, and a relative lack of standout songs compared to the debut's treasure trove, that's also relevant here. First advance track ""I Can Hardly Make You Mine"", with whirring live-band propulsion and a convincing romantic desperation, is by far the poppiest song. Stasis occasionally comes up in the lyrics, too, as on the locket-pocket swayer ""Always Forever"", which sends Follin's voice to unusually pinched heights, or blurrily loping ""Shine a Light"", where all her narrator wants is ""to keep you here forever."" On ""No Hope"", we're told to ""forget tomorrow."""

Rich the Kid, a demonstrable talent with his own imprint (Rich Forever) rode into the mainstream on a wave of critical enthusiasm and industry interest atop “New Freezer.” That it includes the holy grail of features from Kendrick Lamar suggested that, yeah, Rich’s made it, but the album that came with the explosive single rarely shifts out of a default rap scheme.While the Rich the Kid we meet on The World Is Yours clearly considers himself a big-leaguer, the album is short on the deftness and polish that was promised on “New Freezer.” He ably deploys the standard stop-and-go triplet flow across its 14 tracks, but does so without ever shifting from a self-limiting rap model, leaning heavily on concussive, bass-heavy beats and lyrical contributions from a bounty of veteran and trend-setting artists.The title track is a comparatively honest introduction, lacking in the “yuhs” and “ayys” that soon begin to overwhelm and distract. “World Is Yours” lays out the devil-may-care posturing and slight bits of humor (“No Biggie but I used to trap in the Coogi”) that listeners should expect for the next 40-plus minutes. The clarity of the leadoff bleeds into the glut of trap motifs that is “New Freezer,” wherein Rich gladly ingratiates himself with the album’s talking points: money, women, cars, and big jewelry.Rich shows off his lyrical styling, but even that remains far from revelatory. While his voice suffuses the album, it exhibits only a handful of emotional states. For Rich, who has noted that he does not write his bars down, but rather, “I just go in there and—boom,” his enthusiasm doesn’t make up for his lack of styles and flows. His insistence on rapping about “money, hoes, and clothes” as Biggie waxed 23 years ago puts Rich in a position to get consistently outshone by the many co-signs scattered across the album.This is pointedly clear on “End of Discussion,”a dismissal of perceived haters that is piqued by a curious beeping sound and the noise of a money-counting machine at work. Lil Wayne does the heavy lifting here with a bodied rollout of well-paced, self-referential rhymes: “Pull of fast like a loose cheetah/One diamond ring on two fingers/Cheating on these hoes, call me Tune-cheater.” He sounds as if he were running a clinic on the song; a rap alum at homecoming mingling with the popular freshman. Meanwhile, Rich is somewhat adrift in his unremarkable feints. It makes the notable absence of female voices significant as woman contribute little to the album save as unnamed dalliances, anonymous tricks, and forget-me-nots."

He raps in a needling whine about gunfights and authority and the spaces where they intersect: neighborhood turf wars, exchanges with law enforcement, being strapped as a symbol of manhood, and using gunmanship as a means to gain control over one’s own life, to overcome poverty and unbalanced systems. Last year, he released his most compelling work yet, Young Jefe 2, a blueprint for his particular brand of confessional tough talk, half chest-beating bravado, half emotional plea for understanding (“I promise you that you gon’ feel my pain bitch”). The tape was the most comfortable he’s ever been, proudly taking up the mantle of local street benefactor and willing brand ambassador for his crew. Perhaps sensing a shift, King has dropped the Shy Glizzy moniker in favor of the mixtape persona: Jefe, which is Spanish for ‘boss.’ “I’m just rebranding myself. Reinventing on a whole higher level,” he told the Fader. “I earned the title Jefe ... From the get go I’ve been putting on for the city.”His first offering under the new name is an EP called The World Is Yours. The eight-track project continues to explore the same ongoing themes in King’s music—using success as a window through which to reflect on humbler beginnings. Its message is encapsulated in the hook on “Love Me”: “How the fuck could you hate me when I came up from nothing?/I just want you to love me.”This isn’t King at the peak of his powers. When he’s at his best, he can string several devastating phrases together to create complex models of what he’s seeing and feeling. Here, he mostly seems content to roll leisurely through verses, as on “Over the Hills.” There’s no sense of urgency, and, outside of declaring his city a war zone, the stakes are generally lower for Jefe than they are in most Shy Glizzy songs. But that doesn’t mean the songs are without consequence. On “Congratulations,” he assesses the envy of those close to his success. The cautionary tale “Give It Up” is an instruction manual for young street soldiers, ending with an inspirational testimonial, tracing a bleak journey from juvenile corrections to six-figure tours: “14 years old, I went to juvie for an O/16 years old, I stuck my dick in my PO/18 years old, I was whipping up the dope/ By 20 years old, I was getting 20 for a show.” The World Is Yours seems as much a personal memo as it is a Nas-ian aphorism.For much of the EP’s running time, Jefe provides glimpses of what can, at times, make him a truly special rapper—as has been exhibited in the past on songs like “Funeral” and “Awwsome.” He’ll go through an entire verse only using one scheme (as he does on “Congratulations”), but other times he’ll take big cuts at syllables, at one point rhyming “fuck,” “New York,” and “Marshall Faulk.” Over one of the most vibrant Zaytoven beats in years, on “One,” he mixes off-balance slant rhymes with brief moments of criminal introspection. It’s a reminder of what he’s capable of. The World Is Yours is a fine introduction to Jefe. But it’s still worth getting to know Shy Glizzy first."

Despite a few good tracks scattered here and there, the music he's made on his own has frequently felt more obligatory than inspired, borrowing emotional audio signifiers from his proto-Britpop and placing them alongside lyrics that balance arrogance, cheap sentiment and politics too vague to count as protest. On this, his fifth solo outing (apart from a remix disc and a ""best of""), he's stuck in one gear the whole time on a set of lumbering songs oversoaked in strings, whose job seems to be to say, ""Listen to how majestic and meaningful these songs are.""He's titled the album The World Is Yours, by which he really means ""the world is mine,"" as related on the opening title track. The song begins with some noodling strings and Brown enters with the lines, ""As a young boy / Daddy used to tell me stories,"" the payoff being that his father always told him, ""the world is yours,"" and that he came to believe it. One would think that Brown would relate a few of his father's stories in the rest of the song, but he instead just strings together about a dozen dog-tired clichés while the music does the same.""Sweet Children"" centers on Brown's wish that he had a house with 10million rooms that he could open to the ""street children"" before going all Vivaldi with fluttering strings in the middle. It's great that Brown wants to save the children, but the sophomoric lyrics read like the diary entry of an 8th grade girl the night after her social studies class discussed Darfur. With the strings and choir, it also comes across as self-important in much the same way as Michael Jackson's quasi-messianic 1996 BRIT Awards performance that was famously broken up by Jarvis Cocker.Because the melodies he's come up with aren't much to write home about, most of these songs rely too heavily on hackneyed lyrics to work their way into your head. On ""Illegal Attacks,"" Brown actually addresses Iraq and Afghanistan in an unusually specific protest, but he diminishes the impact of what he's saying by using Moveon.org oversimplifications like, ""These are commercial crusades/ They used a terror charade to get paid,"" and pleading for ""soldiers [to] come home."" The song does have the msot interesting string part on the album, though, using the cellos to good rhythmic effect.All of this comes over an incredibly uniform backing. Apart from the strings, the general formula is for the live drums to be augmented with a little programming, and for little bits of keyboard to jab into the mid-tempo arrangements now and then. That's pretty much it. It sounds good-- Brown's detached, wispy/gritty voice is pleasing as ever, and I like a pop string arrangement as much as the next guy-- but it doesn't add up to much in the end. To put it another way, this is an album I wouldn't feel compelled to turn off if it was playing, but it's also not one I'd feel compelled to put on again after it finished."

It's out under his birth name and titled for his birth year, and though he's been coy about the subject, the specter of his divorce from singer Christina Milian looms over it.","1977 is-- to quote Terius Nash himself-- an ""Internet album."" Nash (aka The-Dream) released it for free on his website on August 31, with the begrudged blessing of his bosses at Def Jam. It's his fourth solo album, but his first released in this manner, and it raises the question of whether or not we are supposed to alter our expectations. Is this a tossed-off re-packaging of demos? Is he merely trying to satiate a fanbase waiting for an album that he promised to drop this past June? We don't know the answers to those questions (although my guesses would be ""no"" and ""maybe""), but it would seem foolish to hold 1977 to a lower standard. It's no longer unusual-- especially in the world of rap, and to a lesser extent R&B-- to put a full album on the Internet for free. If Nash had included a way for fans to pay what they wanted for the album, he would've been adopting a strategy utilized in previous years by Radiohead and Girl Talk.And yet, Nash is asking us to adjust our expectations. Crucially though, he's not asking that we alter our notions of what we expect of him, just what we expect from him. 1977 represents not a conscious change in quality, but a conscious change in style and sound, at least for the time being. A few days before he released the album, he tweeted, ""When I'm 40 ill write Myself a Pop Smash just so I can Perform on National TV. Not that hard to do. But that's not who I am right now."" True to his word, 1977 often strays far from Nash's few solo pop smashes. Instead, it is a deeply personal and presumably therapeutic album. It's one that he fought with his label to release, that he's putting out under his birth name and titled for his birth year, and for which he has put the lyrics of every song up on his website. Though he was predictably coy about the subject, the specter of his divorce from singer Christina Milian looms over it.In its sparseness and unrelenting directness, the album's most recent precedent is Kanye West's break up opus 808s & Heartbreak, and much like that record, it's already proven to be a divisive if misunderstood album. It showcases a bitter and angry Nash, and though he has previously dabbled in acidic and unflinching break-up songs, 1977 is his first album to largely focus on something other than his sexual prowess. Like West, his vitriol is mostly spewed outward, with seemingly little regard for the feelings or reputation of whoever is on the other side. There is Spanish guitar, as if Nash imagines himself readying for a duel. There is acoustic guitar, as if to accentuate his confessionals. And there is guitar feedback, as if his heart were screaming out."

Blige, Hope Sandoval, and Björk, among others.","It was all a matter of time: Over the past 18 years-- first with The Afghan Whigs and then as The Twilight Singers-- Greg Dulli has covered several anthologies' worth of songs on stage and on singles. Musically, Dulli is omnivorous, devouring everything from Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" to Hole's ""Miss World"" to New Order's ""Regret"" to Prince's ""When Doves Cry"". A covers album was inevitable.Reflecting Dulli's range of interest and influence, She Loves You covers a lot of territory in just 11 songs: R&B;, showtunes, classic rock, jazz, blues, soul, and Björk. For some artists, this line-up-- which includes songs by Hope Sandoval, John Coltrane, David Holmes & Martina Topley-Bird, Lindsey Buckingham, and Marvin Gaye, among others-- might appear too willful and calculated in its range of styles and genres, but Dulli's precedent-setting live performances and B-sides deflect that criticism. Diversity, however, is never an end in itself, and fortunately, The Twilight Singers evince an understanding of these songs, resulting in some intriguing interpretations. Dimming the lights and spreading them out on satin sheets beneath the mirrored ceiling, Greg Dulli-fies these songs, translating them into his particular brand of dark-end-of-the-street, soul-derived rock and, at his most brazen, altering their meanings.Unlike the four cover songs on Afghan Whigs' 1994 EP What Jail Is Like, this is no one-night stand. Rather, She Loves You treats each song differently while still being carefully sequenced so that its tracks cohere into a narrative of love and loss, resulting in a record that manages to sound as if its tracks were the product of one mind. (Although, in fairness, Dulli's musical mind was itself formed by many of these songs, which prompts a chicken-or-the-egg conundrum). The Dulli who sings the edge-of-the-precipice ""Hyperballad"", for example, could be the same one who wrote ""Be Sweet"" or ""Something Hot"".On Fleetwood Mac's ""What Makes You Think You're the One"", Dulli loses the original's regimental march tempo, allowing the song to sprawl and stretch as he mimics Lindsey Buckingham's slurred vocals. ""Too Tough to Die"" merges Topley-Bird's dark Americanisms onto a New Orleans piano shuffle, and on ""Real Love""-- first recorded by Mary J. Blige-- he builds on the jump-rope rhythms of the original, letting a sawing guitar drive the chorus. Elsewhere, the Gershwin Brothers' classic ""Summertime"" sounds new, darker. Over a 70s-soundtrack guitar flourish, Dulli sings ""hush, little baby, don't you cry"" like a sexual predator, his voice sounding pack-a-day ragged. It's sinister and not a little unnerving, but he makes it fascinating just the same, mostly because his interpretation doesn't stray from the original, just re-frames it."

As the story goes, Wilson was hanging at Studio Three West with Pet Sounds collaborator Gary Usher in the spring of 1966 when he caught snippets of a recording conducted by 21-year-old wunderkind Curt Boettcher. Boettcher, fresh from producing The Association's first record, and with something of a rare talent for soaring, angelic vocal arrangements along the lines of Wilson's very own, took Wilson and Usher by complete surprise. In fact, legend has it that Boettcher's ability to produce majestically layered instrumental and vocal pieces seemingly at the drop of a hat threw Wilson for a loop, and is rumored to have started the breakdown that would ultimately destroy his Smile project, and indeed his life ever after.Even if you don't buy the story, Boettcher's effect on L.A. pop cannot be denied. Usher would soon pull him in as a collaborator on what would later become Present Tense by Sagittarius, a psych-pop outfit whose only LP is one of the great, lost classics of ""sunshine pop."" Boettcher's other major projects in the 60s were work with his own band The Ballroom, and later, a curiously overlooked record by songwriter supergroup The Millennium. In addition to his love of exquisite harmony vocals, Boettcher's stereo productions were remarkably crisp for the time-- certainly more so that Wilson's concurrent adventures in mono. I'd say Boettcher's own songs (and that of most sunshine pop artists) usually weren't of the same depth as Wilson's, but that's another argument.The Millennium was comprised of several successful songwriters and musicians living and working in Los Angeles in the mid-60s, including Lee Mallory, Sandy Salisbury and Joey Stec. All had worked with or around Boettcher and Usher, and proved themselves capable of delivering on what would become the largest recording budget in Columbia Records' history to that point. Their result was 1968's Begin, and though it's probably the single greatest 60s pop record produced in L.A. outside of The Beach Boys, it (like Wilson's music) found itself very much outside the times that year. After Begin tanked, the band was dropped from Columbia-- setting up the perfect cult record years later. Of course, the band had planned to make many more albums, and Pieces collects demos intended for their follow-up.Anyone hip to The Millennium or other Boettcher projects might recognize many of the songs here, as they've been released before as Again, though Pieces includes many tracks that failed to make that compilation. Most importantly, almost all of these songs will be of interest to folks looking for perfect pop in the mold of The Association, Beach Boys and even into the budding country-rock of The Byrds. ""I Just Don't Know How to Say Goodbye"" is an almost perfect realization of the styles of each of those artists, though the tune and loose, gentle optimism of Salisbury's vocal give it a strength to stand on its own. The song, with rising, major-key guitar figures and a folkish bent (much of this music could have worked in a completely acoustic setting) did show up on Salisbury's 1968 solo LP."

For Thursday, this cohort appears to be smaller than most. In fact, the overwhelming consensus is that Waiting is their least potent work, an opinion that’s less uncomfortable to hold knowing that it is also Geoff Rickly’s. But that’s more a reflection on the overall strength of their catalog and how every Thursday record managed to be superlative in its own way: Full Collapse is the most influential; War All the Time the heaviest; A City by the Light Divided remains their most melodic, A Common Existence their most brutal; and No Devolución their most comprehensive. Waiting simply stands as Thursday’s most promising and earnest album.These are qualities that are granted retroactively, and the slick packaging of this reissue (including their now-iconic dove logo, which didn't actually appear until War All the Time) realigns Waiting as part of Thursday’s arc rather than an outlier. While it’s easy to appreciate because of what it led to, Waiting managed to stand out at the time because of Rickly’s passionate, verbose lyrics and near-frightening intensity. This was by far the most developed aspect of Thursday’s sound in 2000 and would continue to set them apart even as a still-healthy record industry figured out what the hell to do with them.At the time of Waiting, Thursday didn’t quite know where they stood either. The music itself is agitated, propulsive. ""Porcelain"" was inspired by the suicide of a friend and begins the record expounding on the heartbreaking fragility of life itself, contrasted with Rickly’s anger and resentment towards a society unwilling to take the smallest steps to protect those who might not be able to help themselves. Rickly also advocated for ramped-up suicide prevention measures and tighter background checks for gun buyers in the lyrics sheet.The same overwhelming frustration courses through ""Dying in New Brunswick"", perhaps the most tortured track Rickly would ever write. As with most of Waiting, it’s drawn from his own experience—his girlfriend at the time moved to the titular city and was raped within a week. Rickly tries to understand her trauma (""In these city streets I hide my face/ I turn away when you look at me/ And every night when I try to sleep/ I can feel your hands all over my body"") as well as cultural mores and legal hurdles that causes the victim to blame themselves (""They say it doesn’t happen that often/ But it’s happening right now""). The only thing the two songs share is a longing for escape, from the city, from everything—death is preferable to the liminal state of dying."

On paper, it sounds like a perfectly on-brand gesture from a band of West Coast psychedelic jammers who, even at their noisiest, always seems to be striving for tranquility through rhythmic hypnosis. But while the cover’s backdrop presents a splendorous tropical utopia straight out of an “H.R. Pufnstuf” episode, the peace sign itself is rendered as cold, cracked concrete.Perhaps it’s intended as a decaying monument to the death of ‘60s idealism, or a comment on how that era’s most incendiary protest music has fossilized into summer-barbecue soundtracks. Or perhaps it’s mourning the very notion of non-violent protest at a time when it’s become a fireable offense. Wooden Shjips have never been ones for overtly political statements; 90 percent of the time, you can barely tell what lead singer/guitarist Ripley Johnson is talking about in his smeared murmur. But if V. doesn’t exactly represent a shift toward newsticker topicality, its overall vibe—chill, yet resolute—suggests a desire to take that crumbling grey peace sign and rehabilitate it with some Poly-Fil and Day-Glo paint.Johnson has said that his goal for V. was to make a summer album—but in his case, he started writing it last year during a summer where the sun was being obscured by black clouds both figurative (the Trump administration) and literal (the fiery ash that was raining down on his home city of Portland due to the inferno consuming the nearby Columbia River Gorge). Instead, he came up with a record that’s all about savoring those fleeting moments of happiness when you can find them. Which is not to say V. is a record of passive escapism—the opening “Eclipse” marches in on a fuzz groove that suggests Suicide gone Motown, while a saxocalypse threatens to erupt from below. But Johnson’s liquid guitar fills serve as the emergency sprinkler system that keeps the blaze in check, gradually tilting the track from sinister to serene.In the past, listening to a Wooden Shjips record felt a lot like lane-merging onto an endless freeway where everyone’s going 100mph—your only option was to go with the flow and get lost in the blur. But if “Eclipse” assumes a familiar motorik motion, the rest of V. opens up a series of off-ramps. “Red Line” has all the hallmarks of a typical Wooden Shjips jam—rhythmic repetition, droning keyboards, backward-swirled guitar solos—but molds them into pop-song proportions and infuses them with an uncharacteristic bonhomie, yielding the most upbeat, immediately engaging tune in the band’s repertoire. And even when the band threatens to drift into a classic-rock cul-de-sac, they correct course with some inspired embellishments, like the woozy synths that permeate the Stonesy country rock of “Already Gone” or the keyboard clusters that brighten up the bluesy lurch of “In the Fall” like slow-motion shooting stars."

It's as insane as it sounds. In the movie, Daltrey plays Franz Liszt, the 19th century Hungarian pianist and composer known for his flamboyant playing style-- hysterical women fought over his handkerchiefs at concerts more than a century before the Beatles. Whereas Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music represented all things respectable and classicist, Liszt was a Romantic hero full of flash; Amadeus won eight Oscars, Lisztomania boasts lines like, ""Your big ambition was to stick your working-class cock up a piece of high-class crumpet."" With their fourth album, Phoenix reference both composers and hone in on an elusive target somewhere between Mozart's formal wonders and Listz's dramatic flair. While the album's 10 songs are arranged and executed with virtuoso pop-rock precision, they chronicle nothing but angst, confusion, disappointment, and despair. It's truly universal-- everybody live, love, and die.Much of the album's internal conflict is laid out in its first couple lines. ""So sentimental; not sentimental, no!/ Romantic; not disgusting yet,"" sings frontman Thomas Mars on opener ""Lisztomania"", sounding like a madman with two tiny creatures whispering into each ear. Mars keeps this treacherous divide in mind throughout Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, and the rest of the record successfully avoids mush while keeping its beating heart intact. And the issue of thematic directness is especially important to Phoenix-- this is an established indie band writing songs about love that are armed with hooks primed for a mainstream embrace. Just listen to the invincible crescendo of Wolfgang's ""Countdown""-- especially that little Coldplay-esque piano twinkle about three and a half minutes in-- and realize that these guys are a few Chris Martin-isms away from staggering ubiquity. They're a bona fide ""should be bigger"" band.But, as their songs tighten into increasingly effective bursts of pop, Mars is breaking up his words and meanings into smaller and smaller fragments. His isn't a self-congratulatory, indie-nerd triumph, though, i.e., Mars isn't being cryptic to be an asshole. He's getting better and more sophisticated as his band discards anything-- an outro, a bridge, an extra hi-hat hit-- that could be deemed superfluous. Sure: YouTube tells us this album will make a generation-spanning touchstone like The Breakfast Club that much better. It'll also hit your gut if you listen hard enough. There are layers here-- maybe too many layers for the biggest rooms."

0DmkBOGgEWMbUJlL6VwwF2,0.675,97.04,0.612,rock,-6.518,0.217,0.763,Steve Lacy,4.0,0.0231,66,gemini rights,Feel Good Indie Rock,Helmet,0.0,0.0,9.0,0.0994,feel-good,7.1,"On his second full-length album, the guitarist and producer’s songs are engorged and confident, powered by deft performances and focused storytelling.","Steve Lacy once called his commitment to DIY songwriting and production “the bare maximum.” The phrase—and the TED Talk it appeared in—championed humble tools like the jailbroken iPhone on which he recorded his 2017 solo debut as assets rather than limitations. If he could land a spot in the Internet’s lineup, score Grammy nominations, and book recording sessions with Solange and Ezra Koenig just from fiddling around in GarageBand—all as a teenager—why would he depend on professional studios and equipment to create? The motivational pitch struck a chord with aspiring musicians, but Lacy’s solo work had its limits.Although his snippets, demos, and beat loops impressively melded rock, funk, and R&B into rich blends, the songs rarely amounted to more than appetizers. Lacy’s best and fullest works (Ravyn Lenae’s Crush EP, the Internet’s Hive Mind) tended to be collaborative, his cowriters and bandmates fleshing out his sprawling ideas. His second album, Gemini Rights, affirms the value of collaborators to the guitarist and producer’s process. These songs are engorged and confident, powered by deft performances and focused storytelling rather than raw talent.Lacy reset his approach to recording to make the album. After he struggled to write using his tried-and-true phone and laptop setup, he found success working in studios alongside other artists and professional engineers. The change in venue and method shows at every level. Where lyrics often functioned as placeholders in his past music (see “Something something something” from “Basement Jack”), here they are rooted in experiences. Gemini Rights was inspired by Lacy breaking up with a boyfriend, and the songs mine the turbulence of that headspace even as Lacy sings of other lovers.He sashays between relief, regret, longing, and resentment. “If you had to stunt your shining for your lover, dump that fucker,” he croons on “Static,” dour guitar and keyboard melodies gleaming in the background. On “Mercury” his voice swings from delicate, dolce murmurs to an impassioned Auto-Tuned singsong. “Oh, I know myself, my skin/Rolling stones don’t crawl back in,” he sings, his emotions as mixed as his metaphors. The writing doesn’t always succeed at being intimate, but it is at minimum expressive, a change likely attributable to the singer Fousheé, who is credited on half the songs.Lacy foregrounds his voice more than he has previously, harmonizing with himself and his sisters on “Helmet,” dueting with Fousheé on “Sunshine,” and cooing in an airy falsetto on “Give You the World.” The falsetto is his shakiest and least personal instrument, skewing mechanical on “Amber” and “Cody Freestyle” in ways that pantomime big feelings rather than articulate them. Although he’s often compared to Prince and Stevie Wonder, Pharrell and Solange are more apt reference points—they also struggled to harness their voices early in their careers.Lacy’s lower, more talky notes are fuller and more playful, complementing his fluid guitar work. Highlight “Bad Habit” pairs bright guitar riffs and funk synths with pleading vocals, Lacy voicing his shyness with a knockout earworm on the chorus. On “Helmet,” theatrical adlibs and a plump bassline fill an otherwise defeated moment with warmth. “I tried to play pretend (Oh-oh)/Tried not to see the end (Ah-ah)/But I couldn’t see you the way you saw me/Now I can feel the waste on me,” Lacy sings. He’s more interested in understanding the failed relationship than litigating it.As Lacy zooms in on particular feelings and moments in his tales of modern heartbreak and courtship, he tends to sound detached and distant even when he speaks in first-person, and not in a dissociative way. There’s little tension or depth to the songwriting even when it flares with color, a longstanding shortcoming in his artful but often straightforward music. Gemini Rights does not set out to resolve that tendency, but the album turns toward the path. For the first time, Lacy’s virtuosity is in service of his vision rather than the extent of it."

Their debut is the sound of two women stoking mutiny from a slow descent into madness.,"If you don’t already love Wet Leg, chances are their swift rise and self-deprecation induce a particular kind of cynicism. Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers arrived fully formed with the kind of infernally catchy indie rock hit not heard since the days of Franz Ferdinand and were instantly everywhere: played to death on British alternative radio; on Jools Holland and late-night U.S. talk shows; the subject of approving texts from your dad. They repel seriousness, claiming they only started the band for fun—on top of a Ferris wheel at a music festival, no less—and their songs mean next to nothing. Apparently they barely had time to meet their future label, Domino, because they were too busy “rolling around in the grass doing teddy bear rolls with the guitars.” Their lyrics cringe with embarrassment on behalf of anyone deluded enough to be in a band, with their warm beer and crap patter and arty parties. (It’s often said that their home of the Isle of Wight lags 20 years behind the rest of the UK, and Wet Leg’s suffocating social circle sounds straight out of 2005: the Cribs’ “Hey Scenesters!,” Art Brut’s “Formed a Band” and Arctic Monkeys’ “Fake Tales of San Francisco” writ large.) You might wonder whether Wet Leg embraced indie rock as part of their larky shtick—what could be more ironic than messing around with a destitute genre?—if they weren’t such a good study.Teasdale and Chambers are carpetbaggers in the ultimate carpetbagging genre: You can play Magic Eye with their speed-addled guitars, tilting the music this way and that to spot flagrant trace notes of the Breeders, Parquet Courts, Wire, Pulp, Pavement, MGMT, the Strokes, Courtney Barnett, Blur, Elastica and a billion more bands besides. (On “Convincing,” the album’s biggest tonal outlier, Chambers sings wryly devastated Angel Olsen cosplay.) But it’s a sound that endures endless retreads as long as the hooks are good. For years, that bubblegum melodic facility seemed to have deserted bands of this ilk. The 2004 British wave stopped wanting to make “music for girls to dance to” and got sophisticated (read: boring), and the space they left was quickly filled by lumpen “whoa-oh-oh” football terrace chanters. Wet Leg have hooks stuffed with bait—and beyond convincingly consolidating past eras of guitar pop, they ply an idiosyncratic line in wild-eyed choruses that unspool in run-on bursts of mania, building to terminal velocity, tripping on internal rhymes, and dragging you down with them."

Even without the adrenaline-filled highs, the compositions are as rich and thoughtful as ever.","For Kevin Parker, perfectionism is a lonely thing. The fastidious Tame Impala mastermind often copes with his self-isolation and doubt through stonerisms, highly portable mantras like “let it happen” and “yes I’m changing” and “gotta be above it” (said three times fast to ward off bad vibes). Their inverse is the negativity Parker’s trying to keep at bay in his head: “It feels like we only go backwards,” “But you’ll make the same old mistakes,” “You will never come close to how I feel.” It is easy to get lost in all the layers of groovy, time-traveling technicolor surround sound, particularly because Parker isn’t really trying to be clever or literary, but the internal tug of war within the Australian musician’s lyrics—between trying to better yourself and stay present, or succumbing to your own worst thoughts—is part of what keeps fans faithfully returning to Tame’s three albums, perhaps subconsciously. The repetition of phrases pairs well with the dubby, trance-like aspects of the music. Think of it as psychedelia for people with meditation apps and vape pens: Instead of opening your mind, you’re just trying to silence it.On Tame Impala’s fourth album, Parker addresses the eternal enemy of perfectionists everywhere: time. He struggled with it himself, considering The Slow Rush arrives five years after Currents, the album that made his one-man band more famous than he could’ve imagined. Parker has toured arenas, headlined mega-festivals, worked with Travis Scott and Kanye West, more or less ditched the skinny scarves, and had the rare honor of being covered by Rihanna (and making her dance like this). He intended to release The Slow Rush just before headlining Coachella last April, but he didn’t feel like it was ready yet. You could sense that flux in the album rollout: First single “Patience” hinted at a yacht-rock direction but ultimately didn’t make the cut; second single “Borderline” was trimmed and beefed up for the LP; and the whole thing was remastered following a November 2019 listening party, where he couldn’t stop noticing things he wanted to tweak. Given time, Parker will tinker.Clearly, all the tinkering paid off. The Slow Rush is an extraordinarily detailed opus whose influences reach into specific corners of the past six decades, from Philly soul and early prog to acid house, adult-contemporary R&B, and Late Registration. I have to marvel that all this sound and history comes from Parker alone, picking every string and twisting every knob. He’s always used strong melodies and riffs to anchor his more unconventional structures, but there seems to have been a slight shift in perspective: Working with hip-hop producers got him thinking more about samples—how they unite music of different eras and genres under one roof."
4vjvx7Zxkb4AltGcZ0BBvI,0.749,131.024,0.6,rock,-6.889,0.0915,0.485,Phoebe Bridgers,4.0,0.0419,64,punisher,Feel Good Indie Rock,Kyoto,0.295,1.0,11.0,0.0467,feel-good,8.7,"On her marvelous second album, Phoebe Bridgers defines her songwriting: candid, multi-dimensional, slyly psychedelic, and full of heart. Her music has become a world unto itself.","Phoebe Bridgers is a master of collapse. The 25-year-old California native writes songs for those moments when things fall apart, when language fails, when you long for so much distance that you need a spaceship to reach it. From there, she is able to find a sense of purpose, or at least make a plan. “When I get back I’ll lay around/Then I’ll get up and lay back down,” goes a couplet in “I Know the End,” the closing track of her stunning new album Punisher. Across the song’s two halves, she tethers the anxiety of leaving home to a vivid depiction of an actual apocalypse: lightning crashes, fire rises, people scream. “Yeah, I guess the end is here,” she deadpans. Her delivery is light, insistent—the casual tone you use to convey passing thoughts to the closest person in the room.While Punisher is only her second full-length collection as a solo artist, Bridgers has already established a distinct worldview. Her songs can be autobiographical—2017’s “Motion Sickness” bluntly described an emotionally abusive relationship with a since-spurned, one-time mentor—but her writing is too self-aware and wide-ranging to feel confessional. It can be sad, but she is also the first to call bullshit on letting one emotion consume her. It’s why she will infuse a track like this album’s “Moon Song,” an otherwise wistful ballad that takes place at a birthday party, with a banal detail (“It’s nautical themed”) or an outright dismissal of art born from tragedy. “We hate ‘Tears in Heaven,’” she sings of Eric Clapton’s autobiographical, once-inescapable ballad. Then she concedes, “But it’s sad that his baby died.”This impulse toward the candid, the multi-dimensional, has also come to define the sound of Bridgers’ music. Self-produced with Tony Berg and Ethan Gruska, these songs are starkly drawn and colorfully embellished, produced in service of each individual story. Punisher’s first single, “Garden Song,” is a marvel not only for how seamlessly its lyrics bind fantasies and nightmares, burning houses and blooming flowers, but also for how each element of its slyly psychedelic arrangement travels along with her words. The fingerpicked riff is played on a guitar that seems to be dissolving; a low, male voice comes in like a record playing at the wrong speed; a steady pulse seems to rise from somewhere deep in your headphones.Bridgers also writes about this very sensation: the way we hear music, how we devote ourselves to it and form identities around it. On Punisher, these relationships are mostly fraught, from a fan being murdered outside Dodger Stadium to a couple channeling deeper issues through a fight about John Lennon. If music was a pathway toward spiritual catharsis in earlier songs like “Smoke Signals” and “Me & My Dog,” the same drugs don’t work here. Ironically, the most upbeat songs house her bleakest thoughts. “Chinese Satellite,” buoyed by a rushing string arrangement, finds her adrift, desperate for a sign, singing the “same three songs over and over.” And in “Kyoto,” she undercuts a breezy horn section and her most festival-ready chorus by refusing to play along: “I’m a liar,” she sings in its closing line, holding out the syllables so she can’t be misunderstood."

Sharon Van Etten seems to acknowledge this at the beginning of OH NO, when she asks Jamie Stewart: “What were you doing there, so un-anxious to be liked?” That’s the question regarding a glorious, terrible, improbable body of work that has shades of The Velvet Underground, Suicide, and Einstürzende Neubauten but really sounds only like itself.Though Xiu Xiu is now a duo with Angela Seo, Stewart is the lifetime member. He’s spent the last 20 years blazing an illegible path, musically and morally, between queer politics and shock-jock shtick, radical vulnerability and repugnant cruelty, good faith and bad taste. The music varies wildly in style—from punky folk and dreamy pop to experimental electronics and harsh noise, all teeming with global instruments—and quality, from the heart-filled zenith of “I Luv the Valley, OH!” to the heartless nadir of “I Luv Abortion.” For every song you’d defend with your last breath, there’s another you couldn’t defend with your first. Most perverse is when they blend into the likes of “Ale,” a gorgeous tune about telling an overweight woman playing GameCube to shut up.It wasn’t always this way. The urge to disturb has been part of Xiu Xiu since the beginning, but there’s something elemental and pure about those early releases, which calibrated their shocks with tenderness and grace, brilliantly modulating danger and desire in mini-masterpieces like “Fabulous Muscles.” Such moments are scattered across Xiu Xiu’s later days, but the signal-to-noise ratio decidedly shifted. Shock art has to shock itself, and gradually it grows numb. The music got sprawlier, louder, more hectoring; the targets of Stewart’s disgust grew increasingly outlandish; there were chiptune experiments and free-jazz Nina Simone covers; the lyrics developed a worrisome onomatopoeia habit. At last check, Stewart was up to his old tricks on the bombastic Girl With Basket of Fruit, the title track of which contains lines like “A flock of erect dicks on bat wings pee-pees into her sleeping face.”This is why a record as modest as OH NO, on which Stewart duets with more than a dozen indie, punk, and experimental music friends, feels disproportionately appealing. One hesitates to say he’s “grown up,” both because it’s a condescending cliché and because he’ll probably come back with an album called I Luv COVID or something. But OH NO, which is reportedly about a personal betrayal, comes out as a pretty sweet meditation on friendship, with nary a try-hard shock to be found. The collaborations clear the clotted atmosphere and perhaps have a tempering effect. You probably don’t get Sharon Van Etten in the studio by asking her to sing about clubbing baby seals over a bunch of crashing sounds."

The billboard showed a hellish crack in the ground oozing a toxic green light. Jessy Lanza started seeing these advertisements right around the time she moved into her co-producer Jeremy Greenspan’s (of Junior Boys) home to write her sophomore album *Oh No. *She was also convinced right around the same time, that the air quality in their shared home was poisonous. In order to fight the incoming entropy, she surrounded herself with tropical plants to clean the air, and she completed an album that recycled the bad voodoo into something remarkably generative and self-assured.She told the FADER that in general  she’s “always thinking of ways to alleviate waking up every day and feeling a deep sense of dread.” Oh No in its own way is about harnessing anxiety and estrangement—imagining how all of her bundles of pent-up nervous energy could be harnessed into a productive flow. The music here is what happens when you turn that faucet on and let all the power just stream out. *Oh No *is a gorgeous and deadly pop music manifesto that proves yet again the sad girls are not vulnerable and silent subjects. Or as Lindsay Zoladz once wrote, music in this mode is not exactly “sadness” but an expression of  a “particular kind of strength—one that allows the contradictions, complexity, and emotional range of a lived experience.”In the last three years since her debut, Pull My Hair Back, it's obvious by just listening to this album that both her singing and production efforts have matured exponentially. The songs are freewheeling collages of  '90s R&B, Chicago footwork, acid house, disco, and wonky minimalist pop, using simple instrumentation to span multiple moods and BPMs. Meanwhile, Lanza’s singing works overtime, lifting boulders and throwing them across city blocks. Her lyrics are blunt and straightforward, but her singing allows her to imbue even the most casual and static of statements with a sense of devastating irony. For example in “Going Somewhere” she treats pandering and all its silent erosion with subtle shifts in phrasing, hiccuping in the middle of lines like “Say you love me” and “Baby I just want to impress you"" as if she was almost giggling at the thought.The exhortations of hurt in Lanza’s songs are not coming from the perspective of someone sulking over their wounds, but a place of triumphant reclamation. The production and her singing on this album reach full symmetry in the album’s centerpiece, “It Means I Love You.” It’s a frenetic blend of footwork surrounding a supine ballad of loss. It tastefully samples a tabla beat from a South African song, and swaddles this percussion in slashing synths. Her voice carries along with the instrumentation in a deathly shadow dance, mimicking its jerky changes in tempo and pitch effortlessly. It all stops just for a moment when she tells the listener, and the beloved, to look into her eyes, because that's when you it means she loves you. In that pocket of seconds, it feels like you’ve been turned into stone."

The drummer practices some rolls, a buzzing input jack is plugged in, a firecracker goes off, and then somebody shouts ""1, 2, 3, 4!"", miraculously transmuting this rambunctious rehearsal into a clean-cut, impeccably sequenced full-length. Nearly every rock band's done it, and for the listener who really wants to connect, it's great playacting. Thus, in four seconds of fuzz and feedback, power-pop hucksters OK Go kick off their second LP with said theatrical flair and continue the charade for 13 rigid, self-conscious tracks.Mimicry is one thing, but at least choose wisely. You see, OK Go decide to impersonate post-Pinkerton, post-catchy, fun-by-numbers Weezer, resulting in an Ivy Leaguer Sugar Ray sound. Worse yet, they keep one thumb in whatever pie MTV currently deems popular. Their summery self-titled debut cashed in on the short-lived Phantom Planet/Rooney craze, and Oh No egregiously hangs on the new wave bandwagon like a barnacle. If that chunky, clumsy riff on single ""Do What You Want"" sounds familiar, it should. Producer Tore Johansson tries to inject dance-rock into Oh No, apparently using leftover scraps from his Franz Ferdinand sessions. Unfortunately, the infusion sticks out like a rejected kidney, and Johansson often concedes to OK Go's smarmy schlock rock.Frontman Damian Kulash calls most of the shots here, and not surprisingly, his frat boy spin on Elvis Costello shows marginal progress since ""You're So Damn Hot"". When he's not screaming ""come on!"" or ""hey!"", Kulash's razor wit tackles an array of subjects ranging from women to girls to chicks. His poetics may not run deep, but they certainly go on forever. Opener ""Invincible"", this album's ""Get Over It"", is meat-and-potatoes arena rock documenting Kulash's bizarre metaphor about a superhero girl who saves the world from aliens: ""When they finally come to destroy the earthÉthey won't know about the thousand Fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes."" Damian Kulash majored in semiotics at Brown University, just throwing that out there.So okay I get it, these guys are a ""fun"" band, and that's great, I love fun. Why, though, does their music play by such strict rules? Their only curveballs thrown here are Beach Boys harmonies and the same augmented chord progression, and even these twists are rationed. While their debut at least sported some guilty pleasure material, Oh No is too self-conscious for serious hooks to flourish. For what it's worth, Kulash still shows a nose for catchiness on humbler, mid-tempo songs, and without it, I wouldn't be touching this album with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole. From the impeccable touchstones to the knack for melody, everything's in place for these guys. However, as Oh No's first four seconds of guitar noodling forecast, these guys simply try too hard."

He’s worked as a producer and songwriter on music beloved on a wide scale (Sara Bareilles’ “Brave,” Zayn and Taylor’s “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever”) and more cultishly appreciated (Tegan and Sara’s “How Come You Don’t Want Me,” Grimes’ “Entropy”)—but you know his work when you hear it. Antonoff’s first solo album as Bleachers, 2014’s Strange Desire, was a lovable exploration of the ideas at the core of his sound: all the piano breaks and gated-reverb drums, the gang vocals and the ceaseless, head-spinning barrage of hooks. But to the world at large, it was less of a breakthrough than a sturdy business card. By the end of that year, he’d be better known for accompanying one of the world’s biggest pop stars on her biggest album yet.In an interview with Pitchfork, Antonoff discussed his guiding principle as a collaborator: “If I ever work with someone else, all that I think about is: Do you want to make the best album you’ve ever made in your life, or not?” It’s a lofty standard, but one he also sets for himself as a solo artist. The best song on Strange Desire was called “I Wanna Get Better”: While its title was a response to hitting rock bottom, it’s a sentiment that also applies to the heights of his success. In fact, if there’s any major similarity between Antonoff and Bruce Springsteen—an artist he frequently cites as an inspiration—it’s his unabashed ambition: a conviction so earnest and ingrained that it could be mistaken for humility.Regardless of what people think of Gone Now, Antonoff's stately and uneven sophomore album, he’s already mythologizing it and shaping a world around its songs. Antonoff clearly believes that Gone Now is his masterpiece, and everything around the record suggests as much. He’s somehow touring the bedroom where it was conceived as a “moving, living art installation”: an act of hubris so indulgent even Jay Z waited 20 years before attempting it. From beginning to end, Gone Now has all the affectations of an over-the-top pop masterpiece. There are spoken-word samples, saxophone solos, and sound effects; guest appearances, multipart reprises, and allusions. In the opening lines of the self-reflexive first track “Dream of Mickey Mantle,” Antonoff is romanticizing the album’s creation: “All the hope I had when I was young/I hope I wasn’t wrong/I miss those days so I sing a ‘Don’t Take the Money’ song.” Here, he poses the driving question of Gone Now: Is Antonoff really as great as he thinks he is?"

For my parents' generation, it's hard to think of a better one than the Radio Flyer wagon. These simple red-and-white carts with oversized black rubber wheels are as emblematic of suburban childhood in the 40s and 50s as ICBMs were to the Cold War, and almost anyone who grew up in the postwar era remembers their ubiquity fondly-- they actually outsold Ford station wagons for a number of years.The Radio Flyer of my generation might be the Casio keyboard. I can remember getting one when I was a kid that had maybe three octaves and about 10 or 12 sounds along with classic preset rhythms they called ""rhumba"" and ""bossa nova."" My brother and I spent plenty of time parlaying that keyboard into extended sessions of annoyance for my parents, and I'll never get over how amazing we thought it was when we were young that you could get these little demos playing on it and then speed them up or slow them down at will. I remember a specific instance when the keyboard's batteries were dying, but still had enough juice in them to produce a sputtering, vaguely piano-ish sound when you hit the keys. Just a few months ago, I rediscovered a brief recording that I'd made of this phenomenon on a boombox, and it sounds oddly poignant, this wandering quasi-melody of wavering and decaying notes.Whatever spoke to me about the sound of that failing machine years ago apparently also captivated Parts & Labor's Dan Friel as he worked on Sunburned, his second solo EP and his first to see proper release on a label. He opens the disc with a track called ""Dead Batteries"", a song literally built on a foundation of an old Casio struggling to play a rhythm preset with the power provided by nearly expended C batteries. The effect is a twitching, crackling foundation for his laser-toned guitar to slice through that perfectly sets the tone for this intriguing, challenging disc.Friel has slowly been making a name for himself in Brooklyn not only with Parts & Labor, who last year split a full-length with rising avant-garde star Tyondai Braxton (now a member of Battles alongside ex-Don Caballero guitarist Ian Williams), but also with his bit parts in ensembles helmed by Damo Suzuki and Glenn Branca. In his spare time, he records with an intentionally limited setup, working to coax the best music he can from an array of electronics like remote-controlled car joysticks and walkie talkies. The squealing, dense textures he builds from those sounds form the bulk of this record, and he interacts with them with his electric guitar, pouring on layer after layer of his distinctly hued drones and distorted overtone series until the wall of sounds is complete."

It's as insane as it sounds. In the movie, Daltrey plays Franz Liszt, the 19th century Hungarian pianist and composer known for his flamboyant playing style-- hysterical women fought over his handkerchiefs at concerts more than a century before the Beatles. Whereas Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music represented all things respectable and classicist, Liszt was a Romantic hero full of flash; Amadeus won eight Oscars, Lisztomania boasts lines like, ""Your big ambition was to stick your working-class cock up a piece of high-class crumpet."" With their fourth album, Phoenix reference both composers and hone in on an elusive target somewhere between Mozart's formal wonders and Listz's dramatic flair. While the album's 10 songs are arranged and executed with virtuoso pop-rock precision, they chronicle nothing but angst, confusion, disappointment, and despair. It's truly universal-- everybody live, love, and die.Much of the album's internal conflict is laid out in its first couple lines. ""So sentimental; not sentimental, no!/ Romantic; not disgusting yet,"" sings frontman Thomas Mars on opener ""Lisztomania"", sounding like a madman with two tiny creatures whispering into each ear. Mars keeps this treacherous divide in mind throughout Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, and the rest of the record successfully avoids mush while keeping its beating heart intact. And the issue of thematic directness is especially important to Phoenix-- this is an established indie band writing songs about love that are armed with hooks primed for a mainstream embrace. Just listen to the invincible crescendo of Wolfgang's ""Countdown""-- especially that little Coldplay-esque piano twinkle about three and a half minutes in-- and realize that these guys are a few Chris Martin-isms away from staggering ubiquity. They're a bona fide ""should be bigger"" band.But, as their songs tighten into increasingly effective bursts of pop, Mars is breaking up his words and meanings into smaller and smaller fragments. His isn't a self-congratulatory, indie-nerd triumph, though, i.e., Mars isn't being cryptic to be an asshole. He's getting better and more sophisticated as his band discards anything-- an outro, a bridge, an extra hi-hat hit-- that could be deemed superfluous. Sure: YouTube tells us this album will make a generation-spanning touchstone like The Breakfast Club that much better. It'll also hit your gut if you listen hard enough. There are layers here-- maybe too many layers for the biggest rooms."

Dressed in exaggerated, skinny-hipster re-imaginings of old-school rappers or drag queens, Starfucker come off like a combination of Chromeo and ELO, indulging in theatrical silliness while conjuring sugary pop hooks. Onstage, the members swap multiple instruments, providing a kinetic, anything-can-happen energy. But sadly, the studio strips Starfucker of their visual appeal, rhythmic heft, and electricity, leaving wispy electro-pop songs, washed-out vocals, and skittishly edited samples in their place.Their self-titled debut is a mix of primary songwriter Josh Hodges' home recordings and some after-the-fact finessing from his bandmates and label head, which helps explain why it feels flatter than the group's full-bodied stage show. The tinny percussion and slinky, reverb-laden bass are shadows of their usual selves. And the songs-- always saturated with themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and loss behind upbeat instrumentation-- simply feel boringly melancholy without the live party atmosphere.Most of these songs are wrapped in a gauzy, echo-laden wash that has a distancing effect on the music, but a few lovely standouts pierce the poor production. ""German Love"" latches on to a sweet guitar melody amidst stuttering samples, layering a bright sing-along chorus over a neon keyboard line. ""Holly"" marries cheeky, deadpan lyrics (""L.A. hasn't killed me yet"") to ticking percussion, soulful guitar, and a repetitive, descending synth riff for a track that wouldn't sound out of place on Fujiya & Miyagi's setlist. And ""Pop Song"" is exactly as advertised: A strutting gem that uses a funky bassline, distorted effects, and videogame synths to enhance the band's best melody. Unfortunately, too many of the songs highlight Starfucker's shortcomings, leaving them introspective, detached, and even timid. If this three-piece can learn to have as much fun in the studio as they do onstage, these fuckers might actually become stars."

More often than not, it ends up sounding like a Broadway tribute.","In Daisy Jones & the Six, the bestselling novel inspired by Fleetwood Mac’s tumultuous history, Taylor Jenkins Reid writes an album’s worth of song lyrics to hint at her fictional band’s pathos. In the climactic “Regret Me,” frontwoman Daisy Jones delivers a devastating burn to her co-lead and songwriting partner, Billy Dunne: “When you think of me, I hope it ruins rock’n’roll.” It’s a terrible line, but in the book it’s met with shock and awe. Reid’s lyrics are packed with zingers capturing the vocalists’ romantic tension, a strain that ultimately spells the Six’s undoing.“Regret Me” gets the full studio treatment in the Amazon Original series, an adaptation of Reid’s book. While the TV version of that song is outfitted with new lyrics, the barbs are similarly clunky: “Go ahead and regret me/But I’m beating you to it, dude.” Still, the soundtrack album accompanying the series, Aurora, is a can’t-lose proposition for producer Blake Mills. With crack session players and a fathomless budget behind him, he gets to chase his own Laurel Canyon masterpiece; the fictional conceit provides cover when he falls short. Contributors on this record include Marcus Mumford, Madison Cunningham, and Roger Joseph Manning Jr. The fact that they got the Jackson Browne to write music for the adaptation of a supermarket novel says more about the record biz than Amazon’s mockumentary possibly could.At its most ambitious, Aurora approximates the incremental trajectories of Fleetwood Mac’s late-’70s work. “Let Me Down Easy” and “Regret Me” careen through striking melodic pivots, anchored by warm Rhodes keys and the vocal harmonies of actors Sam Claflin and Riley Keough, who play Jones and Dunne in the series. On “Look at Us Now (Honeycomb),” the acoustic chords and kick drum gather momentum en route to a soaring single-chord guitar solo. It’s a clear nod to Rumours’ “The Chain,” but the degree of intricacy—not to mention the bravura guitar work—makes for a rewarding homage.Mills knows that trying to replicate Fleetwood Mac’s opus is a fool’s errand, so he hedges his bets. The title track is more redolent of the Nashville machine than Laurel Canyon, and the vocal duets betray a Broadway sheen. On “Look at Us Now,” Claflin’s exaggerated vibrato fails to compensate for underwritten lyrics: “I don’t know who I am, baby, baby, baby/Do you know who you are? Is it out of our hands?” There’s no symbolism or mystique, no white-winged doves or Rhiannons—it’s hard to imagine any of these adult-contemporary show tunes cracking the FM rotation, let alone in 1977."

Yes, it's yet another side project release from the folks that brought you Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Set Fire to Flames and the Silver Mt. Zion Hoonja-Doonja Ice Cream Symposium. The fact that there's a Motherfucker (as in Jackie-O) along for the ride doesn't change the overriding MO of the primary players. Aurora is gorgeous, cinematic stuff, dominated by cello and eccentric percussive instruments like clevises and rototom shells. And, unsurprisingly, the packaging is equally gorgeous-- an embossed gatefold CD sleeve complete with black disc envelope and postcard, as well as slightly skewed typeface setting.Folks not yet inured to this collective's bombast and grandeur might be surprised by how gentle and serene these tracks are. ""Histories Repeating..."" lists in a foggy meditative fashion for nearly 17 minutes, while the comparatively pop-length ""Why She Swallows..."" twinkles and trembles. When there's a threat of the folks rocking out in a hamfisted fashion (as on the very first track, ""Quelques Mots Pleins D'ombre""), Esmerine opts to err on the demure side of aggression. Folks unfamiliar with all things godsped, but with a predilection for groups like Rachels and the Dirty Three, might also want to give this a try.For those that got over the gorgeous instrumentation and the importance of each telegraphed loud-soft shift and the interminable song titles sometime after Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada, this disc will seem relentlessly polite and tasteful. More importantly, Aurora won't sound much different than anything this group-- together or apart-- has already produced. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that, for all intents and purposes, it's the same thing."

The first sound on the first song, ""Mansard Roof"", comes from Rostam Batmanglij's keyboard, set to a perky, almost piping tone-- the kind of sunny sound you'd hear in old west-African pop. Same goes for Ezra Koenig's guitar, which never takes up too much space; it's that clean, natural tone you'd get on a record from Senegal or South Africa. Chris Baio's bass pulses and slides and steps with light feet, and most of all there's Chris Tomson, who plays like a percussionist as often as he does a rock drummer, tapping out rhythms and counter-accents on a couple of drums in the back of the room. And yet they play it all like indie kids on a college lawn, because they're not hung up on Africa in the least-- a lot of these songs work more like those on the Strokes' debut, Is This It?, if you scraped off all the scuzzy rock'n'roll signifiers, leaving behind nothing but clean-cut pop and preppy new wave, tucked-in shirts and English-lit courses.This Afro/preppy/new-wave combination has a history-- Brits like Orange Juice, Americans like Talking Heads. For now, though, it's one of the most deservedly buzzed-about things around: People have been chattering over Vampire Weekend ever since a CD-R demo of three of these songs started circulating last year. (Full disclosure: One of the sound engineers of that CD-R now does freelance audio work for Pitchfork.) The excitement isn't hard to fathom. People spend a lot of time poking around for the edgy new underground thing, convinced that plain old pop songs have been done to death. But Vampire Weekend come along like Belle & Sebastian and the Strokes each did, sounding refreshingly laidback and uncomplicated, and with simple set-ups that make good songs sound exceedingly easy. (The result being not ""this is mind-blowing,"" or ""this is catchy,"" but ""I have listened to this, straight through, four times a day for the past month"".)No surprise, then, that their first hit mp3 would be a song called ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", which is sly, quiet, and casual in a way that blows away so many other bands who actively try to get your attention. Their label seems to have understood this effect, and so they've left these demos sounding as natural as they were: This release just fiddles with the mastering, switches out a few takes in ways you wouldn't much notice, plays with the sequencing, relegates one song to a B-side, and adds a couple of great ones that you can nonetheless understand being omitted the first time."

The silly bandname may bely their sober and resolute sound, but it's of little consequence in the shadow of this record's charismatic sophistication and outstanding songwriting that emphasizes substance-over-style, contrasting with their peers in Interpol and Franz Ferdinand.","The English live on an island, have national radio, and they had the Smiths and the Stone Roses. As a result, they're less embarrassed than Americans to dream of indie guitar bands commanding decent audiences. That's part of what Bloc Party frontman Kele Okerere seems to have in mind when he describes this album as ""Technicolor."" He means it has big sound, big hooks, energetic performances, ambition-- all the things that make rock bands sound skilled and confident. He means no messing around, no interludes or experiments. He means the kind of guitar record where every song wants to be as tight as the singles; the kind that wants to be worth every penny any lawn-mowing pre-teen might spend on it. Because according to him, nobody makes that kind of record anymore.That isn't true-- and the last thing anyone wants is for U2 to try harder-- but he has a point; it's no accident that there are people who think Radiohead haven't really delivered since The Bends. Put it like that, and what Bloc Party actually sound like drops pretty low on the list of things you need to know about Silent Alarm. What perhaps matters most is that they're trying to make one of those clean, consistent, ambitious Popular Guitar Rock albums-- and depending on how much stock you put in that kind of thing, they've done a great job of it. This is a solid, intelligent album that a lot of people will love-- one that'll slot onto indie-crossover CD racks right beside the debuts from Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads.Lead single ""Banquet"" is wonderfully tight and energetic-- the same kind of spiffy half-dancing rock as Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"" or Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth"". That's easy to pull off when you've got a drummer this good, and a bassist that locks in with him so neatly, whether it's for rock charge or disco hustle. That, in fact, has been Bloc Party's main selling point, apart from the whole Remarkably Competent thing: When the rhythm section stretches its limbs, they leap a good distance away from the straight-ahead eighth-note riffing of the others in this game. Filter in their timely post-punk moves, Bunnymen gestures, and pop ambitions, and you start to feel like this is what it might have been like to listen to the Police or XTC in the early 80s; the sound of a straight-up rock band just a shade more sophisticated, and a little more interested in rhythm, than most of their peers."

In 2016, Julien Baker spotted Lucy Dacus reading Henry James in the green room of a venue and felt an immediate affinity; the two became friends and developed mutual, unspoken crushes as they wrote each other lengthy correspondences online. A month later, a similar kinship transpired between Baker and Phoebe Bridgers, who traded favorite authors and poets in their own email thread. They were three young singer-songwriters of shrewd sensitivity, tentatively navigating early-career acclaim; “Things were happening for us all at the same time and I think we’ve gravitated to each other,” Baker has said. Cut to 2018, when they got booked together on a triple bill and headed into the studio, thinking they’d record one song. They emerged with six. By all accounts, making that initial Boygenius EP was an ineffable experience, the consequence of which should not be diminished through careless simile: “It was not like falling in love,” Bridgers states. “It was falling in love.”It’s not just that Boygenius poke fun at the degree to which male artists are lionized—in the EP artwork imitating Crosby, Stills, & Nash; their recent recreation of Nirvana’s 1994 Rolling Stone cover; and the new album’s working title contenders like In Rainbows and The White Album. It’s not just that their commitment to making music together pushes against the competitive forces of patriarchy, in the same spirit as women-led supergroups from Wild Flag to the Highwomen. It is that the three women seem to actually love each other, as expressed on their long-awaited debut album, ultimately titled The Record. It’s a kind of love that rejects the ingrained impulse for women to route their emotional, spiritual, and erotic attention away from their peers and toward men—what the feminist poet Adrienne Rich diagnosed in a famous essay—but also troubles the commonly accepted division between romance and friendship. Boygenius are teammates, confidantes, soon-to-be onstage make-out partners; the songs on The Record are largely for each other, about each other, littered with inside references.This time, Dacus, Bridgers, and Baker bring in the best guys in the business: Jay Som’s Melina Duterte on bass, Autolux’s Carla Azar on drums, Illuminati Hotties’ Sarah Tudzin as engineer, and Catherine Marks on co-production. The Pulitzer-nominated novelist Elif Batuman wrote the introductory essay; Oscar-nominated actress Kristen Stewart directed three Boygenius music videos. Boygenius embrace how we are always responding to and being formed by others, and how this porousness can enrich our lives. As they wonder on the album’s opener, in braided unison: “Who would I be without you, without them?”"

The duo of Errorsmith and Berghain resident Fiedel, MMM aren’t terribly prolific. Since their debut, in 1996, they’ve released just seven 12""s, all on their eponymous label, along with one half of an unusual split LP with German noise-rockers Surrogat and a handful of remixes. But their scant output is the fruit of dogged focus; each of their records feels carefully designed to make dancefloors go absolutely apeshit, using as few elements as possible.Early on, MMM developed a knack for songs that not only move your body but practically pierce your skull. The 1997 anthem “Donna” and 2010’s “Nous Sommes MMM” brandish frequencies that whir like trepanning drills, steadily increasing in pressure over whip-cracking electro drums. In recent years, their music has grown even more unhinged, pushing energy levels into the red or stripping lysergic minimalism down to splintered bone. But On the Edge, their debut LP, represents a radical reversal. Gone are the seasick pitch-shifting, the blistering distortion, the bruising kick drum. In place of MMM’s usual white-knuckled intensity, the duo explores a vibe that’s stranger, woozier, and slower, shifting their attention from far-out psychedelia to the extreme lower limits of danceability.The album begins in relatively upbeat territory: “Where to Go” is its most energetic track, coursing along upwards of 130 BPM. Yet it also displays a lightness of touch—a level of rhythmic and textural refinement—that feels new to their work. Though nominally four-to-the-floor, the kick drum falls only on the first and third beats of each bar, giving the rhythm a springy, moon-walking cadence; soft, syncopated chords suggest a reggae band covering Raymond Scott’s Soothing Sounds for Baby, while squirrelly little drum-machine fills add to the lighthearted air.If you’re not paying attention, you might not even realize that what follows, “Everything Falls Into Place,” is a new song. It’s essentially a dub version of the opening track made with little more than glancing echoes of its glowing chords, the anti-matter to its matter. An overwhelming emptiness also defines the third track, “On the Edge,” which colors in the faintest percussive outline—skipping hi-hat, steady kick drum, occasional clap—with the dubbed-out ghost of a single chord. The equally vacuumed-out fourth track, “No Thought,” underscores the nothingness at the heart of the album.The remaining tracks proceed like a balloon that’s steadily leaking air: Each one is a little bit slower and more enervated than the one before. “The Interview” deploys scraping cello—shades of Mica Levi—over staggering kick drum and clattering spring reverb. (“Everybody gets, you know, chills,” intones an unidentified woman, neatly summing up the effect. “When I don’t get those chills, I am very disappointed, and I just want to cry.”) “Farsta Dream” twists a mournful vocal melody over wraithlike chords; “When Does Ghosting End” collapses into a languid groove reminiscent of Andy Stott at his most soporific. By the end, with “So Nigh,” there’s nothing left but an eerily processed voice over lethargic kick drums, all of it soaked in the clammy reverb of a freeway underpass.But for all the murk, these final tracks are never actually gloomy. Even with their boots stuck deep in the mud, MMM remain fundamentally playful, and even at its darkest, their music is distinguished by its lightness of spirit. When MMM played Krakow’s Unsound Festival last month, their set skewed heavily toward On the Edge, but even way down in the double-digit BPMs, they kept the peak-time crowd engaged. The low end was voluminous and enveloping; their trademark hi-hats were sharp as scalpels. It was a good reminder of the risks that dance music can take. MMM have proven time and again that they’re masters of the full-on; with On the Edge, they show that emptied out can be just as satisfying.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

So it's not to say that Tape Deck Mountain don't have potential-- good chunks of Ghost boast bristly textures and psych-soaked noodlings that feel much richer thanks to surprisingly full-sounding production-- but it's rarely realized here, rendering this collection of songs, for the most part, inert.Like a sort of extended jam (bookended by two proper-sounding singles, ""Ghost Colony"" and ""Scantrons""-- two of the only songs that seem to truly adhere to the whole ghost/grades theme), most of the tracks bleed into one another, or borrow small pieces from their predecessor and transfigure them slightly, enough so we can discern one portion from another. Much of the spaced-out aimlessness of ""80/20"" is ramped up for that wild first quarter of ""Dead Doctors""; the irritating, bland ""F-"" is followed by the album's real highlight ""On My Honor"", which affords the album some necessary ""bigness"" it sorely lacks. Like an embryonic Spoon demo, ""Honor""'s pre-programmed bossa nova beats and dead-eyed sing-along chorus feel on the money.However, as with almost everything else on Ghost, that too is swiftly marred by frontman Travis Trevisan's flat, self-aware delivery-- ""Man down, dead on the field/ Wolves eat all of his meat/ Now I know the the pain, and I question the game,"" could've worked as pure camp, but not when presented so pensively. So even in those fleeting moments when there actually is something to sink your teeth into-- the dissonant decay on the back half of ""In the Dirt"" or the spooked-out tones on ""Ghost Colony""-- most of the energy you'll burn exercising these inane couplets from your mind (""Please don't marry that asshole Larry/ I know he'll move the place you're buried, next to me"") provides little patience for much else.Maybe it's just that Tape Deck Mountain suffer from some rare form of test anxiety. There are plenty of cues to be taken that would lead you to believe that if given a little space, TDM could properly expand some of these ideas and build something more expansive and full, most likely in a live setting. The singles might provide some of the clearest insight here: Opener ""Scantrons"" isn't very memorable, but something in Trevisan's approximation of Ian Curtis' ""Atmosphere""-cribbing lilt, coupled with those portentous drums, produces a feeling of real possibility. Even on the mundane ""Ghost Colony"" (which kind of sounds like a Thursday throw-away at half-speed), the bigger moments-- where guitars crash and sequencers explode-- offer helpful hints. But Ghost rarely does get the hint, often left too slight and too self-important for it's own good. In the future, hopefully TDM will take some time to carefully read the intructions and sharpen those No. 2s before making their mark, heavy and dark."

He's also half of the Morr duo Electric President, a project focused on muted indie pop in the Postal Service vein that has come to define the label. But where Electric President continually reminds you of digital nature of the production, with its glitchy beats and cut-up instruments, Radical Face is where Cooper indulges his more trad songwriting ambitions. Though it is sequenced and computer-tweaked, this is folk-flavored indie rock for the Sufjan set, with banjo, accordion, and organ augmenting the central acoustic guitar.Despite being a solo project with acoustic leanings, Radical Face is a much ""bigger"" album than the more electronic Electric President's 2006 debut. Home studios being what they are these days, Cooper generally gets an impressively layered sound out of his array of instruments, and he structures his songs to show his production prowess in the most flattering light. When the forceful strums and clattering background percussion of ""Welcome Home""-- the melody reminds me a bit of Simon & Garfunkel with less than half the vocal range-- turns around into the soaring wordless chorus, all available space is filled and the pang of longing feels real. During its even grander climax, the longer ""Glory"" squeezes in whistling, a multi-tracked Cooper doing three-part harmony, loads of acoustic and electric guitars, and bashing drums. When the overdriven guitar fades out after the final chord, it segues seamlessly into a vibraphone loop mixed with crackling vinyl (a recurring motif) and the light piano that opens ""Strangest Things"". The transitions and sequencing here seem carefully considered, with bits of field recordings and sampled voices carrying the mood from one song to the next.Two problems present themselves. First, though the production is initially arresting, it begins to feel a bit flat and lifeless over the record's length. It's a setback similar to the one I encountered listening to Psapps The Only Thing I Ever Wanted, and may just be a personal aversion to a certain kind of forward leaning, TV-show-montage-ready mode of digital recording. While surface noise is non-existent, the dynamic range seems oddly pinched and the musical field indistinct. Ghost, in a purely sonic sense, is simply tiring to listen to.The second issue is more subjective still, and it has to do with Cooper's voice. He does what he can with his flat and nasal instrument, which is at times reminiscent of Dean Wareham with a head cold. He restricts his melodies to notes he can hit, and you can make compelling and even classic songs with such limitations (see Leonard Cohen's discography). But Cooper has the added handicap of a bland vocal personality. He certainly sounds sincere and occasionally even sweet, but mostly his singing is disconcertingly generic. Which is the sort of thing that will bother some and others, perhaps feeling empathy with the underdog, will be drawn to. From where I sit, his voice brings down what otherwise seems to be a promising album of reasonably catchy songs."

So when one of them leaves us—as did Patrick Doyle, who passed away in March 2018, just 32—the loss is huge, with its own special echoes.Doyle had spent at least half his quick life in bands with casual indie characters that inspired fast devotion. In the post-Pastels, Belle and Sebastian-besotted Scotland where he grew up, Doyle jangled his guitar in cult bands Dot to Dot, the Royal We, and the Sexy Kids, and strummed the bass along with Franz Ferdinand’s Paul Thomson in Correcto; in 2006, B&S immortalized his charisma, not to mention his handsome face, across the back of their The Life Pursuit album. Doyle taught himself drums and then went on to pursue fame with bandmate Roxanne Clifford in London as Veronica Falls, whose two rather accomplished albums of lush, lovely indie rock, released by bookish noise-pop heroes Slumberland, sounded like a platonic 21st century Mamas & the Papas where the dreams never end. They were one of those bands that if you heard them, you loved them, but too few ever did.Ever on the move, Doyle spent time in New York, Los Angeles, and London, releasing his first real solo record in 2016, as Boys Forever. If you were ever in a gay bar with a decent jukebox in any of those cities back then, you likely met him and wanted to get to know him better. Insouciant and stylish as its creator, Boys Forever repositioned classic indie verse/chorus/verse into queer forms. “Bent music for bent people,” Doyle called it; at its best, it seemed to identify musical corners the heroic gay men who’d come before him had painted themselves into—the endless genre drag of the Magnetic Fields, the so-ironic-it’s-earnest (or is the other way around?) productions of the Hidden Cameras—and just sort of breeze past them. Harder than it sounds.Just after the album’s release, Doyle relocated full-time to L.A., living with his husband, the journalist Max Padilla; developing a body of work as a photographer; and writing songs via email with Helen Skinner, a bassist and member of Boys Forever’s touring lineup. A year later, Padilla died. Doyle released a single, “As You Disappear,” in which his boyish voice is weathered and worn, a cold wind bothering the trees. “And now everyone I know, I used to know,” he sings. And then Doyle was dead, too."

That sentiment also serves as a general consensus about the state of indie rock in the half-decade since the band’s official breakup: Vivian Girls, along with the North Brooklyn DIY scene they came to represent, have died.But even after their demise, it was hard not to hear Vivian Girls everywhere. Their spirit existed, in their absence, in the school-choir harmonies of Girlpool and Ovlov, the electric fuzz that burns after a Deli Girls track or a Priests riff, the hesitant confidence of Frankie Cosmos’ lyrics. That’s not to suggest the band only touched the lives of female and nonbinary musicians—look no further than Wavves, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, or the entire Orchid Tapes catalog for their stoned ennui. But perhaps these groups could thrive, both critically and in the harsh spotlight of the internet, because Vivian Girls forged a brave new world of punk rock that wasn’t afraid of a beautiful vocal harmony, one that could exist in between the uncompromising politics of riot grrrl and the soft hues of twee-pop.Ramone, bassist Katy Goodman, and drummer Ali Koehler could have cleaned up their sound and shaken off their harsher edges. Instead, from the first chord of opener “Most of All,” the band jumps back into fried guitar, loose percussion, and fast and easy repetition, as if they’d simply woken up from an eight-year nap in the middle of a set. If anything, the group leans into their garage rock roots a bit more, letting songs spiral out, as on “I’m Far Away”’s scorched guitar solo or the prolonged, slowcore-indebted outro to “Something to Do.”The band stretches their blend of punk and ethereal pop the farthest on the uncharacteristically slow-building “Lonely Girl,” where a muted kick drum hits like a resting heartbeat as layers build around it. And then, after two minutes of long vowels and drawn-out sentences, the song picks up steam, as if the band chugs a Red Bull each time Cassie repeats the titular phrase. By the end, they sound like a train running out of track: “No you can’t come here,” Ramone sings, louder and gnarlier, before putting her foot down—“No! Cuz I’m a lonely girl.” It sounds like a breakdown, a tantrum, a moment of clarity—and then, as if nothing had happened, it fades into washed vocal melodies, and then into silence."

Here he's trying for something even more grand, but the trouble with big leaps is that they can come with precipitous drop-offs.","In 2010, George Lewis, Jr. released Forget, a small and evocative synth-pop record dotted with sense-memory details: ""Here’s all I know/ Your checkered room and your velvet bow/ Your Elvis song in my ear,"" he crooned. The record was a success, but Lewis seemed impatient with the smaller-scale stardom it brought, and made his hunger for bigger stages plain in interviews. On his 2012 follow-up Confess, he upped the stakes, projecting in a booming, testosterone-rich voice over massive pop-rock tracks. It was a self-consciously spectacular pop record, and it solidified Lewis as someone eager to make Big Statements.It’s easy to root for artists with this drive—the bedroom-to-stadium leap, when it goes right, is thrilling to witness, and major statements (and artists’ desires to make them) are a large part of what makes following music so worthwhile in the first place. The trouble with big leaps is that they can come with precipitous drop-offs, and on Eclipse Lewis plummets, hard, into a valley of deep ridiculousness.Lewis’s influences have always felt rooted in '80s pop radio, when thundering drum machines and vocal overdubs stormed the Earth. On Eclipse, the sound edges into the twilight of '88, a moment when power ballads like Chicago’s ""Look Away"" ruled the airwaves. The dewy piano of ""Alone"", coupled with Lewis’s echo-drenched vocal, summon unwelcome memories of Richard Marx’s ""Right Here Waiting"". As he did with Confess, Lewis produces, and on Eclipse he pushes everything so far to the brink that it all tips over. The album sounds like the work of Ron Nevison, whose late-'80s work for Damn Yankees and Jefferson Starship set a new standard for what it meant to sound ""overblown.""On Confess, Lewis gave us an outsized performance of masculinity that felt slippery, or at least self-aware, and a lot of that complexity lived in the dynamics. The choruses were massive, but the verses were taut and punchy, and the two worked in tandem. On Eclipse, that nuance is mostly erased, as is nearly any dynamic marking south of ffffffff. Most of the album is delivered in a triumphal shout. The chorus of ""To the Top"" punches the top of the mix so hard that there is almost nothing left to feel except stunned, and it carries a dangerous whiff of Dirk Diggler performing ""You’ve Got the Touch"".Lewis dials back the volume once or twice on Eclipse, and each time it’s a welcome reprieve. ""Old Love/New Love"" is a legitimately sexy, fluid dance-pop song, marked out with a side-chained four-to-the-floor pulse and house pianos. The big, blocky synths of ""When the Lights Turn Out"" are slightly reminiscent of '80s Jam & Lewis, and Lewis’s voice is light and pretty above them. It might have a slight whiff of aerobicizing to it, but it’s sincere, and it’s possible, if you squint, to imagine it playing alongside One Direction (a huge compliment, in this case).Playing next to One Direction is Lewis’s goal, and he is admirably focused and direct about it. ""I hate when people that are definitely in the indie world posture themselves as pop stars when they lack the ambition, practice, and craft of someone who is at the top of their game in pop,"" he told Pitchfork in January. His disdain is rooted in a competitive impulse to swim with the big fish—he has also submitted material for Chris Brown and Eminem—and Eclipse, which is also his first album on Warner Bros., is his bid to join them. But the music feels wedged between weight classes—too ridiculous to be indie rock and too ponderous and generic for Top 40 pop. Say this for Eclipse: It doesn’t miss by half measures."

Born and raised in New Zealand, the singer decamped to Australia in her late teens, launching the promising Melbourne rock band Teeth & Tongue several years later. Across four albums, Teeth & Tongue pivoted constantly, from snarling Bad Seeds blues to the velvet-gloved rock of Feist to synth-pop so cloying it seemed like a last cynical bid on careerism. After a decade stuck at the precipice of a breakthrough, Cornelius stepped away from Teeth & Tongue in 2017 to record five solo songs, all spare electric strums and soaring vibrato. That EP, Nothing Is Lost, felt at last like Cornelius’ real breakthrough—arching psalms of sadness and disappointment, rendered with the quiver and clarity of Angel Olsen. Her debut LP, the arresting Distance, suggests it was not another phase.Cornelius left Australia in 2018 for Los Angeles, where she began recording Distance in a series of studios with session bands that included members of the War on Drugs, Warpaint, and Woods. She brought her restlessness with her, and it animates these 10 songs, from the way she treats musical inspirations and reference points like quick trysts to her lyrical disinterest in monogamy or the mores of adulthood. In recent years, the tension between being a footloose touring musician and the social pressure to grow up compelled Cornelius to grapple with age and expectation. On Distance, she details difficult situations—miscarriages, breakups, affairs, pep talks for one—with tragicomic candor, looking less for sympathy than a way to work through the mess. “You’re lonely,” she sings at one point. “Oh, but ain’t you livin’?”Slipping in and out of musical guises with preternatural ease, Cornelius remains a chameleonic bandleader, as she was with Teeth & Tongue. She jabs back at some selfish prick with the punchy garage-rock of “Banging My Head” and floats through a languid R&B haze for “Easy for No One,” an ode to not finding some great meaning or purpose in growing up. The muted doo-wop of “Palm Trees” moves on a similar California breeze as Best Coast, a mode tailormade for Cornelius’ questions about what a new state of residence may do for her state of mind.Much of Distance hinges on some version of a rock band—even “Love and Low Self Esteem,” a barbed codependence critique that served as the centerpiece of Cornelius’ EP, gets fitted with walloping drums and howling organs. But Distance’s quiet, spare outlier is one of its most stunning moments. A duet for her wistful nylon-stringed guitar and Mary Lattimore’s pensive harp, “Born Again” conjures the candlelit majesty of Marissa Nadler or even Sandy Denny. Cornelius’ bracing voice suddenly sounds ancient and fading, rendering snapshots of her youth against a backdrop of feeling tired and worn by time. “One of these days, I’m going to be born again,” she briefly taunts, as though ready to maraud in search of lost youth."

Their debut album pulls together West African rhythms, twitchy beats, and the requisite layer of reverb.","Some records are defined by the time and place of their creation, but Young Magic's piecemeal approach has the opposite effect. It doesn't sound like it came from a certain somewhere, but rather everywhere. And it's a surprisingly cohesive work considering that it was recorded in several different countries and sutured together from singles and B-sides that have been around since 2010. So yeah, Melt-- that's a great word for Young Magic's debut, but ""blur,"" ""smear,"" or ""dissolve"" would also be acceptable.I suppose it goes without saying that Melt might inadvertently align itself with hyphenated genres many of you are looking to conscientiously avoid. It's a reductive, but not completely off-base, assumption. Sure, these tracks are underpinned by West African rhythms (""The Dancer""), Brainfeeder's non-quantized drum smacks (""Sanctuary""), and the stutters of dubstep (""Drawing Down the Moon""). But for all of the trio's globe-trotting origins (two are Australian ex-pats, one is a native Indonesian, and all have traveled to multiple continents), there's an introversion and physical distance which bring to mind kids looking for the perfect beat while hunched over samplers and laptops in their apartments.But while the reverb is ample and the edges are soft, it's a choice more functional than fashionable, a conscious production decision to solder together disparate sounds into a textured whole. The rare times they're present, guitars are tremeloed and processed to sound like balalaikas as opposed to chorded instruments, and while the melodies are often pumped out by harsh, exaggerated synths, the percussion most often takes the tone of household objects-- rattling coins on ""Sparkly"", pitched water jugs on ""Slip Time"", alarm clocks and cell phones elsewhere.It's a cushy listen, if not only always distinctive, particularly since the shorter tracks often amount to a cooled, deep-blue gelatin that holds the previously released singles together. But those three tracks instantly stand out less because of their familiarity and more because it's where Young Magic really leans into the listener rather than kicking back. Aggression isn't really their game, so the chain-gang lurch of ""Sparkly"" effectively starts Melt on a slowly menacing opening note, while the warped war chant of ""You With Air"" undergoes subtle digital damage that gives it tonal ambivalence. The centerpiece ""Night in the Ocean"" has a fairly self-explanatory title, but an accurate one-- at once pulverizing and pristine, it's an HD stunner amidst mostly Hipstamatic surrounding. These are also the best showcases for the interplay of Young Magic's vocalists: Melati Malay's coo flutters and glides as more of a shoegazey texture than a vessel for communication, and while certainly not as pretty, Isaac Emmanuel has something of a wounded half-rap that's ultimately more distinctive. Particularly when they trade off stoned mutters and airy ecstasy on ""Night in the Ocean"", you could imagine Salem, had they formed during the best semester abroad ever.But Melt can just as easily be seen as pragmatic, offering solutions to questions left unanswered by some of the more disappointing trajectories taken by fellow indie psych travelers who once called NYC home: Are you a Yeasayer fan who instantly felt buyer's remorse the moment ""The Children"" introduced the wonky electro boondoggle Odd Blood? Wished High Places still sounded as, well, high as they did on their EPs? Just wanna see Here We Go Magic underwater? Melt has got your back. But those comparisons are every bit as useful for contrast-- you could get a sense of these bands' personalities beyond the manner in which they arranged their sounds, and it's tougher to parse what Young Magic have to say. Are Young Magic hippies? Naive adventurers? Shut-ins obsessed with looping pedals? Melt conjures these admirable comparisons while avoiding any sort of concrete answer, but ultimately Young Magic can aspire to more by letting us know where they're coming from in a figurative sense."

A significant break from Jamie Lidell's prior work both as a solo laptop artist on Warp and as one half of Super_Collider (Chilean techno terrorist Christian Vogel carries the other half of that amulet), its breezy soul had me dreaming up back stories. Maybe these were all guest vocalists. Maybe Warp's promobot purposely mislabelled some old Stax record to put me off the scent. Maybe Lidell did some Logic voodoo on a vault of old soul reels and repurposed a bunch of lesser-heard Motown gems to fit a glitchier, Warp-friendly palette.The real answer was simpler than that. Nearly five years in the making, Multiply represents Lidell's dramatic transformation from a knob-twiddling laptopper to a red-blooded soul singer. Where Lidell's prior solo work enjoyed a well-earned reputation for being difficult and forbidding, Multiply is among the most accessible records Warp has ever released. Backed by instrumentation from the likes of Berlinite squatters such as Mocky and Gonzales, and fleshed out by Lidell's robust, full-bodied voice, Multiply has the spirit of classic Motown and Stax. Whether in the breezy, sun-drenched title track, the soulful creep of ""This Time"" or the closing ballad ""Game For Fools"", it's obvious that Lidell isn't afraid of channeling (or repeating) history.But while the song structures and Lidell's vocal style owe boatloads to the 60s and 70s, there's also a modern programming style at work here that separates him from modern day revivalists like, say, Sharon Jones. Listen to Multiply once and you'll be struck by how reverent it is; listen to it three times and you'll start to notice the microscopic digital artifacts and subtle tweaks that give it personality and pop. For all the talk about it being a throwback record, it's also true that a handful of these tracks probably couldn't have been made in 1995, much less '65. The wet funk of first single ""When I Come Around"" takes glitchy liberties with its percussion track and includes a stunning middle-8 where Lidell's vocal gets chopped, sliced and sprinkled over a merry-go-round; the goofy ""A Little Bit More"" sounds like nu-soul run through a slapstick plugin; the delirious funk of ""Newme"" is a nine-layer cake of boom-bap, Rhodes and horns, about six levels of which had to have been built after the fact, in the studio, on a computer.Anyway, if the Maximo Park record wasn't enough to signify the end of days for the Warp of old, this should do the trick. Not just because it's one of the label's most commercially viable releases in forever, but because it goes to great lengths to lovingly namecheck the very strands of soul (i.e. Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder, etc.) that the old Warp very fastidiously avoided. While I'm not sure that people have as strong a sense of brand loyalty to Warp anymore, this is probably still going to go down in electronic music circles as one of the year's most polarizing records. But don't let the naysayers keep you from hearing this before the winter rolls around; boasting 10 gorgeous songs over a trim 40 minutes, this is exactly the kind of record you need in your summer."

He’s just finished a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and blood crawls down the side of his bandaged nose, threatening to drip onto his suit. As the audience cheers, Abel Tesfaye walks backstage, his artificial smile intact, until he reaches a hallway where it fades into a frigid stare.The character he plays is an exaggerated riff on the solipsistic-hedonist persona Tesfaye has been tunneling into since his 2011 mixtape trilogy, where he first introduced listeners to his brand of brooding nihilism. In 2020, he continues to revel in high drama; After Hours dives deep into the textures of pleasure, despair, and how we consciously distance ourselves from our interiors.After years of attempting to bring the spectral tones of his early mixtapes to a mainstream pop format, Tesfaye finally unites his two worlds. His major-label debut Kiss Land was a languid disappointment, and Beauty Behind the Madness failed to live up to the promise made by the Trilogy tapes. After Hours delivers on the most compelling aspects of Tesfaye’s vision; leveraging a self-loathing villain into an irresistible, cinematic narrative with his most satisfying collision of new wave, dream pop, and R&B.Even if he is singing about the same things—bacchanalian excess, loneliness as rapture, using women to rehabilitate his poor little life—the fresh vocals and production flourishes do the trick. On “Too Late,” his longtime producer Illangelo (alongside Lizzo producer Ricky Reed and DaHeala) mutate UK garage’s syncopated kicks and pitch-shifted echoes, drawing on the spirit of My Dear Melancholy,’s “Wasted Times.” “Hardest to Love” couples a sharp jungle break with Tesfaye’s longing whispers about remorse and a troubled partnership. Oneohtrix Point Never and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker also lend production on “Repeat After Me (Interlude)” a collage of psychedelic wooshes and Vocoder dubs, while the ghostly eulogy “Until I Bleed Out” uses liturgical synth arpeggios reminiscent of “Boring Angel” from OPN’s R Plus Seven.There’s always been a cinematic flair to Tesfaye’s music, as if he’s been chasing after his own Purple Rain moment—for now, he’ll have to settle for a cameo in the Safdie Brothers’ 2019 thriller Uncut Gems. He draws on synth-pop nostalgia to mirror the tragic glitz of ’80s Hollywood: “In Your Eyes” includes an arena-sized cheeseball sax solo, while the plinking synths and slick hand-claps of “Save Your Tears” evoke a long-lost Wham! track. Tesfaye can lean a little too hard on these Reagan-era signifiers, but his bleeding-heart melodies and donating an unforgettable hook to the synth player on “Blinding Lights” remind us why we keep listening in the first place."

She draws on dancehall, Miami bass, and trap, with enough space to breathe and glitter.","After Hours opens like a dream sequence. Seagulls circle the sky, waves crash onto empty beaches. A crackly police scanner reveals a cop and dispatcher discussing arrests. It’s hard to tell if it’s dusk or dawn; twilight tends to warp time. But these are the protean hours that a certain set live for and that Jubilee recreates on After Hours. Where other dance albums often focus on just the club, for Jubilee, everything before, after, and in between is just as important.On her long-awaited debut full-length, the Miami-born, Manhattan-based DJ and producer née Jessica Gentile pays tribute to the nightlife that raised her. Influenced by countless drives through Miami, the LP takes on a breezy, balmy feel different from Jubilee’s past Mixpak releases. Where her last three EPs (Pull Ova, Jealous, and JMZ Riddim) were harder and more percussive, After Hours is dreamier and more melodic. She still draws on many of the sounds she’s known for—dancehall, Miami bass, trap, among others—but this time, her music is concerned not just with the immediate moment but also with reflections on past ones.Each track stands as its own memory and its own vignette, but as memories are wont to do, the edges bleed together, so that After Hours also functions like a 38-minute, South Florida-obsessed club mix. On “Stingray Shuffle,” Jubilee playfully references the shuffle that beachgoers do to avoid getting stung in shallow waters. A prickly, arpeggiated motif dances across a pounding beat, reminiscent of Frankie Knuckles’ “Your Love,” except faster and with a Detroit techno nod to DJ Stingray. “Sawgrass Expressway,” named after the expressway that runs through Broward County where Gentile grew up, also draws on house and techno, but with a sparser, more robotic feel. Both tracks are made for the club, but here they suggest spaces outside of it—getting ready beforehand, or barreling down an open road after.At the club proper, lead single “Wine Up” is a dancehall jam with a chutney soca feel, by way of synthesized dhantal rhythms. A repeating four-note motif gestures toward Gyptian’s “Hold Yuh,” while Bronx-based dancehall artist Hoodcelebrityy demands the room, to “Wine up gyal, w-wine up yuh body!/Wine up gyal, r-r-ride di riddim!” Similarly, on “Bass Supply,” Miami mischief-maker Otto Von Schirach raps, “Swing that ass, swing it round and round!/Pound that shit, on the fucking ground!” Jubilee, meanwhile, interpolates the Miami bass track with an array of effects that she triggers as if playing Bop It—water droplets, slide whistles, unruly springs, 808 cowbells.All throughout, Jubilee builds a consistent sense of place, shaping a loose narrative. In some ways, the album pivots on the track “JMZ Interlude,” which finds the listener ejected abruptly from the bawdy world of Von Schirach into the busy city streets. Using her 2014 Brooklyn-inspired “JMZ Riddim,” the interlude sketches the familiar scenario of trying to catch a ride to the next spot. Exclamations of “Brooklyn bruk!” cut through the cacophony of honking cars and blaring sirens. By the time the car doors slam shut, a slightly off-kilter stop/walk light starts ticking for what feels like forever. Finally, the ambient “Snooze Button” ushers in a brief daydream and some relief. At least, that’s one interpretation. The narrative arc of the album isn’t entirely clear-cut. But then again, neither are many nights out.Either way, there’s no denying that After Hours is a meticulously produced affair. Every bass line and syncopated rhythm and subtle inflection fits precisely one into the other. Yet it always maintains enough space to breathe and, very often, to glitter: the same prickly pattern we first hear on “Stingray Shuffle” recurs throughout the record, shape-shifting just so to evoke different images and moods. On “Opa-Locka,” an homage to the city just south of Broward County, bells twinkle like stars over a spry reggae rhythm. The atmospheric “Spa Day” feels like speeding past the ocean, with the sun glinting off its corrugated surface. A slow-winding kizomba groove anchors the track, and 909 toms bounce from one side of the listener’s sonic periphery to the other as bits of conversation float by.By the end, on album closer “Beach Ball,” swells of ambient noise rise and fall like columns of warm air, buoying bobbing flutes and skittering hi-hats. The tiniest gleam of morning light stains the horizon, easily blotting out any memory of police dispatchers or hungry gulls. Waves lap gently against the shore, and we feel it in our lungs: that these are the hours we live for."

It's become something of a minor cult classic; with a Gucci-sampling hook and a beat that is basically just a loop of Robert Miles' trance song ""Children"", ""Rollin'"" still doesn't sound like any other dance music/hip-hop blend, because its goal was not to operate as functional dance music in any capacity. Compared with the four-on-the-floor Guetta sound common today, Block Beattaz had laced Jackie with a track that emulated ecstasy's emotional rush while leaving the dancing to someone else.Jackie's latest tape with DJ Nick Catchdubs, After Hours, follows a similar formula. Despite the frequent references to club sounds new and old, the tape is closer in function to the Beatnuts' brand of ignorant party-rap than to Pitbull or Flo Rida. Instead of sampling the dance music of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, though, this music draws on sample sources that rose in the wake of the rave. What helps make this release work is that it studiously avoids being just a club record; it simply references club records. ""Moving"" runs off of a sample that was everywhere the past few years; Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" was transformed into trance by Avicii, which was in turn remixed by Skrillex and played everywhere; shortly afterward, Flo Rida borrowed the same vocal sample. But Jackie's version actually uses Pretty Lights ""Finally Moving"", which is primarily lounge-esque trip-hop, not functional club music.To keep this interesting, it helps that Catchdubs has given him a wealth of clever and unexpected reference points; there are obvious novelty club samples from Scatman John's ""I'm a Scatman"". The album's climax is ""Molly"", an ode to the ubiquitous ecstasy pill with a euphoric saxophone sample swiped directly from Guido's ""Mad Sax"". There are exceptions, but-- thanks in part to Catchdubs' excellent work sequencing the record-- they end up feeling like a part of the overall ebb and flow. It's doubtful that DJ Burn One-- a largely traditionalist ""southern rap tunes"" advocate-- planned that his ""Don't Violate"" production would provoke the overwhelming nausea of a bad trip, but that's effectively its role on the tape.One of the things that keeps the record relentlessly entertaining, of course, is Jackie Chain himself. He's a completely one-dimensional personality, which is perfect; it's a performance of party-rap ignorance with few peers, and his distinctive, shouted, caps-lock flow is the perfect blunt object to effectively convey raw ego. Not that the record is one-note; it manages to capture a wide range of variations on the partying theme. It's just that Jackie's role is to be the same consistent hardhead throughout. His character has no flaws or vulnerabilities; he's simply a partying everyman, his only motivations drugs, booze, money, and women. No one likes thinking about the consequences of stupid behavior, and that's exactly what Jackie Chain is offering: consequence-free hedonism in exactly the right setting."

Charles Speer curtain-- most often speaks from a six-Buds-to-the-wind perspective.","After Hours rolls in, alt-country flags flying: opener ""Fossilized"" boasts some two-chord strum and pick, a rutted-road rhythm, honky-tonk ivories, even the thick thud of cowbell. And in his lugubrious baritone, Dave Shuford-- the man behind the D. Charles Speer curtain-- lays out a litany of boilerplate woes: broken relationship, stalled career, the general suckiness of growing older and an inch closer to feeling obsolete. From a six-Buds-to-the-wind perspective, he tells a woman who used to come to his shows but doesn't anymore: ""These days I see you'd rather be set on fire/ Than to be a part of the attending choir/ But I don't really mind"".These genre markers, however, are posted on what turns out to be a garden path. Two verses in, guitars whinny, drums stumble, and amps froth at the mouth, as ""Fossilized"" spasms seizure-style, and Shuford and backing band the Helix collectively lose their shit in a brief psychedelic breakdown.Limning the country/psych membrane isn't a particularly novel strategy, of course. From the cross-pollinating Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and adjacent artistic circles of the 1960s and 70s, to the cowpunk and psychobilly scenes of the 80s and 90s, to today's robust indie-country landscape, the curious crossroads of backwoods and inner eye always seems to draw its share of pilgrims. Many of the hybrid's recent strains-- gothic Americana, in particular-- offer willfully weird, self-conscious genre-bending performances that verge on camp. But on their second record after 2007's more folk-identified Some Forgotten Country, Speer and the Helix take a page from the past and play it straight up. Kind of.After Hours' bounty of drinking songs for down-and-outers-- ""Drink Up and Go Home"", the title track, and the band's cover of Gary Stewart's desolate ""Single Again""-- proclaims its genuine, irony-free affection for twang and scant patience for artifice. When damp creeps through After Hours' floorboards and stuff on the walls slips askew, they come off as reasonably organic developments. The droning-veering-into-abstract ""Sit Right There"" imagines the Greek bouzoukis as a historically accurate fixture of the Appalachian folk tradition. ""Canaanite Builder"" is convincingly fire-and-brimstone, as Shuford drawls jumbled Old Testament verse and draws vivid grotesquerie (shrunken heads, severed feet) to menacing, heavy-bottomed grooves. ""Past or Beyond"" is a schizophrenic style parade of whiplashed time signature shifts that hints at band members' avant-garde backstories in taxonomizing-resistant acts No Neck Blues Band and Sunburned Hand of the Man.But even when it shares more with No Wave than No Depression, After Hours makes you think that maybe the odd stuff was buried in the ancient songs all along. And here's where the ""old, weird America"" is typically invoked. Nine times out of 10, the phrase Greil Marcus made famous is utterly inapplicable. However, D. Charles Speer's hidden-in-plain-sight aesthetic, its facility for making the familiar strange (and deserving of closer scrutiny) is exactly what Marcus was on about when he pointed in wonder at ""the mystical body of the republic, a kind of public secret...a declaration of a weird but clearly recognizable America within the America of the exercise of institutional majoritarian power."" So shine a light, lift a rock: this weird secret deserves to be known."

As long as a functional definition of “dream pop” exists, its adherents looking to opt out of reality will find Gemini to be a readily accessible escape hatch. But in the time since, Tatum appears to be the only guy who’s taken the message of “Live in Dreams” literally: Indigo opener “Letting Go” is basically a rewrite of 2010’s “Golden Haze,” and the lo-fi limitations of his early solo set-up—synth-string drizzles, low-res drum-machine patter, and fuzzy evocations of transcendent romance—have all been replaced by the real thing. In all senses, Tatum’s fourth LP is his “Los Angeles” album: It presents him as another New York indie-rock transplant flipping LA’s “Welcome to the Jungle” stereotype and relocating after becoming successful, settling down, and starting to say “synergy.” In other words, living the dream.Indigo takes Wild Nothing to places Tatum likely couldn’t have imagined from his Virginia Tech dorm. Whereas Gemini earned an honorary induction in the lineage of UK indie-pop shut-ins, the wave-running acoustic guitars on “Oscillation” merge with a string section to recall the lavishly produced and largely anonymous Brit-rock acts that emerged to fill the post-Kid A void. “Partners in Motion” sways to a Balearic breeze, saxes blare from the lido deck on “Through Windows,” and “The Closest Thing to Living” recalls not just the sound of Hounds of Love but also a budget big enough to earmark a Fairlight. Tatum co-produced Indigo with Jorge Elbrecht, a guy whose recent resume includes the most polished Ariel Pink, Japanese Breakfast, and Frankie Rose albums to date—the guy knows how to give former bedroom acts a stylish redesign worthy of Dwell: aspirational and accessible.Yet Tatum himself can’t tie the room together. Just about everything on Indigo serves as a testament to both Tatum’s increasing facility in the studio and his limitations as an actual frontman. This wasn’t an issue on Gemini or Nocturne because Tatum didn’t make it one: His gauzy, glimmering guitars set a mood where you could follow his prompts about Heather or running away with clouds in your eyes or whatever to blot out whatever mundane bullshit was keeping you from your daydreams. In 2012, Tatum even admitted, “I don’t place too much importance on words… I didn’t try and say anything terribly meaningful.” His position in that regard has evolved as well, as Indigo sorta-kinda dabbles in Being Extremely Online—phrases like “heartbreak 2.0,” “swiping through the headlines,” “when I look at you, it’s a screen turned blue,” and “the age of detachment” all roll past like matter-of-fact tweets from your Sorta Online friend, favorited out of obligation. He notices these things, but does he really care about them? Hell, why should we?"

After that, the Toronto producer and singer/songwriter Tommy Paxton-Beesley started appearing everywhere, collaborating with BADBADNOTGOOD (credited as a cellist on what might one of their best songs “CS60”), Kaytranada, Freddie Gibbs, Mac Miller, and Pusha T. A few weeks ago on Beats 1 Radio, before Zane Lowe played a River Tiber song featuring Kaytranada and Pusha T, he said “I don’t even know what is going on in Toronto right now, but I know that the music sounds like the city looks.” It’s a strange statement on it’s face. What does Toronto look like? On an architectural level, the city is notoriously brutalist and disquietingly postmodern, filled with imposing and amorphous grey concrete and anonymous skyscrapers. Standing from his perch on CN Tower, Drake (aka rap game Jon Stark), the King of the North expresses all the wistful aesthetic those kind of buildings exude. But then demographically it’s incredibly heterogeneous, even for a city on the eastern seaboard, rivaling, if not beating out New York in terms of diversity. Which makes its mix of genres an incredibly interesting melting pot.So when Zane Lowe talks about the music and the look of Toronto being symmetrical or at least related, what are you supposed to conjure up? If there is any signature sound that is popular in Toronto right now, it’s a melancholic and atmospheric R&B centered around parties gone sour, vape batteries gone dead, and text messages from an ex, from dvsn to Charlotte Day Wilson to Alessia Cara. On his debut album, *Indigo, *Tommy Paxton-Beesley takes a deep swig of that syrup, delivering what is probably one of the best representations of a regional vernacular that keeps getting more and more interesting.*Indigo *opens up with the “Genesis,” a very loud but perhaps overly ambitious statement song that mimics all the grandeur of James Blake’s Overgrown. It has the feeling and warble of a UFO tractor beam, slowing pulling up a man into unknown. It’s also a good litmus test for what to expect from the record’s rather eclectic combination of instruments. Beesley creates a chilly yet undeniably organic environment from a strange combination of cello, violin, tuba, trombone, percussion, synth, a Rhodes organ, guitar and his own heavily processed voice. “Genesis” is like a good night at a bar, perfectly crowded, but leaves room for chance, and ends just when you want it."

Steady, powerful torque is what he does best. Who knows why he went off the rails, playing against his own strengths as well as the needs of the music. Perhaps the well-known Arcade Fire sideman and solo auteur felt pressure to adapt to this very jazz context. Perhaps he wanted to show that he can also roam free, contrary to his reputation as a blinkered marathoner. Or maybe it just worked out that way in the moment.

But I can still imagine a tantalizing version of this collaboration where Stetson owns his lane, laying down a winding labyrinth of cool stone, and lets Gustafsson play the snorting, bucking Minotaur, a role that comes naturally to him."

It’s a concept album whose concept is: What if Paris Hilton made an album?,"Picture it: You’re standing in the outdoor area of a bar, elbow-to-elbow with your fellow revelers. As it used to be, the proximity is perfectly safe. You aren’t even thinking about it. The temperature is perfect: 75 or 82 or 90, whatever you like. You’re having such a good time, you don’t even realize it—inoculated by the privilege of being able to take such things for granted. Whatever song is playing—you weren’t paying much attention to it—ends and the vague reggae intro of Paris Hilton’s Top 20 hit from 2006, “Stars Are Blind,” slinks on. Now you’re paying attention. The night’s sparkle brightens.The communal experience of a beloved pop song from yesteryear sounds so good right now. If you have any relationship with “Stars Are Blind,” the new vinyl reissue of Hilton’s first and, to date, only album might be the perfect serving of nostalgic comfort food. Go ahead and indulge: Pop music is a salve that can provide a respite from fixating on doom and even transcend the politics of its own creators. So, in the spirit of eating the rich—and looking back lovingly at any time other than the present—Paris is both an easy thing to tear into and a hard thing to deny. It is goofy and craven, ear candy and rotted commodity. It’s so simplistic that it could make you swear it’s a put-on, that it’s way savvier than it seems, that it’s so stridently bereft of having any there there that it must be intentional. “There,” Hilton mutters into your ears and smacks you over the head with maroon-and-blonde marbled vinyl containing an amalgamation of mid-aughts pop.At the time of its release, Paris seemed like a lark—a trifling vanity project from someone who was making a mint off of merely existing. Deadpan and clipped, Hilton didn’t seem even particularly engaged or enthusiastic about doing that. Already a tabloid staple, reality TV star, and absorber of paparazzi flashbulbs, Hilton was trying on pop stardom like a new pair of Louboutins that she’d soon discard. Little did we know that a reggae rip-off of Lord Creator’s 1970 cut “Kingston Town” would become the most enduring relic of her public reign. It couldn’t be anything else. It’s not like people are going to turn to her memoir Confessions of an Heiress, or one of her box-office bombs (The Hottie and the Nottie, anyone?), or DreamCatchers hair extensions to remember Hilton’s heyday by. For all the space Hilton sucked up and never gave anything of substance back to, “Stars Are Blind,” made it sort of worth it."

Paired with hazy production, his diaristic words of self-reflection and self-deprecation ring out loud. The London-based singer, rapper, and producer has a knack for vivid storytelling on emotional despair and introspection that serves as makeshift therapy sessions. GLOW, his second project, centers the anticipation and fear of unlocking one’s own potential. This intimate collection of avant-R&B songs wallows in growing pains, embracing late-night anxieties of not feeling good enough for anyone, least of all yourself. Across the record, Joseph airs stream-of-consciousness musings on fear and hopelessness with apparent ease and warmth, sounding like he’s ready to welcome the confidence to overcome. He first established that vision as a founding member of Birmingham musical collective OG Horse, which also included childhood friend and fellow singer Jorja Smith. In 2016, the Walsall-raised artist moved to London to study film. His 2021 debut, ULTRAMARINE, was soulful and upbeat, but relied heavily on cinematic aesthetics that left its themes of loneliness and longing feeling boring. GLOW is far more evolved.Throughout the project, Joseph’s music evokes a mix of Pip Millett’s gritty neo-soul, Blood Orange’s colorful textural exploration, and SAULT’s funk-inspired melodies. His songs translate deep feelings into futuristic pop and R&B that sounds as sinister as it is grandiose. The project opens with its title track, a five-minute emotional goliath that dissects Joseph’s inner turmoil and desire to be perceived: “How do you see me/When you glow so bright/So bright?” he repeats in a melancholic tone over moody, blue-lit strings. What happens when dark thoughts are so ubiquitous that standing in the light feels like a distant dream? On “I Just Know Highs,” a Leon Vynehall-produced track that twists Joseph’s eerily Auto-Tuned vocals into a flute instrumental, Joseph examines the personal lows that paradoxically make him feel most alive: “I’m lost out my mind/Well, most of my mind/If I look down I’m dying, or maybe I’m flying,” he croons. On “Cold Summer,” he juxtaposes optimistic bars on moving past self-deprecation against wistful strings that bring the emotional work within reach. GLOW sags at “25,” where Joseph’s personal stocktaking is stunted by a vague and repetitive wish to find “a different side of me.” The song ends abruptly before we find out which side that might be.It’s the album’s least interesting moment, but the missed opportunity doesn’t overwhelm the breadth of Joseph’s skill to delineate his feelings in a way that evokes comfort and reflection. With GLOW, Joseph underlines the often scary process of uncovering insecurities with a sense of reassurance that suggests your own introspective forays could be just as rewarding. What lies on the other side of fear? GLOW’s warm and encouraging approach to finding the answers makes for a stellar introduction to a multidisciplinary artist dedicated to conquering his own limits.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

The arrow of our days no longer flies true; it moves more like a crinkled paper plane—soaring briefly, plunging without notice, skidding gracelessly sideways across the floor. Sometimes it seems almost to loop backward. The London producer patten’s GLOW, recorded entirely during the UK’s lockdown, is propelled by this elastic timekeeping and steeped in the uneasy mood of the day. Created using a relatively stripped-down palette of synthesizers, it features almost no drums but could not quite be called ambient. It is restless in places and directionless in others; the mood is emotionally numb, except when it is sullen. Sometimes it is even a little boring, but not in an unpleasant way. Like a ticking clock in a quiet room, its blankness is the sort that leads the mind to wander. And the chance to wander, these days, is to be prized.The absence of beats marks a notable shift for patten. On early albums like 2011’s GLAQJO XAACSSO and 2014’s ESTOILE NAIANT, which kicked off a brief tenure on Warp, he harnessed a welter of hyper-compressed, low-bitrate sounds and squished them into a lumpy sort of beat music: Imagine a fistful of lossy YouTube rips fed through a Play-Doh noodle maker. Last year’s Flex took a step away from the psychedelic murk of those albums, incorporating the icy clarity of trap and grime along with some of the brawn of breakbeat-driven bass music. The results often sounded less original—and less interesting—than his foundational work. But with GLOW, patten reconnects with the fundamental sense of strangeness that has run through his best music, even without the tangled rhythms and messy textures that once were his stock in trade.On most of GLOW’s 14 tracks, patten plays his cards close to his chest. Each song is made up of a slim handful of moving parts that tend to spin slowly and aimlessly in place; loops trundle along in parallel, patterns stumbling almost imperceptibly. These sequences and arpeggios sound less like impeccably executed digital commands than the product of fingers idly drumming against the keys, the musician half-asleep in the studio chair, deep into the small hours of the night. There are no big emotional payoffs; most tracks just play out until they don’t anymore. In “Clandestine Modal,” distortion gradually creeps across an expanse of airy synths, covering them in fuzz, like mold consuming a piece of fruit. “Screen Burn,” mostly just heavy pads and buzzing FM bass, spins like a leaden mobile in thick, humid air. “Rorschach” suggests the theme from The Exorcist played on kalimba and run through dub delay, underscoring the anxious, horror-film mood that lies just below the album’s surface."

Guests include Nile Rodgers and Jamie Lidell.","Marco Niemerski's 2006 debut single was called ""Around the House"" and the title sums up the German producer's career as Tensnake. He's occasionally experimented with sounds from other genres—electro's searing synth lines, beachy balearic tempos, expansive space disco—but he's always returned to house's straightforward pulse, both with his original productions and as a DJ. Reliability has been Niemerski's calling card but his best material comes when he steps out of his comfort zone. He had a minor blog-crossover hit with 2010's Soul II Soul-jacking remix of defunct Toronto house ragamuffins Azari & III's ""Reckless With Your Love"". That year also brought ""Coma Cat"", a classic slice of 1980s-redolent house music on blissed-out dance hub Permanent Vacation that paired textural intensity with a melody that was a serious earworm.It's been nearly four years since ""Coma Cat"" and Niemerski has remained reliable, so Glow seeks to both capitalize on that rep and introduce him to a larger audience—it's not only is it his debut album, it's also his first time on a major. Successful dance full-lengths generally take one of two approaches: a statement of purpose separate from the creator’s established style or a collection of existing singles, rounded up as a primer for newcomers. Glow goes in a different direction, offering a streamlined, sanitized version of the Tensnake sound. It's house music in miniature form, heavily brushed with disco's steady-handed bounce and tempered with just enough potential pop-crossover appeal. Niemerski generally works best with room to stretch, as his best productions typically land around the seven-minute mark. A brief glance at the running time of Glow's individual songs—only one pushes the six-minute mark, while most clock in at three-and-a-half—suggests that he compromised his vision to accommodate a larger stage.Much of the album finds Niemerski collaborating with Berlin vocalist Fiora, a capable singer whose unshowy qualities makes her both malleable and forgettable; save for ""See Right Through"", a moody cut that's made the rounds over the past year, Fiora's presence feels more like a placeholder, a paperweight meant to anchor the barely-sketched house figures. Niemerski's collaborations with other artists fare worse; the stale ""Pressure"", a disco workout featuring vocalist Thabo, never capitalizes on its propulsive build, while ""Feel of Love"", a team-up with Jamie Lidell and space cadet Stuart Price in his Jacques Lu Cont alias, is a jagged, off-putting synth-pop tune that resembles the many low points of Lidell's self-titled LP from last year.Many of Glow's songs are just-there, but a few manage to be engaging: ""No Relief"", ""See Right Through"", and ""No Colour"" are perfect examples of Niemerski's still-considerable talent with house form. The latter two tunes made memorable appearances on his Essential Mix, confirming that he's most in his zone when dreaming of the dancefloor. The appropriately slow ""58 BPM"" is a lush, swarming synth-pop tune that serves as the album's strongest vocal cut, while album bookends ""First Song"" and ""Last Song"" play around with pop-focused drone while embracing the type of epic beams found in M83's music (or, Random Access Memories' own jet-engine closer, ""Horizon"").Both ""First Song"" and ""Last Song"" suggest that Niemerski may have had a more focused album experience in mind, but it never had a chance given the record's scattershot approach. Given its release on a high-profile label, as well as recent shifts in mainstream dance culture, it's possible to look at Glow more cynically. Michaelangelo Matos recently described Niemerski's Astralwerks signing as the latest example of the EDM cash-grab still raging on in North America. But the album is so slight, it’ll be easy to forget it exists and hope that Tensnake's next full-length won't sound so uninspired."

Eight years later, his new Glow retains the same question but shifts its target-- not to Jackson's absence, but to the diminishing returns he brought with him when that absence ended.","In case you forgot, Smash still has jams for days. When Jackson Fourgeaud released his 2005 debut album as Jackson and His Computer Band after years of prodigious singles and hot-stove development, it was a delirious tangle of ideas that just got messier the more you tried to pull it apart. It was an agile mixture of glitch, electro, left-field hip-hop and early French Touch that was less a blend than a collision. Everything sounded like a remix of a remix of a remix of a seventh draft, the odd paradox of something so fussed over that it shuddered into chaos as some kind of survival mechanism. Yet you could still move to it despite its apparent disinterest in locking into an easy-fit groove. That his public work post-Smash was limited to a string of remixes by electro/house acts that could be considered his less-outlandish usurprers-- Justice (“D.A.N.C.E.”), Kavinsky (“Pacific Coast Highway”), Planningtorock (“Living It Out”) -- seemed, for a while, like one of dance music's more perplexing mysteries. What the hell happened to him?Eight years later, Glow retains the same question but shifts its target-- not to Jackson's absence, but to the diminishing returns he brought with him when that absence ended. If there's one overarching flaw to Glow that covers all the little accumulated ones, it's that Jackson's genre-pastiche seams are starting to show a bit more. Instead of hacking pieces away from a solid block of beats to create something jagged and slippery to grasp, he comes up with a riff or a figure-- something easily identifiable as neo-new wave or caricaturized electro or half-hearted gabber-- and scuffs the surface a bit so it looks dingy. Not enough to be challenging or do anything surprising with its corrosion, but enough that it makes it difficult for his production to breather.Worse still, it feels like he's spent so much time pulling remix duty that he can only find ways to channel his own sound through other artists' work. “Orgysteria” and its cheesily grandiose android-love ooze is a few Hz short of Air's 10,000. “Dead Living Things” is the mushroomy analog sludge of Black Moth Super Rainbow with an ill-advised Random Access Memories budget and a nasal falsetto whine that could use a dirtier filter or three. And the aluminum-rattling haunted house throb of “Pump” takes the giallo sensibilties of Justice's † and waters its art-horror aspirations down to third-rate direct-to-VHS splatter.It gets worse. The unpleasant surprise of “G.I. Jane (Fill Me Up)”-- where gastric hoovers fill in for power chords, mock-Phoenix backbeats tick away rotely, and vocals are handled by a choir of distracted Mark Knopfler A.I.s-- doesn't work as either a sendup of arena indie or an embrace of it. And overdriven opener “Blow” and late-album churner “More” try to punk it up with quirky noise and noisy quirk, but can't stay focused long enough to keep their dopey momentum going before beatless interjections of droning synths let all the air out. Eclecticism and unpredictability used to be what made Jackson's work so exciting. But it's gotten so out of control that even the bits that almost work (“Seal” as bass-music flirtation; the swooning, dreamlike synthpop of the Classixx-ist “Vista”) still fail to come across integral threads in a new phase of his style. Instead, they feel like the pieces that stuck to the wall when he threw everything at it. I don't envy whoever has to clean up that mess."

Heems is a rapper (and former member of Das Racist) of Indian descent, though his family has roots in Pakistan. Riz is a rapper (and actor increasingly known for his role in HBO's “The Night Of”) of Pakistani descent whose family history can be traced back over the Indian side of the border. Heems hails from Queens, Riz from London. Heems is sharp-witted but raps with a relaxed cadence while Riz spits in the pointed, rapid-fire bursts that characterize grime. The two MCs make for a formidable pair on record, complimenting each other sonically while seeking out the overlap between their perspectives.After testing out their chemistry on a four song EP, Heems and Riz have now committed to the Swet Shop Boys project with the full-length Cashmere. Unlike the Swet Shop EP, which enlisted production from Ryan Hemsworth, Lushlife, and others, Cashmere was entirely helmed by London-based producer Redinho. In keeping with the EP’s sound, Redinho constructs propulsive beats from South Asian samples, providing ample fodder over which the Boys trade verses. Clocking in at just 34 minutes, Cashmere is more focused and consistent than any solo release from either rapper. In the push and pull between their styles, they find a compelling balance between hip-hop and agitprop, arriving at songs that are as enjoyable as they are thought-provoking.Lead single and opener “T5” offers a representative sample: over a screeching shehnai and heavy 808 thuds, the duo catalog the hassles of traveling while brown, skewer euphemistic security speak and situate themselves within the South Asian diaspora (“I run the city like my name’s Sadiq”). “No Fly List” builds a slinky banger around Heems’ hilarious flex, “I’m so fly, bitch/But I’m on a no fly list.” “Shottin” weaves tales about the NYPD’s surveillance of mosques using the time-tested format of true crime boom-bap. Only the goofy club number “Tiger Hologram” really falls flat, feeling like an inside joke we’re not privy to and featuring an entire verse where Heems raps with a comical lack of effort—about as funny as salt in a wound to anyone who’s continued to root for him post-Das Racist. While there are a few moments like this on Cashmere, the hungrier Riz usually picks up the slack. And when Heems does show up on these tracks, he sounds effortlessly charismatic, like when he’s twisting rap tropes into worldly new shapes on “No Fly List” (“Sweatsuit on with an Hermès turban/Pull up on a bad, brown ting out in Durban”)."

Their fourth album, Vortex, casts them just as often as a malevolent rock band as black metal recreationists.","By their very name, side projects entail second-class status. They’re not a musician’s main act, or, at the very least, they’re the other outlet that’s taking attention away from the reason we care about said musician in the first place. They’re a “project,” too, an experiment taken up with no certainty that the results will work or pay off or be worthy of elevating it to a “profession.” Side projects, though, often possess a clear raison d’etre-- a musician isn’t getting everything they need from the mothership, so they start a new group to provide that opportunity. There’s an idea behind the new band, then, a goal that’s approachable and often aided by their previous cumulative experience.The Howling Wind is the black metal side project of multi-instrumentalist Ryan Lipynsky and drummer Tim Call, respective East Coast and West Coast metal musicians with exhaustive résumés. During the last two decades, Lipynsky has cycled through a series of related acts, from the black metal benders Thralldom and the futuristic sludge crew Unearthly Trance to the newly slow and brutal Serpentine Path. Thralldom’s best moments came when they treated black metal as a textural starting point and not a technical endgame, meaning Lipynsky has long worked for nearly 20 years in music that’s specialized in deliberate, tectonic quakes. Relatedly, Call seems to spend most of his time locked in distended doom epics; he toured as the drummer in Mournful Congregation earlier this year, plays with down-tuned Pacific Northwest outfit Shadow of the Torturer and powers the creeping majesty of Portland’s great, funereal Aldebaran. But as the Howling Wind, they’ve made four albums of knotty, atavistic black metal that’s shaken off the tempo torpor of their other outfits. But that’s not to say that they treat the imprint of their other acts as anathema; in fact, Vortex, their latest and fourth, succeeds because it weaves the touchstones of their résumés into these eight tracks very occasionally but very well, too.The Howling Wind have long played fast and loose with the expectations of black metal: Though their 2007 debut Pestilence & Peril mostly charged through distorted, deadpan heaviness, a labyrinth of dark industrial interludes suggested that Call and Lipynski were eager to break outside the bounds-- that’s where they came from, after all. But last year’s excellent Of Babalon moved more toward firm rock'n'roll ground, with the hard-driving “Scaling the Walls” and the concise, swift beating of “Beast of the Sea” highlighting the differences between this and their other activities. To an extent, that still holds for Vortex, which casts the Howling Wind just as often as a malevolent rock band as black metal recreationists. “At the End of the Earth” suggests stoner rock with a sugar rush, with Lipynski’s tar-thick riffs pushed along by Call’s italicized beats. While “Alignment of Celestial Bodies” takes shape around several old-school black metal sequences; it tends to rumble along like Motörhead, too, with a mid-tempo chug functioning as the glue between its flickering leads and blast beats. Most notable, though, might be the searching, psychedelic solo at song’s end. The knot of notes is too colorful to be grim. It’s an a-ha moment for the band, proof positive of their broad interests."

The moody guitar confessionals she creates as Snail Mail contend with suburban teenage ennui—the angst of feeling like you’re the only person who’s truly alive in a dulled world. But unlike so many other disillusioned 18-year-olds with a Fender and a microphone, Jordan does not whine or wallow; she transcends. She articulates the self-conscious shame of youth with a startling clarity, but she also knows that these things too will pass. Her sorrowful pleas—of disappointment, of confusion, of unrequited queer love—often turn into triumphs upon hitting open air. When she claims “I’ll never love anyone else” on her debut album, Lush, she is not moping—she sounds psyched, turning the sad sentiment into a singalong, as a rush of bass, drums, and jangling chords raise her up high.With Lush, Jordan earns her place as a leader in the next generation of indie rock, the ones who are keeping the genre’s honorable ideals alight while continuing to expand its purview beyond straight white dudes. She was born in June 1999, the same month Napster started, and by the time she was in her early teens, the once-sturdy walls that separated mainstream and underground music were all but rubble. So while Jordan is indebted to the ethos of ’90s indie rock, she bends it to her will and her moment. There are echoes of early Liz Phair in Lush’s stark guitars and its tightrope walk between despair and enlightenment, but there are also flashes of the Replacements’ Paul Westerberg at his most wrung-out, and Paramore’s Hayley Williams crinkled emo soulfulness, and Fiona Apple’s ferocity, and Taylor Swift’s savvy heartache, and the solemn quietude of Frank Ocean’s Blonde. Jordan doesn’t make a big show of her eclecticism on the album—on its face, it is a collection of slow and mid-tempo guitar rock songs—but there are details that separate it from the tried-and-true indie of yesteryear, that make it feel born into her era.For one, Lush lives up to its name; “I never wanted to make a lo-fi record,” Jordan recently said. All 10 songs go down clean, every note is heard, every part delivered with both verve and poise. As a classically trained guitarist who began playing at age 5, Jordan colors many tracks with layers of pleasingly sour chords kissed by reverb, her clean tone in concert with her emotional transparency. Her guitar work helps Lush achieve a sidewinding spell that invites obsessive listening. It also opens up plenty of space for her bandmates to add unfussy accompaniment and, most importantly, for her voice to ring out unencumbered. Whereas her vocals were buried on 2016’s Habit EP, they are gloriously exposed on Lush, and we really hear Lindsey Jordan for the first time."

It was raining hard, I was trudging along under my umbrella, and it felt great. It's the driest year this area has had in many years, and I realized while walking that I hadn't used an umbrella even once in six months or more. On my discman was the new record by Connecticut's Landing, a loose concept album about cycles and weather called Seasons. The song playing was ""Encircled (Through Falling Leaves).""In the second stanza of ""Encircled,"" the words ""rain... comes... falling... down..."" are sung in a whisper next to the wet, resonant picking of an acoustic guitar. The only thing that could have possibly sounded better at that moment would have been The Clientele, but they wouldn't have had the element of surprise because every damn song of theirs is about the rain. Landing caught me off guard and made me smile to myself on a dark, wet morning.It's dry again now. I'm listening to Landing in the air-conditioned comfort of my living room, and something is missing. Of course, Seasons isn't having the chill-inducing effect it did when the weather seemed orchestrated for the theme, but in truth, I just don't like this album as much as either Oceanless or the Centrefuge EP. To the band's credit, they're stretching out on Seasons and trying things only hinted at before. Where Oceanless was comprised of lengthy, mindbending excursions into shoegaze psychedelia, on Seasons, Landing become a song-oriented band, crafting comparatively short, spare tunes that showcase the vocals of husband-and-wife co-leaders Aaron and Adrienne Snow.Befitting the music, Mr. and Mrs. Snow sing in hushed whispers, where melodies are given gentle prodding and encouragement rather than being shoved into the cold world on their own. The aforementioned ""Encircled"" is unusual for the record in how folky it sounds, with a plucked acoustic and vocals high in the mix. It actually has something of a 70s singer/songwriter vibe to it, suggesting something quiet by Cat Stevens. I prefer this acoustic tunefulness to the indie slowcore of ""Clarke Street,"" where Landing clearly strive for Low territory, but unfortunately lack the singing ability required of something so clear and direct.I much prefer the longer, more experimental tracks on Seasons to the more conventional songs. ""First Snow"" is by far my favorite, a slowly building wall of sound with tufts of guitar distortion gathering like white flakes in a pile of dead leaves. It's a song without verse or chorus featuring the pretty sound of Adrienne and Aaron harmonizing together, and it reminds me of something from Piano Magic's Low Birth Weight shorn of dark and gloomy edges. Also interesting is ""Ruins of the Morning (So Cold),"" which starts in a drifting, amorphous cloud of distortion, turns into a chiming, raga-like drone, and then transforms into a minimal slowcore track that seems like a completely different song, all in the span of eight minutes.""Blue Sky Away"" closes the album on an up note, with an open, sunny vibe that feels looser and more relaxed than anything preceding it.

For Ellis, his stutter is simply a facet of his person—it only becomes an issue when faced with others’ expectations. But rather than try to suppress it, Ellis makes ample space for dysfluency in his life. He stylizes his first name as “JJJJJerome” because it’s the word he blocks on most often, and on The Clearing he brings speech directly into his art so that the stutter might make itself at home.“I speak with a stutter, I am Black, and I am a musician,” Ellis begins on “Jede Krankheit ist ein musikalisches Problem,” laying out three intersecting elements of his identity. The Clearing began as an essay Ellis wrote for the Journal of Interdisciplinary Voice Studies titled The clearing: Music, dysfluency, Blackness and time. While writing about the use of Black music as a means of resistance against hegemonically white notions of time and fluency, he became curious about pairing the piece with an audible component. Against a backdrop of hip-hop, house, ambient, and jazz-inspired sounds—all musical forms with a strong Black identity—Ellis experimented with reading his words and sharing his experiences, taking full advantage of the aural medium. Any instance of a stutter became part of the work. “My thesis is that Blackness, dysfluency, and music are forces that open time,” he says in the opening “Loops of Retreat,” and the way the strings swell beneath his long pause between “Blackness” and “dysfluency” do just that, cracking open conventional notions of linearity. The Clearing is both a theoretical investigation and a piece of resistance art in itself, pushing back against societal expectations of performative fluency.Ellis recorded himself speaking in a variety of situations to show how his glottal block can vary. He’s more likely to stutter while reading in silence and less likely when reading over music, due to a phenomenon known as masked auditory feedback, so passages of the essay are recited both ways. On a pair of tracks called “The Bookseller,” he records two calls he makes to Barnes & Noble. The first time, the words get stuck in his throat before getting out the title of the book he’s looking for, and the employee assumes the call has been dropped. They hang up. The second time, he prefaces the conversation by warning the clerk about his stutter, and he’s given the time to speak at his own pace. Later, on “Milta,” Ellis has a candid phone conversation with his mentor—someone that already knows about his stutter—and reads back to her a letter that she wrote to him. He still stammers, but sounds relaxed and unrushed, comfortable knowing he’s free of any expectation to speak quickly or smoothly."

She started small, with post-minimal solo piano pieces, but her new album features more than a dozen musicians revolving through laborious arrangements.","After Rodan, a Louisville post-hardcore band that wracked the raw Slint template with mathy tangles, the late guitarist Jason Noble made a natural transition to the more atmospheric Rachel's. They were ahead of the curve on integrating chamber music with post-rock, and even further ahead on drawing inspiration from 20th-century minimalism rather than older classical music. With the addition of key members Christian Frederickson on viola and Rachel Grimes on piano, they were just in front of Godspeed and just behind Dirty Three, whom they resembled in their lonesome, ramshackle temperament. They put out some indelible records in the back half of the '90s and continued into the mid-'00s.Since then, Rachel Grimes has struck out on a post-classical career that jettisons the rock vestiges of the band that coincidentally took her name. She started small, with respectable post-minimal solo piano pieces, on Book of Leaves. Now, she is after a larger quarry: the contemporary chamber ensemble. But she does not quite capture it on The Clearing. With more than a dozen musicians (including electronic processing by Scott Morgan of Loscil) revolving through laborious arrangements, the record feels under-composed and overdesigned. The grace that marks the best of Rachel's and Grimes' solo piano is oppressed by ambitious but vague gestures that evoke John Cage's enigmatic piano phrasing and La Monte Young's keen long tones to unclear ends.At first, the record rigidly alternates between short interludes and long tracks, though the pattern relaxes as it goes along. The former range from the Eno-like slow-motion tumble of ""The Air"" to ""Transverse Plane Vertical"", where a string section, a bassist, a harpist, a drummer, and several winds all crowd into a kind of country-less folk dance. Oddly, these shorter pieces are some of the most thorough. On the longer ones, perfunctory harshness tries to distract from inchoate forms. Neither the glockenspiel-like embellishments nor the dissonant bleats of cello and viola have much to do with the irritating stuck piano note on the title track. Lower piano notes add to the textural and harmonic murk, though the strings contain the germ of an idea—Middle Eastern ululations as sternly imagined by Mahler, perhaps. But no melody lodges in the ear, and the piece plods. It's a very long eight minutes that never really seems to arrive.It's not the only time an idea refuses to take shape. On ""The Herald"", Jacob Duncan's saxophone brings in a nocturnal soft-jazz flavor, which is not bad except for the desultory blurts of piano. The piano part improves when the jazz subsides, but the alternation of these two modes is unsatisfying; they refuse to become compatible. Eventually, the piano begins to play melodiously with the winds and the track slips into a pocket, if not exactly a resolved structure. Grimes usually fares best with sonority. Though ""Further Foundation"" has awkward spots, particularly in its clunky pizzicato, it's relatively pretty and unencumbered, with a piano line like sheets of rain washing down a window. The music comes unclogged, tapping into some of the old post-rock sweep and space. The latter can be especially hard to find. ""In the Vapor With the Air Underneath"" is like an un-limpid Harold Budd. The piano patters tightly against its own granulated shine, and the lack of breathing room, with clumpy timbres and clotted harmonies, is characteristic of the record.We relate to instrumental music in ways beyond how it sounds—we also relate to the composer's decisions and intentions. It's on this second level that The Clearing can be confusing. ""The Air at Night"" is a long ambient outro with little to distinguish it at the compositional level. It becomes especially stark when the usual slow piano chords, played with unvarying timing, return, their tone made limp and wilted for some reason. It's a wan centerpiece for such a long table, and I have no instinct as to how to interpret the gesture, which is to say, how to feel. Grimes drops us into some deep thickets, but gives us no compass by which to find our way, and her record's titular concept proves elusive."

But it makes sense that Bowerbirds, a North Carolina duo known for its soft and folksy paeans to nature, would reckon frankly with The End on The Clearing: Nowhere else is death quite as palpable-- sensible, even-- as the garden, the forest, the backyard. ""Oh, my dear friend, everything falls to death,"" Phil Moore sings on the opening track. ""We tuck the darkness in.""Bowerbirds' first two LPs-- 2007's Hymns for a Dark Horse and 2009's Upper Air-- were relatively spare productions, but The Clearing is broad and ambitious, featuring more (and richer) instrumentation and unprecedented studio gleam. In the three years since Upper Air, Moore and girlfriend/bandmate Beth Tacular have grappled with a spate of challenges-- Tacular fell ill (then recovered), they broke up, they got back together, they rescued and adopted a dog (the same one they accidentally walloped with their tour van), they hand-built a little cabin in the woods (""The logs we peeled and stacked in a ring/ And then we crowned it, our tiny house, with tin""). Plenty of things broke; a few got fixed. All those ends and beginnings ultimately became creative fodder, and The Clearing is imbued with a kind of stubborn tenuousness: Here we are, still holding on, waiting for the thaw. ""There's a hope that we have what we need,"" Moore and Tacular harmonize on ""Stitch the Hem"", and it seems, just then, like the only hope worth having.Bowerbirds have mined this space before, and most of the lyrical memes here-- nature, alienation, love-- are familiar. Nearly every track references the earth in one way or another: the soil, the stars, the sea, the long winter. But erstwhile fans might be a little spooked by the record's production. The Clearing was mostly recorded at April Base, Bon Iver's Wisconsin studio-house-retreat, with Brian Joseph (who engineered Bon Iver), and includes bountiful layers and plenty of moving parts (violin, cello, trombone, clarinet, organ, vibraphone, to start).  The Clearing is deliberately polished for a folk record, but what it lacks in scrappiness it makes up for in its precise, artful construction. Just like Moore and Tacular's home in the forest, The Clearing feels lovingly erected, fashioned bit by bit. Making something-- slotting different parts together, building a whole from disparate elements-- is a reasonable way to grapple with all the ancient, exhausting burdens of new adulthood: to make sense of a tough year.Moore stretches his vocals in places, pushing into an upper register that conveys a welcome sense of desperation (and a necessary contrast to the album's otherwise shiny surfaces). It's not surprising that a record preoccupied with life cycles would contain at least one origin story, and ""Brave World"" lifts a few key lines-- ""My name, it means nothing/ My age it means less/ The country I come from is called the Midwest""-- from Dylan's anti-war anthem ""With God on Our Side"", but it's less about fighting than the places we come from. Over nervous, tapping percussion, Moore lays it out, his voice rising: ""I'm dust and you're dust and we're honest.""For all its dark moments, The Clearing is ultimately hopeful. ""Now We Hurry On"", the closing track, echoes a lyric from ""In Our Talons"", the standout moment from Bowerbirds' debut. ""No, you're not alone,"" Moore promises. There's the sun and the sparrows and the red dirt path, there's ""me and my true love."" Plenty, in other words, to find solace in."

The Clearing could be their most nuanced record to date.","Plenty of bands play music that sounds dark, but few can make every note bleed black and breathe smoke. Count Locrian as part of that select circle. Something about the Chicago trio's sound is inherently ominous-- it's hard to imagine them playing ""Chopsticks"" without turning it into an earth-threatening thunderstorm. That effect is obvious in their noisier, more chaotic moments, where metallic noise and intense howls coalesce into scary crescendos. But it's just as strong in their quieter, more ambient stretches, when they build tension not from heightened climax but from sustained nuance.The Clearing could be Locrian's most nuanced record so far. Throughout, they use slow, far-off sounds rather in-your-face noise to thicken the atmosphere. A frozen piano line, distant drum roll, or shadowy bass loop is often all the group needs to forge a palpable mood. More than half of the side-long, album-closing title track is made of such minimal material. Yet somehow the band mines it for 17 minutes of sonic pressure. When the song eventually swells into a gnarled thatch of static and low end, Locrian sound less like a group gaining momentum than a mountain rising up through the ocean after years of rumbling below the surface.There are more covert moments of tension on The Clearing, and they're pretty powerful, too. Most pulverizing is ""Augury in an Evaporating Tower"", whose mix of tones showcases the band's agility. At points, the cascading drums and elongated screams conjure Prurient screamer Dominick Fernow's black metal band Ash Pool. But the band deftly shifts to oscillating drone and sky-seeking guitar that sound like Earth's Dylan Carlson battling a synth monster. ""Chalk Point"", on the other hand, takes a more traditional path to its climax, building piano chords into a kind of post-rock metal dirge.Still, what impresses most about The Clearing is not specific turns or isolated moments, but the overwhelming mood it creates. That's what makes the album title apt-- Locrian's dark atmospheres aren't empty spaces, but stark traces of something that was there not long before. In other words, they're as good at creating negative spaces as they are at filling them in. Even when they get so subdued that they approach silence, you can hear ghosts echoing in their void."

She strikes a balance between sounding naive enough to pray to the altar of American rap flash and excess and savvy enough to recognize her own distance from it.","Naturally awkward people can produce a powerful charm in the right context. Norway's Erlend Øye, one half of indie-folk duo Kings of Convenience, has built much of his career aesthetic on this paradox. Recall the video for the 2004 single ""I'd Rather Dance With You"", which finds Øye in a red and white tracksuit, navigating a throng of giggling girls in a ballet class and letting his limbs fly and droop in a series of choreographed moves. He's a master of leaning calmly into his gawkiness rather than attempting to mask it, and he exudes an unassuming sort of confidence as a result. So it was no surprise to see him pop up alongside a young Bulgarian woman named DENA last summer in a video for a knowingly goofy but genuinely infectious rap single called ""Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools"". There they were, two peas in a pod: gangly, welcoming, unpretentious, deeply European. ""If you're listening to this in a hot country/ Please come rescue me,"" DENA raps in her thick Bulgarian accent in an assortment of clashing outfits, ""If you got a swimming pool, then we can be hanging.”Part M.I.A.-informed party rap, part YouTube novelty, part small-town Eastern European documentary, “Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools” had all the hallmarks of a meme-y, flash-in-the-pan internet rap hit. (DENA’s YouTube account name is ""denafromtheblock"".) But the kitsch of her style translates nicely across her debut album Flash, a small and inviting record that is unfazed—delighted, even—by its own rough edges and occasionally bumbling sensibilities. It’s an album that lifts from an almost comically basic hip-hop and social-media glossary to talk about young adult love and frustration and ambition in an endearing way: “Haters gonna hate/ Lovers gonna love/ If you mess with me/ You get a total ignore,” DENA raps bluntly on “Total Ignore”. “You can’t believe that my beats so banging/ Yeah, I made it all while you were hanging,” she boasts. The production, which DENA handled herself, is a studied blend of clatter, simple keyboard melodies, and quiet boom-bap.Which isn’t to say that Flash is cartoon music. DENA strikes a delicate balance between sounding naive enough to pray to the altar of American rap flash and excess and savvy enough to recognize her own distance from it. “I haven’t been taking any planes today/ You’re the one who whisks away and I’m the one who stays,” she laments on “Jet Lag”. “I think I’m having jet lag without even having fun.” The record is more nuanced and knowing than simple white-girl gag rap; DENA’s charm buffers her from some of the pitfalls of her outsider-rap status. Flash carves her out a new space in a crowded sphere: She's a refreshing foil to the jaded slickness of an artist like Lorde, the brutal tone-deafness of someone like the white Swedish rapper Yung Lean, or the overbearing cutesiness of a Kitty Pryde.There’s a sense that DENA earned her sly stripes because she's a true music nerd, and that she uses music as a means of escaping small-town claustrophobia. It’s evident on a song like “Cash, Diamond Rings, Swimming Pools”, where she sings that she’s “hanging here and wishing to be there, ending up with not really being anywhere.” Some of her best work came in the form of a SoundCloud mix called “High on Hi Hats”, which blended together an unexpected list of contemporary remix obscurities with forgotten classics like Guru and Kelis’ “Supa Love”. Like the best kind of nerd, she’s done her research. Now she just wants to participate and share, and doesn't mind showing off her imperfections in the process."

Their goal is to build a platform for Asian rappers and singers who’ve adopted the sound of contemporary American hip-hop and reinterpreted it through the lens of their own lives, often to massive viral success. While not all of its roster is from abroad—singer AUGUST 08 is from Los Angeles—most of it is made of young artists from China, Indonesia, and Japan who initially took it upon themselves to create videos and songs that blended mischievous humor and chest-thumping braggadocio in the hopes of maybe one day falling into pop stardom. Head in the Clouds is the final push to that dream, pairing 88’s roster with some of the most distinctive voices in hip-hop right now for a collection of trap anthems, poolside bops, and starry-eyed ballads aimed to infiltrate the Top 100. Unfortunately, only a handful of the album’s 17 tracks stand on their own as singular works; the rest are stiff, boilerplate copies of songs by other artists currently racking up streams.The ones that do succeed sound like they were written purely for top-down twilight rides in the summertime. “Peach Jam,” a collab between oddball YouTube personality turned singer Joji and Memphis’ BlocBoy JB is a pulpy ode to sex built around a recurring “Hey-ya!” chant. It acts as one long bridge, the kind of morsel that inspires VIP sections to jump on couches and collectively sing out of tune. And “History,” a solo cut by the droll MC Rich Brian, is further proof of the Jarkata rapper’s knack for melding his low huff of a voice with playful production to build understated hits, as he wistfully looks back on a past fling over bright flute synths and tinkering hi-hats. The lyricism displayed here is nothing special—BlocBoy may take the crown for the most senselessly evocative line when he raps, “You my baby like fetus,” on “Peach”—but the songs are breezy and fun without overextending their reach.The same can’t be said for the syrupy R&B tracks, primarily handled by AUGUST 08 and 19-year-old singer NIKI. Woozy opener “La Cienega,” named for the major thoroughfare in L.A., is a cliché take on the tedium of fame, erected on blasé lyrics about the “glitz” of “la la land” and a hulking synth line that aims for sensuousness but instead comes off hammy. Later on, “I Want In,” a dedication to willingly losing sight of a lover’s imperfections in a haze of lust, sees AUGUST 08 and NIKI trying to embrace the sounds of caribana and soca to listless results, a duller version of one of PARTYNEXTDOOR’s dancehall-tinged melodies."

In fact, Dilla, if anything, is imposing a meta-rap bent on neo-soul, assaulting the senses in ways unseemly for a guy who used to work with Q-Tip. The drums, though remarkably fluid, are lighter, domineered by dense, abrasive samples that are sequenced with a sense of swing. Percussive end pieces are shorn cheese-grater sharp, then appended to sickly spliced moans. The end result is akin to Norman Smith and DJ Shadow sitting in on a RZA-produced session-- spry, voiceless prog-hop by any other name.Opener ""Workinonit"" comes on like a Rubin-produced take on Schoolhouse Rock. Clang-y guitars give way to doubled-up groans and what sounds like a back-masked Zulu chant. The sample, supplied by '60s soulsters Them, is diced with manic precision, and around the 2:00 mark, the melody builds to a climax, fading, with echo-y vocal bits, into bodiless abyss. Equally engaging is ""Anti-American Graffiti"", which combines lighters-up, love-not-war humility with a track both wistful and world-weary: A crazed voice spouts end-of-the-world admonishments like some disenfranchised apparition, colliding with somber guitars.""Don't Cry"" finds Dilla taking sprightly, blu-lite soul crooning and flipping it counter-cockeyed: ""If Blue Magic or Whoever could see me now!"" First he plays the original, then throws in the ""Now, you play it and I'll show you how my voice would have made it unbelievable!"" bit, before gently lifting its face off. It's chest thumping, to be sure, like the Copa shot in Goodfellas or Bigger and Deffer. And it's courteous. Similarly cordial is ""Time: The Donut of the Heart"", where he turns the Jackson 5's ""All I Do Is Think of You"" into a lucid dream-- the song's intro is now with the chorus it always coveted. Says ?uestlove: ""[J Dilla] time compresses Michael and Jermaine's ad-libs with the uneasy ease of a tightrope-walker, with oil shoes on, crossing one 90-story building to another, after eight shots of [Patrone]."" I'm sayin'.Not that Donuts deals with only obvious sample sources-- ""The Twister (Huh, What)"" is the sound of flu-sick flutes chiming in time to a busted weathervane; ""Waves"", a hiccuping Hare Krishna class. It's Dilla's show-and-tell method, however, that's most effective, because it illustrates how he's, more or less, upgrading soul music-- we get to see how he unpacked its bag, what spots he told it it missed. This approach also allows Dilla to pay homage to the selfsame sounds he's modernized; the drums are light, to reflect the original sound from which he's borrowing. In that sense, Donuts is pure postmodern art-- which was hip-hop's aim in the first place."

Two years later, her Born Yesterday EP adopted a stripped-back live sound, allowing her songs to come together regardless of arrangement. After a brief hiatus, she reconvened with producer Tyler Chester and traded guitars for Ableton, becoming the latest folk musician to embrace electronics. But reinventions do not guarantee a satisfying record. Without the self-assurance of her debut, Glaspy’s follow-up, Devotion, is an album in search of an identity. Part lighthearted synth-pop, part mild-mannered MOR pop, it’s too slight to endanger a promising career but too bland to be an interesting misfire.With Devotion, Glaspy trades swagger for sincerity, risking corniness for the sake of honest expression. It should feel liberating—and writing it likely did—but on record it’s either unimaginative or baffling. With the exception of “You Amaze Me,” buried towards the end of the record, Glaspy strays away from the favorable Elliott Smith comparisons of her debut. As Devotion attempts to push in new directions, misguided stylistic choices turn into distractions. When Glaspy opens “Killing What Keeps Us Alive” with a garbled vocoder, it only recalls the sound Imogen Heap perfected 15 years ago.Nothing else is equally jarring, but the stylistic missteps continue throughout. “What’s the Point” leads with a dubstep synth before delving into an aimless imitation of John Congleton’s crunchy, flanged productions. Ballads like “Young Love” and “Without Him” are closer to Sara Bareilles territory, without the benefit of Bareilles’ extroversion and big choruses. Title track “Devotion” veers so far into adult-contemporary R&B that it begins to resemble Maroon 5’s “Sunday Morning.” When Glaspy and Chester do land on a memorable, sinuous groove with “You’ve Got My Number,” the song stumbles over ungainly lyrics like, “And if I had to choose just a few words to summarize you/‘Gorgeous’ and ‘true’ wouldn’t surprise you.”The simplistic couplets and labored aphorisms are the record’s biggest disappointment. Glaspy’s penchant for stringing together idioms turns whole verses into mush: “They say two halves make a whole/But I am half empty and you are half full,” she proclaims on “Without Him.” On the lone rocker “So Wrong It’s Right,” a series of dog puns abruptly turns maudlin: “Tonight I’m off the leash, running wild and free/And you just so happen to be right next to me.” Glaspy’s wordplay sometimes leaned on “fish in the sea”-style clichés in the past, but here the folksy turns of phrase become overwhelming. The preciousness muddles her ideas, like the non-dichotomy posed by “Stay With Me”: “When it all shakes down/Who’s the clown and who’s the savior?”Devotion is not a disaster, but the chasm between ambition and execution feels vast. The new ideas are ill-fitting, when they’re not derivative from the start. Beneath the processing, the album’s best moments sound oddly like a less polished version of Emotions & Math. Even “You Amaze Me,” a lovely intimate acoustic number, feels like a lesser “Somebody to Anybody,” a lovely intimate acoustic number from the last album. Otherwise, little on this record works with Glaspy’s strengths as a songwriter—or, due to the change in instrumentation, as a musician. There are still glimpses of her usual frank, heartfelt songwriting on Devotion, but they’re not worth seeking out in a package this dull.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

To some, the blemishes and dimples on a handmade ceramic bowl will always be better than the machine-made replica. The Japanese call this kind of beauty wabi-sabi; some European thinkers refer to such ineffable idiosyncrasy as “aura.” But at this point, imperfection has been perfected and mass-produced in the form of distressed jeans, faux-vintage furniture, and certain lo-fi music. Encountering something genuinely, gorgeously flawed is elusive. Tirzah Mastin’s debut album Devotion is a compelling vision of what imperfect pop music can be—joyful in both sound and feeling precisely because both seem so out-of-step and asymmetrical.Tirzah began to hone this vision in 2013 when she released I’m Not Dancing, an EP of eccentric dance-music ballads she made with the British producer and composer Mica Levi. The EP’s title track, one of Tirzah’s defining songs, sounds as unconventional and alluring now as it did half a decade ago: Wheezing, blown-out synthesizers and rickety drum hits mingle with her quietly loud voice—so pure, so raspy, so dogged and cool all at once. It begs you to lean in closer and make sure the speakers aren’t broken. Like Jai Paul or FKA twigs, her delivery is unguarded and messy in the way someone singing alone in the shower might belt out a song. Listening to her feels somehow both private and totally casual, a peculiar sort of shared intimacy. It’s this quality that makes Devotion so particular.Working again with Levi, who has produced all of Tirzah’s past music, she’s moved away from the bright, ramshackle club music vibe of past releases, and together, they’ve honed a sound that’s lean and almost uncomfortably close. The spare style allows the listener to really zoom in on each little detail of Tirzah’s voice—and in that space, things get pretty intense.On the opener “Fine Again,” Tirzah takes time to savor each word she sings—elongating every little detail of the word “fine” and unlocking new timbres as she goes. But the song doesn’t move along smoothly. It starts, stops, and hiccups, tripping you up once you’re comfortable. You look to Tirzah’s vocal as an anchor, but then the vocal line gets thrown across the room, multiplied into choruses, muted, pitch-shifted, sped up, slowed down, and torn apart. Serenity arrives when one heartstopping romantic phrase—“This feels so pure this feels rare”—rings clear. This all happens in under three minutes, and it’s representative of what Devotion does well: It’s an invitation to explore the nooks and crannies of adult relationships."

She sings as if in a daze about stolen glances and trepid desire, her words lifted skyward by synthetic strings and weightless, arpeggiating piano. The transportive song, “Press Play,” signals that listeners should rid themselves of any assumptions regarding the record’s grounding in Jean’s current reality.The 36-year-old Australian folk-turned-pop singer long ago reached an age at which the episodes recounted in “Press Play,” involving “popular girls” and watching crushes stare out of school bus windows, faded from her day-to-day life. But Jean wrote Devotion as a tribute to her teenage years, a time when she was, by her own description, “eccentric” and “romantically-unfulfilled.” Throughout the album, she revisits her nascent sexuality and formative obsessions without glossing over her younger self’s complex emotional life, the way adult artists often do when depicting teens. Devotion is nostalgic by its very nature—yet, at its best, the album captures the experiences of first love and lust with remarkable immediacy, rather than the fuzzed-out romanticism of hindsight.Jean’s retrospective gaze is especially sharp on “Girls on the TV,” which narrates a childhood friendship with a girl she calls “Ricky.” In adolescence, Ricky weathered her share of storms—bullying, drugs, sexual harassment—and Jean recounts them with both anguish and fierce optimism. Other songs on the album lack such robust narratives, but the vibrance of Jean’s storytelling is consistent; she has a way of surfacing small, unexpected details that often say more about a moment than endless exposition can. It’s a skill she shares with some of the best chroniclers of teen romance. When she sings, “I smell the humidity of the concrete,” while describing a budding dalliance on “Northerly,” she taps into the same sensory bliss that makes the opening lines of Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” so captivating. Lorde has praised Devotion’s lead single, “Touchstone,” for its eloquent “communication of the spooky, all-consuming nature of feminine love”—a subject the track shares with some of Lorde’s own songs, like “Writer in the Dark.”Swift and Lorde documented their respective comings-of-age from different corners of the youth-obsessed pop space, and it’s fitting that Jean’s embrace of this same subject matter finds her straying from her folk roots, in favor of more pop-oriented sounds. When it comes to instrumentation, the transition feels natural: Jean’s voice is light enough to blend in with the pillowy synths she introduces and nimble enough to keep pace with upshifted percussion.There are moments, however, when pop magic proves elusive. The success of songs like the ones on Devotion (and Fearless, and Melodrama) is often determined by the strength of their hooks. Pushed to write slicker, stickier tracks than ever before, Jean sometimes comes up short. At times, her attempts at lyrical simplicity yield extreme reductiveness: On “Which One Are You?,” she splits humanity into a series of binaries, then dreamily wonders which group her paramour falls into. Reaching for universal resonance, she grasps clichéd language instead.In chronicling teen romance, Jean has taken on one of pop culture’s most commodified, trope-laden subjects. But it’s only when she leans into specificity and idiosyncrasy, rather than single-mindedly courting wide appeal, that she captures the spectacular novelty that makes young love worth revisiting in the first place."

The music of Beach House, the Baltimore-based duo of multi-instrumentalist Alex Scally and vocalist/organist Victoria Legrand, is a shadow narrative running parallel to this trend: Their delicate, lovelorn pop comes in the form of deathly waltzes and dark pastoral dirges on which Legrand sings about desire, loss, and dreams as if telling a ghost story, splitting the difference between lovely and creepy.For pristine pop, Beach House's self-titled 2006 debut was awfully raw: Legrand downplayed her classical piano and voice training in a humble negation of virtuosity. The organs sounded like something thick and coarse being pulled through a small, jagged opening; chord structures were simply suggestions; imperfections were kept intact. That balance of beauty and imprecision made inspired songs like ""Saltwater"", ""Tokyo Witch"", ""Apple Orchard"", and ""Master of None"" easy to fall in love with.The duo's songwriting hasn't fundamentally changed on Devotion; they've simply cleaned up their act. These are crisper, brighter, bolder songs, retaining Beach House's sense of elegant decay while sweeping up the debris. ""Gila"" is a funeral on a sunny day; its shimmering organs are controlled, never bleeding chaotically as they did on the debut, and are complemented by frilly but steadfast guitar. ""Turtle Island"" reaffirms Beach House's preference for simple, skeletal percussion, but its dense melody is a marked advancement. The result of this pre-spring cleaning is that Devotion lacks some of the immediate highs of the first album-- you no longer get the sense of rooting for an embattled underdog-- but winds up consistently stronger.Even though it's tidier and more streamlined, the music surrenders none of its autumnal charm, and there's still a sense of eavesdropping on a private, ongoing dialogue between Legrand and a ghost. Of course, we only get to hear her side of the story. As on the first album, which began with the words ""Love you all the time, even though you're not mine,"" she favors second-person assertions that speak of self-effacement, dependence, and sinister dream-world conversations. ""Your wish is my command,"" she intones on ""Wedding Bell"", becoming a genie in a puff of smoke. And on ""Gila"", she sings in a world-weary wheeze, ""Man, you've got a lot of jokes to tell."" But instead of the punch line, we get the sort of jarring shift that characterizes dreams: ""So you throw your baby's banners down the well.""""Invite your sister into the garden,"" she drones on the wind-up waltz ""You Came to Me"", concurrently inviting us into the murky depths of her romantic consciousness. There's a sense of latent danger in the invitation, like a siren song luring us toward sharp clusters of rock. Portals into mysterious spaces pockmark Devotion; none of them promise a way out. Perhaps this explains why an album that takes its title and concept from a superficially sweet concept has such a subtle bite: Legrand's devotion is a dungeon into which she tosses her own desires like coins into a wishing well, a one-way conduit from which only echoes return."

He recorded the self-titled debut-- a collection of lo-fi garage, glam, punk, darkwave, and rock'n'roll-- largely by himself out of boredom during the Marked Men's hiatus. When people showed interest, he found it strange. Then, when he started getting requests to play some Mind Spiders festival sets, he did what Cloud Nothings and Wavves did before him: put together a band that would later accompany him in the studio. But while Dylan Baldi had three guys on Attack on Memory and Nathan Williams brought two along for King of the Beach, Ryan wrangled a veritable murderer's row of Texas garage staples for Meltdown: an additional guitarist (Stephen Svacina of Uptown Bums), a bassist (Daniel Fried of Bad Sports and Wax Museums), an organist (Peter Salisbury of Stumptone), and two drummers who play at the same time (Mike Throneberry of the Marked Men and Gregory Rutherford of High Tension Wires). Talk about everything being bigger in Texas.But the mob effect is well-placed on Meltdown, where most of the songs have enormous hooks and use the extra hands for a fuller, more powerful soundscape. The loud-quiet-loud ""Play You Out"", for example, utilizes the extra guitar well-- during the softer moments, one churns the rhythm while the other adds tinges of harmony. When it picks up speed, the extra guitar amplifies the volume, naturally, but also adds another palpable layer of power. As for the second drum set, you have to listen carefully for it-- the occasional fill or cymbal crash will hang over the album's continuous drive-- but the extra kit seems to strengthen each song's percussive backbone. That said, it's not entirely necessary to have all the extra men in the studio-- the supplementary cymbals that follow the soaring opening riff of ""Beat"" could easily be added in post. But it's an album of robust garage-punk fare, and part of the appeal is that it'll sound just as sturdy and huge live.The majority of that energy and volume is stacked right at the front of the album, the A-side brimming with anthemic riffs. It's hard to take opener ""You Are Dead"", a near perfect bit of chugging, under-two-minute power pop, off repeat. Ironically, that opening song also points to one of the biggest potential pitfalls for Ryan: Several tracks on Meltdown hold a not-so-subtle resemblance to Jay Reatard. The hooks, melodies, and even Ryan's voice are eerily similar. See ""More Than You"", which has an organ-led balladry format reminiscent of ""I'm Watching You"". That's not to say Ryan copped Jay's style so much as the two men ran in similar circles and have always had like-minded sensibilities when it comes to songwriting. (See most of Marked Men's recorded output.) And really, it's hard to complain when the songs are as exciting and over-the-top as they are at the front of Meltdown."

But don't let that fire-bathed, tattoo-inspiring cover art fool you: Ash are still a power-pop band. Meltdown does rock harder, and with more snarl, than any of their previous albums, but they still can't help but reveal their melodic sweet tooth. Meltdown is closest to the slick production of their most recent LP, Free All Angels, though the band's Undertones-esque charm has been shelved to make room for sharpened, arena-ready choruses. Following the success of their recent singles compilation, Meltdown sets its crosshairs precisely at the continent across the pond-- it's their most American-sounding album so far.The irony is that this album has been languishing without a stateside release for the past nine months. Hopefully, no one picked up the import sight unseen and expected to get their face melted-- despite palm-muted guitars and rollicking drums, the approach is a little more Smashing Pumpkins than Judas Priest. Most songs intermittently use heavy riffs as dressing to sneak in their sing-a-long melodies, like lead single ""Orpheus"" and ""Detonator"". Only the springy chord-thrashing of ""Clones"" befits the album's artwork, though given the convincing production from Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, System Of A Down) it would fit snugly into an American modern rock playlist. Meltdown has a cohesive sound, but takes a few dips into cliché, like the power ballad ""Starcrossed"" or the Placebo-like lyrical baiting of ""Vampire Love"".Sadly missing here is Ash's sense of vulnerability, a key element to their charm. While it's an obvious grab for North American ears, if this is anyone's first exposure to Ash, they'd be better off hunting down the group's earlier albums to understand why the band has made it this far; Meltdown is an incomplete picture of what they're capable of."

His demented, hypnotic rhymes, full of violence and drugs, initially made him seem a kindred spirit to his cousin 21 Savage. But just as 21 Savage has broadened his appeal, Nudy has also pushed against the borders of his trap sound. He might not boast the flash or obvious eccentricities of his peers, but the rapper born Quantavious Thomas is quietly one of the more unique artists to emerge from his city in years.His first tape, Paradise City, appeared in 2014, but his ascendance began in earnest in 2016 with his Slimeball series. Last year, he made his biggest splash yet with the feature-free surprise mixtape Faded In The Booth and Sli’merre, his collaborative project with producer wunderkind Pi’erre Bourne. The chemistry between Nudy and Pi’erre proved electric, and his new project Anyways expands on that mixtape’s jubilant bounce with some of the darker subject matter of his early work.Young Nudy's taste for experimental production helps distinguish him. The dreamy, cartoonish beat for “Blue Cheese Salad” and the stoned stupor of “A Nudy Story” add unexpected shades to Nudy’s villain mystique, while “Cap Dem” sounds like it was made for Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y rather than a trap artist. These counter-intuitive choices might be off-putting to those who prefer a murkier atmosphere with their street raps, but they keep his music feeling nimble and surprising.It helps that he raps his ass off. Anyways might be Nudy’s best technical performance, both in the variety of his flows and the calmness with which he croaks them out. On “No Go,” he manages to make giving directions to his frequent East Atlanta hangouts sound exciting. His rhymes bristle with energy, confidence, and vivid imagery (“Yellow tape surrounding you and your team/ I’m Majin Buu with the smoke, I blow the steam” he says on “Deeper Than Rap”). The trance-like quality of the production on the album lures you in, but Nudy’s commanding presence keeps you there.Anyways likely won’t drastically alter the arc of Nudy’s career or skyrocket him to success. It’s a quality street-rap record, one that should please his fans and maybe convert a few interested parties. But there’s something undeniable about the devotion with which he chisels away at his craft, like a sculptor obsessing over the curves and crevices of his work. He might never hit superstardom like some of his peers, but he keeps finding something worthwhile to say, and surprising ways to say it."

Like a noise musician pushing power electronics into the red, Monks is an emotionally blown-out singer, and in her tattered voice she cracks, soars, gnarls, growls, drawls, slurs, rasps. Pain radiates through her and into the band’s songs, like the glow of burning charcoal.Heaven is the quartet’s thrilling second album, and while Dilly Dally might still formally recall 1990s alt-rock à la Hole and the Smashing Pumpkins, their songs are noisier, more metallic, deconstructed. Monks’ raw rapture sets the comparisons at some remove. With her unwavering pop sense and keen way with a chorus, you can tell she is a woman who learned guitar through a Beatles songbook. Dilly Dally once covered Drake’s “Know Yourself” to delightfully grotesque effect, and as their fellow 6 dweller has posited: It’s not about who did it first. It’s about who did it right.Dilly Dally wrote Heaven amid a period of intra-band tumult, and even as the album breathes deeply, its best songs betray those struggles. Heaven riffs on themes of power and sex, of confidence and self-care. But self-care is not soft on Heaven; it’s shrill, life or death, a leaden riff. These complex songs exhibit the care as well as the bleak cause that necessitated it. The roiling early highlight “Doom” swings from hushed dream-pop singing to dread-laden, industrial metal; the lyrics spin ominous uncertainty into New Age affirmations. “Remember who you are/And where you’re gonna be/What’s inside you/Is sacred,” Monks sings, contorting the last word into a guttural growl. On “Sober Motel,” Dilly Dally capture the overwhelming, nearly transcendent clarity that sobriety can beget. “When I’m sober/My soul comes screechin’,” Monks hollers, riding along the final careening syllables as if they were the last roller coaster on Earth.“Sober Motel” feels of a piece with “Marijuana,” a song whose vividness tears you apart. As Monks sings sublimely of “angels” who “got ripped and torn apart inside of me,” heaven is clearly a joint: This is a woman’s impassioned love song to weed and its anxiety-quelling properties. “Couldn’t believe/What I see,” Monks sings on the ecstatic chorus, just before it crashes. “Couldn’t believe/Nothing but what’s inside.” As the song breaks down gloriously, “Marijuana” adopts a destabilizing feeling that is patently gorgeous, as if attuned to a deeper sensitivity of sound. Monks has said, “If the band died and went to heaven, this is the album we would make,” and “Marijuana” is indeed its most heavenly moment.Monks penned “Sober Motel” as a “celebration of sobriety,” she wrote in a statement, “in the midst of an industry that is anything but.” Her hope was that its lyrics would become a mantra of mindfulness for the group, whose members have struggled with alcohol on the road, and “create a sort of protective layer around the band” at every show. Much of Heaven feels restorative in that way. But with “Sober Motel” especially, Dilly Dally subtly chip back at the ways music is exploited under capitalism. Its greatest element, as ever, is Monks’ rare voice—jagged, on fire, intoxicating itself."

It was always a bit uncanny that Mobius Band were on Ghostly International, home of the glimmering D.C. maestro Outputmessage and a dozen or so other electronic mavens. But the group's second full-length album, Heaven, which Ghostly has co-released with Misra, affirms what an odd match-up this is. The title track of 2005's debut, The Loving Sounds of Static, was more up to speed with the current configuration of this trio; its chugging guitars, steady bass tap, and slightly airy, elongated vocals that suggested the French Kicks, poor victims of an artish rock scene hovering around New York City back in 2003-ish. But this second release is even bubblier and more straight-laced than its forebear, or anything the French Kicks have ever done.The only reason the opener ""Hallie"" sounds interesting is because its engaging little synth twinkles are predictable; this grates after a handful of listens. And then you have Ben Sterling and Noam Schatz tossing in some powerpuff drums and a plagiarized Modest Mouse lick, making for a song that meanders too much, yet not at all. A slice of a pleasant moment is spliced too quickly to be memorable; listen to the song a few times and it will get memorably boring.It's reasonable to call this album a sequel to Wincing the Night Away; it is as playful, as wintry, as powder-caked, and minutely epic as the Shins' third effort-- and would also fit right in with it rhythmically, melodically, and I suppose philosophically. ""A Hint of Blood"" has a rust-tinged, backlit guitar dancing stupidly around a major scale; when I say stupidly I mean to say it's trying to be inventive but isn't. Similarly, ""Leave the Keys in the Door"" does a thing that's typical on this album, halting and grinding forth the rhythm. The problem is that the tonal contrasts-- ragged and rough; sleek and dripping-- are cool in theory, but the melodies and ideas being fronted aren't strong enough to sustain them. Lyrically, there are too many similes, emaciated metaphors, and boring choruses like, ""I don't need no/ Friends like these, no"" (""Friends Like These). Elsewhere, they create a domestic scenario around a ""paint"" metaphor and decorate the Tom Petty-like chorus with whining, trumpet-like digital synth washes.On ""Under Sand"", slippery croons seesaw in fifths around the same exact drum rhythm as practically every other song on the album, and the only pretty moment is the brief, glorious vocal soar by Peter Sax in the final moments of the chorus. But it dies down far too quickly. Back to the boring fifth seesaw-- ooh, a key change!-- and déjà vu drums. Cool cover art, though."

Rex-- and a sense of calculated disaffection.","Getting the full picture of Joe Williams' debut LP Smoke means making your way past the horrifically gaudy cover image to the production credits inside. There, after Williams' own writer/composer/engineer listing, is the name of the cover model, followed by credits for hair, makeup, ""hookah prop design,"" and of course, ""art."" Williams, it is made clear, rolls as thick as the exhalant that gives his debut its name.That aesthetic emphasis has landed Williams an opening gig for the recent electro-populist double-bill of Girl Talk and Dan Deacon. But while his tourmates get sweaty with the crowd as they tap away at their electronics, Williams keeps a cool distance. His songs are thin and languorous, with impeccable influences and the sort of calculated disaffection that comes from an MFA in design and a good weed connection. His attitude and vocal timbre have earned him comparisons to Beck, and that's more than fair: As glassy, nonchalant dance music, Smoke could be Midnite Vultures Redux: Something for the Blunted.Mostly, though, Williams is a groove-obssesser working through his influences, and doing it with enough restraint and creativity to work them into his songs, leaving the showiness to his cover models. Smoke’s signposts form a coherent musical worldview: ""In the Club"" is T. Rex's ""The Motivator"" at 16 rpm, ""Going Down"" and ""Route to Palm"" work in the 1970s West African guitar colorations that Dirty Projectors, Vampire Weekend, and Islands have been exploring lately, ""New Violence"" hurtles forward with a motorik bassline, and opener ""Headlines"" plays like a bubblegum version of Brian Eno's ""Baby's on Fire"". Even the umpteenth barely-augmented cover of ""I Want Candy"" feels like a distillation of the record's love for veneers.Smoke's fondness of surfaces doesn't stop at the level of rhythmic appropriation, though; Williams takes an observational approach to lyricism that recalls early Roxy Music's tongue-in-cheek take on the glamourous life. In ""Headlines"", he crafts a series of slow motion scenester dioramas like ""Climb all you can/ It's a killer stake/ We'll hang from the branches/ While the mayor dances/ In the headlines."" ""In the Club"" tightens its focus, observing, ""Trashy dancing baby got inside for free/ She's got the basement wrist/ She do the snow-blow twist."" Like his predecessors, Williams doesn't distinguish much between style and peril; the middle of Smoke features ""New Violence"", ""Going Down"", and ""Danger"", which view impending menace as a necessity for sophistication.Williams' ostensible depthlessness, like that of his forebears, is itself only a façade, and Smoke offers plenty to discover across repeated listens-- particularly the way in which he tweaks his own voice, melting and reshaping it like the models' Technicolor ""tears"" on the album cover. This tendency toward sonic self-mutilation underscores the most appealing aspect of Williams' persona: Underneath the mannerisms is a shy kid, too timid to force his will on his audience in the manner of his tour mates, content to watch and comment from the margins. Appropriately, then, a streak of dark nostalgia murmurs just beneath the glitzy exterior of ""The Shadow"". Williams remembers ""driving toward collisions in our heads,"" ""burning buildings and the rivals that we had,"" and ""wailing widows and the moments that we bled,"" and in the process giving some context to that hard-to-forget cover image: fashionable high culture as a sad, grotesque fantasy."

Seyi Vibez),0.0,0.0,1.0,0.307,african,7.8,The L.A. producer's second LP dredges up a jaggedly delicate sound that merges gently wafting electronic tones with intricately decaying rhythmic atmosphere.,"Establishing a sonic personality without lyrical assistance or some unique personal backstory can be tricky, especially when you're in the middle of a room crowded with your peers. The space in question is the one with a ""for fans of Flying Lotus"" sign posted over the door, and there hasn't been a ton of vacancy in there lately. Those who've broken out have done so by tweaking the sonic imprint of decaying beats and melting analog chords until they come across as distinctly tactile things, humid and slippery, blown-out and elastic.Reaching out to clutch the music on Shlohmo's Bad Vibes might cause it to crumble in your grasp-- and then cut the hell out of your fingers. The L.A. producer's sophomore full-length comes after a handful of singles, EPs, remixes, and compilation appearances, as well as last year's disorienting debut, Shlomoshun Deluxe. And in that short yet busy time, Shlohmo has dredged up something strange: an aesthetic that's jaggedly delicate, filled with melodic beauty but jostled by abrasive percussive hitches, undercut with sandpapery patches of ambient fuzz. It's a deft merging of gentle, wafting electronic tones and intricately beat-to-shit rhythmic atmosphere, the sounds of old technology trying to reconcile its former gloss with its fading functionality.The cynical ears that still can't get past the nostalgic surface of chillwave might have their own bone to pick with the cassette-deck/VHS fidelity of Bad Vibes, which stands out pretty prominently in hissy tracks like ""Same Time"" and ""Parties"". But instead of celebrating corroded, neon-pastel magnetic-tape detritus for its own sake, the music on this album leans closer to an appreciation of the actual rhythmic counterpoints, quirks, and resonant qualities of white noise. Alongside the moments that seem to revel in the flutter and crackle of old equipment are stretches that draw similar vibes from the sound of literal rainfall (""Seriously"") or birdcall-strewn field recordings (""Big Feelings"")-- not to mention the texture you can get from good old-fashioned feedback, like the keyboard squall of ""Trapped in a Burning House"".The beats themselves are striking enough, whether they're the distant trickling clicks of ""Sink"" or the sharp, crisp snap-thump grooves that push along cuts like ""Places"" or ""Same Time"". Yet even the moments where the beat feels secondary to the other instrumentation have a pulse to them, run through floaty guitars or humming synthesizers that converse with the ambient hiss in compelling ways. Still, neither the melody nor the ambience overwhelms the other. It's easy to hear the silky, billowy tones through the dying-battery distortion, but hard to picture what they'd sound like without it."

Instead of aiming for retro-funk bullseye, they made the weirder, more ambitious Higher.","Steve Arrington is one of the great underheralded figures in funk, a drummer/vocalist who transitioned from lounge acts to gigs with the Escovedos before joining the Dayton funk band Slave for a five-year stretch of hitmaking. After a successful solo career stretching through most of the 80s, he left the business at the turn of the 90s for the ministry, about the same time as g-funk was starting to mine his catalog for inspiration and a kid from Pasadena named Damon Riddick was traversing over that same turf for his own early demos. The lineage is so clear and traceable that pairing up Dâm-Funk with the recently unretired Arrington seems like an intersection of a no-brainer homage and a dream come true. Anyone who's heard classics like “Just a Touch of Love,” “Weak at the Knees”, or “Dancin' in the Key of Life” can probably picture how natural and comfortable it'd sound for Arrington to jam over the spaced-out, smooth-gliding bounce of the style that made Toeachizown so immersive. Played straight and aiming right for the retro-funk bullseye would probably result in one of the most effortlessly crowdpleasing throwback records of the year.That's not quite what they did. Higher is messier than that, and weirder, and ultimately more ambitious. Instead of a straightforward selection of boogie jams that effortlessly recall 1982 and leave it at that, Arrington and Riddick put together something spontaneous, potentially polarizing, and joyously strange. Arrington's lost none of his range or power over the years, and he sounds instantly recognizable as the same man who laid a rubbery, often unearthly voice over tracks three decades ago. But he willfully goes off on odd tangents and improvised-sounding flights, spends a bit of time dodging a traditional on-the-one delivery for a more off-beat performance, and overall treats Dâm-Funk's backing track more like a suggestion to be elaborated on than an authoritative, meter-driving pulse. This is that rare record where the singer beats all the critics in the race to call a sound “angular”-- “that angular approach that's so funky and new,” to be specific, as he points out on “Tap That.” It's a phrase that touches on all the quirks and brow-furrowing curveballs that come with that territory.Granted, it's not that out of character for Dâm-Funk, though it does seem less experimental than he's been of late. Keeping in mind some of his more daring post-Toeachizown work, from his amped-up yet faithful cover of Human League's “Things That Dreams Are Made Of” to last year's New Wave-via-Minneapolis jam “I Don't Wanna Be a Star,” this feels a bit more like a reversion to still-funky, but less eclectic, turf. That means a lot of similar tempos, boom-clap drum machine patterns, and flowing chords-- sounds that barely stray from the Toeachizown palette-- and the musical simplicity threatens to fall into a droning sort of repetition, albeit a pleasant one. On the bright side, it never actually drags, and the production's still a good complement: it feels like Dâm-Funk decided to cede the spotlight to Arrington, leaving his work to buoy Arrington's voice, give him a springboard to riff off, and leaving the more eccentric touches to the singer himself."

Add alcohol, plus sleep deprivation to the already extant sensory deprivation, and the task becomes laughable. The vague occasion was the after-party to what had previously seemed the after-party, on the day after the last night of Trondheim's by:Larm festival, and thus it could have been nearly any time in the early or even late morning that we emerged out of cluster of warehouses and, ducking the wind off the snow and the nearby fjord, ascended the steps up into the third or fifth venue of the evening.Though we had been told otherwise, we did not expect the ""biker bar"" to which we had been referred to contain American-style bikers, to boast mounted Death Valley cow skulls and wall-to-wall worn-out leather jackets. And we did not expect the Moving Oos, which we knew as a side-project to the New Violators and were our last stop before the airport, to have much to do with ""classic rock""-- somewhere, somebody sketchily said, between the Faces and MC5. We expected them to sound like the New Violators: gauzy not bluesy, early 1980s not early 70s, good clothes and a dignified affect, not blue jeans and jean jackets.OK, that's not quite right. We knew their singer had worked as a truck driver and knew that Per Borten, the gifted music mimic, singer, and songwriter behind New Violators, wrote the Moving Oos' songs too. And we knew that the New Violators' occasional backup singer/siren was one of the two ""oos"" in that band's three-person vocal front (the two bands also share a drummer and keyboardist). Two of us had even seen the Oos the night before. But who could believe the same people carrying off such a brilliant American/English 80s pop resurrection could be doing the same thing later that evening for a completely different decade, the 1970s??Anybody who's heard Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones or the Black Crowes or AC/DC-- everybody-- will know what's coming in this music minutes before it actually happens, making Peace and Love a brain-teaser of a good record. How can we still enjoy this stuff: the bluesy lick, guitar or keys; the tambourine hits on the eights; the gesture skyward cued by women saying ""ooh""; the multi-tracked, song-title-based chorus? The motorcycle revs on ""Natural Man"", the ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" interpolation on ""Turn Back Time"", the ""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution"" intro on not one but two songs, ""Prisoner"" and ""Promised Land""?One answer is that Peace and Love is less homage than pretty close to the real thing, right place/wrong time, maybe, but right songs. What makes Peace and Love more than a joke or side-project or late night drunken escapism is something perhaps old fashioned or unfashionable, but it has to do with everyone in the band knowing how to sing, how to play their instruments, everyone knowing the exact moment on ""Romancer"" to get out of the way and let the two women deliver the second chorus by themselves, a shivery and sharp moment of clarity that says, just maybe, these guys know what they're about.It's easy to be taken by bands you see this way-- foreign place, foreign time, perfect for the exact moment they're stepping out into-- but the Moving Oos have no trouble pulling that space up by themselves, without help. Skeptics beware."

The 19th has one of the city’s largest concentrations of North African immigrants, including one of Paris’ fastest-rising musical stars. The rapper MHD, born to Senegalese and Guinean immigrants, has become a platinum-selling artist over the last several years, thanks to an ear for infectious, melodic beats and a talent for branding. On his second album, 19, the rapper born Mohamed Sylla attempts to demystify his home and proclaim his pride in it, joining the soccer player Kylian Mbappé as a young star hoping to change the national perception of what a Frenchman looks like.MHD has cannily labeled his music Afro-trap, linking it to the dominant strain of hip-hop in the world’s cultural superpower, but for the most part it bears little resemblance to the Atlanta sound. The songs on 19 rarely convey menace or even ennui; they are joyous, accessible, and highly melodic, making use of analog instruments, including more guitar than I’ve heard on a rap album in quite some time. The opening track features a lovely passage from Mali’s Salif Keita, a legend of Afropop—a sound that MHD raps over on the next song, “Encore,” claiming all the city’s neighborhood for himself and his crew.“Encore” is the first of many highlights, but it leads into a somewhat generic set of songs. 19 truly hits its stride on its sixth track, “Papalé,” which kicks off a series of infectious melodies that runs all the way through to “Bella,” another five tracks later. (The record is 19 tracks long; MHD is somewhat overcommitted to the concept.) He’s a more than competent rapper but what sets his songs apart is the same pleasurable eclecticism that made the fusion group the Very Best so exciting when they first emerged in 2008. MHD’s music has a similar rough, happy energy, as if cheer is a natural byproduct when two cultural styles speak on equal terms. He doesn’t always match his raps to the the beat—on “Papalé,” for instance, he’s in double time, ignoring the more moderate tempo of the drums—but his excellent ear for original, highly engaging instrumental work saves him any serious criticism on that front.He is at his strongest when displaying his softer side, often in collaboration with singers. “Bébé,” which features the Congolese-French singer Dadju, is filled with sweet nothings, but the breezy clicking beat comes alive during the hook, with a flute backing a powerful earworm of a hook. “Bella,” the song that features Wizkid, is similarly catchy, and MHD displays some narrative strength on the first verse, telling the story of a forbidden love. That Wizkid’s verse, delivered in English, is no more compelling than MHD’s underscores the charisma of the young Frenchman, who only uses a few English cognates, ones that generally belie his abilities on the mic. (“One two three for the money”; “Artist, businessman.”) Even when MHD adopts a tougher posture, some element of the music always betrays him as the fun-loving 20-something that he is. “Afro Trap Pt. 10,” part of a long-running series, may sound a touch more aggy, but a playful beat and hook make it clear that the track just represents a slightly different flavor of party music."

It’s just a thing that happens, and it doesn’t matter how many dates you enjoy or how many roses you buy. Some people will simply leave you in limbo—with lingering pain, unresolved questions and mounds of regret to sort through. It’s this same fog that permeates Michael Kiwanuka’s new album, Love & Hate, a sprawling soul opus full of longing and self-assessment. The singer sounds perplexed through its entirety, and his voice—a throaty wail the likes of Otis Redding—teeters between hope and hopelessness, perseverance and surrender. Should he stick around, or is it time to move on? And just what is he supposed to do now? Kiwanuka wrestles with these and other queries on Love & Hate, even if he never gets the answers he’s looking for.Even getting to that point has been a challenge. He won the BBC’s Sound of 2012 and was nominated for a UK Mercury Prize. Following the success of his gold-selling debut album, Home Again, Kiwanuka found himself in a weird space creatively, rubbing elbows with Kanye West, although he wasn’t sure if he belonged. At one point, West invited the UK singer/guitarist to sing on his Yeezus sessions in Hawaii and Paris. “I was lost, absolutely lost,” Kiwanuka told the London Evening Standard in May. “I just felt stupid sitting there with my acoustic guitar with all these producers and rappers. He didn’t tell me what he wanted … I wanted him to tell me what to do because I didn’t know how to do it.” Kiwanuka fuels his music with the same self-doubt, crafting nomadic tales of a man in perpetual movement and unrest. On Home Again, which combined Memphis soul and bluesy folk, Kiwanuka was the understated journeyman, thumbing through his desolation to find personal peace.For Love & Hate, Kiwanuka linked with producer Brian “Danger Mouse” Burton, best known for his work as one-half of Gnarls Barkley with Cee-Lo Green, and Broken Bells with Shins frontman James Mercer. Here, Burton brings Kiwanuka out of his shell, encouraging him to build songs from scratch in the studio, composing robust tracks that feel equally large and nostalgic. “Cold Little Heart”—the album’s 10-minute opener—is easily the record’s best song, landing somewhere between Pink Floyd’s soul/rock hybrid and Isaac Hayes’ orchestral arrangements. Throughout Love & Hate, Kiwanuka is backed by a full choir, which adds a richness not heard on his previous album. He doesn’t sound so isolated here, and the music itself feels grand and triumphant. On “Black Man in a White World,” Kiwanuka rides a jaunty Afrobeat instrumental to convey his inner racial strife: “I’m in love, but I’m still sad/I found peace, but I’m not glad.” In this instance, Kiwanuka speaks to the hearts of those who want the best out of humanity, even as the world implodes.Love & Hate is a bittersweet offering, pulling from ’60s and ’70s soul, growing more melancholy as it plays. And while it’s a creative step forward for Kiwanuka, it’s still tough to get a sense of just who he is at times. Names like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield immediately come to mind, and on “The Final Frame,” Kiwanuka’s spacious guitar chords recall Parliament Funkadelic’s Eddie Hazel. Kiwanuka takes pieces from these icons, resulting in a nice effort with occasional tedium, somewhat stalling the momentum. It’s clear Kiwanuka is still working through his angst. He'll need time to find inner tranquility."

I'm joined as always by the mookiest color commentary in the league, Bill Russell and Tom Tolbert. Guys, what do you think of this classic match-up, especially as it gets played by Aceyalone?Bill Walton: I got to tell you, when he first entered the league after his phenomenal showing at the Ronald McDonald Project Blowed game, I seriously thought he was the second coming. A powerful vocabulary, a vision encompassing the whole floor, commenting on the daily trials and tribulations-- as well as conscientious of the spiritual matters beyond-- and still funny and funky as well, putting it all together into the complete package for his breakthrough album, All Balls Don't Bounce. Criminally lost in the 1995 season, overwhelmed by the thuggish street ball of the East Coast Conference, it seems he's doubted himself since Capitol deleted the release and made it eBay fodder.Tom Tolbert: The game is playing Aceyalone these days. That non-materialistic, ""it's all good"" outlook embraced by the entire Left Coast contingency for years has led to a situation where they're seen as soft throwbacks when compared with the East, dominated on the Bill-boards and outscored on Soundscan points. Just look at the evolution from the peaceful outlook of his first album compared to the slightly tougher angle he takes on his newest, Love & Hate. I just don't believe it. Where was the weed-smoking, Crys-sipping and skin-hitting back then? He didn't need to resort to these tricks back then. I couldn't get behind the thematic, tepid thoughts on Book of Human Languages and Accepted Eclectic, but this season seems to be different for Acey.Bill Walton: It all starts with his supporting cast, guys. He needed the fatherly guidance and jazzy touch of producer Fat Jack on his first album, and it's nice to see him behind the glass again on ""The Sage Continues"". His old teammate from back in the day, Abstract Rude comes in for a few assists and timely treys, and it recalls that classic team of '95. He even brings the eternally winded Casual from Hieroglyphics off the bench for ""Let Me Hear Sumn"", which had the defense confused. His weight problems have always limited his player time, but for a moment, we see Casual and Acey engaged in the type of one-two game that we hoped to have seen when both of their records were glued to the decks eight years ago."

Recklessly irresponsible critics whose ideas of ""good"" and ""bad"" have been irreparably damaged by years of exposure to loads and loads of shitty music.2. Slimy publicist types that aren't afraid to trade a little fellatio for a winning review.3. The protecting hand of Yahweh.This goes a long way toward explaining the large majority of popular culture. But every once in a while, an album will make its way through reviewer after reviewer, deservedly earning absurdly high marks with nary a scratch. Such is the story with hip-hop's messiah of '99, Mos Def, and his solo debut, Black on Both Sides.But, in a sea of lousy, burnt-out critics, why should you believe me? For starters, nobody serviced me to write this. Not since the emergence of A Tribe Called Quest and Q-Tip (who makes a brief guest appearance here on Mr. Nigga"") has hip-hop seen an MC as intelligent, as lyrically proficient, and as baby-butt smooth as Mos Def.If you heard Def's previous outings with Black Star, you probably saw this coming. If you didn't, it's clearly time to put Ol' Dirty on that shelf reserved for insane, materialist misogynists, and repent. With artists like this finally getting the respect they deserve, we could be entering a new era of hip-hop. Think about it. When was the last time you heard an MC drop a line like, ""Mind over matter and soul before flesh""? When was the last time you heard somebody rap about the global economic and environmental consequences of first-world corporate waste and subsequent aquatic pollution? When was the last time you heard a hip-hopper sing competently over a phat-ass beat about the white appropriation of black art forms? Or end a song appropriately with a Bad Brains-influenced rockout, where both the drums and bass are played by the same guy?Mos Def. The man does it all-- addressing serious socio-political issues while remaining positive and affirmative from start to finish. Inspiring, no? The current state of punk and independent rock could stand to learn a thing or two from this man.True, Black on Both Sides isn't flawless. If you don't like Tribe-style laidback beats, you may have a more difficult time getting into this. Mos Def's singing on tracks like ""Climb"" and ""Umi Says"" is a bit hard to stomach, too. And then there's the matter of his sporadic introductory speeches, which occasionally sound like the pseudo-prophetic ramblings of a guy who might benefit from one less hit from the bong. But this, honestly, is nit-picking. Because when the beat drops and Def starts spitting his meticulously- crafted lyrics, you realize it's entirely possible that he truly is prophetic-- that he was meant to be kicking the rhymes, and that we were meant to listen."

Today, we revisit the debut album from Mase, an icon of the shiny suit era who turned the Bad Boy throne into a recliner.","Mase floats skyward wearing golden goggles and a shiny suit that looks like a tricked-out air traffic control vest. His rise through an ultramodern wind tunnel feels remarkably symbolic as Kelly Price lip-syncs Diana Ross’ “I’m Coming Out” on a monitor behind him. He’s wearing the same diamond-studded Jesus piece the Notorious B.I.G. had on when he was murdered. As he swaggers through the futuristic Hype Williams-directed music video for 1997’s “Mo Money, Mo Problems,” histories are being rewritten in real-time; the nature of rap as an epic retail commodity is growing. It is a eulogy and a coronation all at once. It is Bad Boy rising from the ashes.This was how Sean “Puffy” Combs, marketing extraordinaire, formally introduced a rebranded Mason Betha to the world. Despite guest starring on a No. 1 single months prior, this was Mase’s coming out party, the official induction of Bad Boy’s next star. For several years, Betha had been a foot soldier on the insular Harlem rap scene snarling about returning fire in shootouts, infrared beams, and slug-filled foes coughing up blood. Now he was nearly nonchalant, rapping about Dolce tube socks and putting his name on blimps. The transformation into a flashy ladykiller was Puff’s idea. “I was Murda, P. Diddy made me pretty,” Mase joked on a song called “Lookin’ at Me.”The transformation worked brilliantly and made Mase and Puff arguably more popular than any rappers before them, but it also raised questions about the value of style over substance among a classicist rap community that had just lost two icons to gun violence, the first Tupac Shakur, the other in their own camp. Puff, the man who’d brought hip-hop Biggie Smalls, one of its greatest ever rappers, was suddenly being pegged as an arbiter of bad taste, with Mase his steward in flamboyant emptiness. Initially seen as a sycophant riding Puff’s coattails, and then as an unworthy successor to Biggie, Mase was nearly defiant in his self-belief: “You don’t like me? Bet against me,” he rapped casually on “Niggaz Wanna Act.” That effortless confidence and poise defines his debut album, Harlem World, one of the best rap albums to be almost shamelessly commercial. It was the peak of the shiny suit era, sparking the short-lived jiggy rap phenomenon of the late ’90s.Mason Bethea was a New Yorker born in the South. Perhaps that’s why he seemed to do everything on his own time, why he talked slower than the big city rappers he grew up with. The youngest of six children, he was delivered almost two months early in Jacksonville, Florida, and he and his mother fled an abusive father, showing up unannounced to live with an uncle in Harlem. Unscheduled arrivals became a hallmark of his life. “I guess from the very beginning I was coming onto the scene before people were ready to see me,” he says in his 2001 pseudo memoir, Revelations: There’s a Light After the Lime. After leading the basketball team to the PSAL Finals his senior year at Manhattan Center High School, Betha and teammate Cameron Giles had dreams of going to the NBA, but when Betha was forced to repeat his senior year—which meant a year without playing ball—the friends picked up rap as a hobby. From the beginning, they were opposites. Cam was the fire; Mase was preternaturally chill."

After a slew of mixtapes, the Clayton County-raised rapper made her breakthrough with the lively 2019 single “Bitch From da Souf,” which became inescapable that summer and led her to sign with RCA for her studio debut, 2020’s Queen of da Souf. Nearly two years later, Latto, now 23, has continued to fine-tune her craft. Personal growth, along with public scrutiny, pushed her to change her stage name from Mulatto to Latto, meant to be short for “lottery” and representative of “a new chapter, good fortune, spiritually and financially.”With this rebrand, it’s clear that she’s still in the process of finding herself and her sound. She uses her second album, 777, to get reacquainted with fans and position herself for mainstream success. If you weren’t familiar with Latto before, the fiery and combative two-part intro “777 Pt. 1” and “777 Pt. 2” will quickly enlighten you: “Top two, and bitch, I ain’t number two/Real rap back and Latto is the proof,” she asserts.This newfound confidence allows her to venture away from her comfort zone and explore a more diverse selection of beats across the 13-track project, with mixed success. Lead single “Big Energy” aims to showcase her range with a fresh twist on Tom Tom Club’s “Genius of Love,” but misses the mark. The song sounds almost like a jingle, and Latto’s bars aren’t strong enough to revive the concept of “big dick energy,” a meme that by now feels a bit dated. “Real One” is a classic Pharrell production, with a bouncy, playful beat, but Latto’s flow makes an awkward fit, and her description of a relationship gone sour keeps the details at surface level.She’s more triumphant at flaunting her versatility on “Sunshine,” an unexpected feel-good anthem Latto has described as “hood gospel.” She goes toe to toe with guests Lil Wayne and Childish Gambino, venting about past betrayals and feeling grateful to move beyond them. “They use my couch when they needed the therapy,” she raps, then pivots to sing the hook: “I just let the sun shine on me.” It feels like the first warm summer day in the hood, having fun on the block with your people. It’s a fresh sound for Latto and one of the album’s high points.Opposite the more pop-influenced, upbeat tracks are R&B sounds—“Sleep Sleep,” which samples Twista’s “Get It Wet,” and “Like a Thug,” with Lil Durk—that offer a peek at a softer, more sultry side of Latto. She also taps into her more usual trap beats, saving some of her best rapping for the hard-hitting “Trust No Bitch” and “Stepper,” featuring Nardo Wick. 777 proves that Latto is a formidable force, though there’s still work to do to realize her full potential. If she hasn’t quite nailed down a winning sound, she’s willing to take some big gambles."

After his 2009 Interscope debut Attention Deficit bricked, selling a chastening 28,000 copies its first week, most presumed he would disappear soundlessly, like his fellow 2009 XXL Freshmen classmates Asher Roth and Charles Hamilton. He had failed to become a serious pop star, represent his D.C. hometown, or smuggle social consciousness into the rap mainstream-- his three bedrock campaign promises. But instead of disappearing, Wale caught the eye of Rick Ross, just as the Miami kingpin was transforming into commercial rap's all-devouring center of gravity, and climbed aboard Rozay's ascendant Maybach Music Group. Ambition, the result of a pairing nobody saw coming, inaugurates the curious second phase of Wale Folarin's increasingly fascinating career.The record is a testament to the virtue in the album's title. Never say Wale doesn't learn from mistakes: Everything that dragged down Attention Deficit, from hipster-baiting to its bewildering guest roster, has been jettisoned, along with introspection and any lingering modicum of respect for women. On Ambition, Wale is reborn as an unrepentantly shallow strip-club rapper, and the production is a gleaming phalanx of freshly minted beats from Ross' MMG assembly line. The album is unmistakably a product of Planet Boss, the lurid neon kingdom of B-movie saxes and cartoon excess in which Rick Ross has built his empire. And Ambition provides a remarkably effective demonstration in how a shpritz of Planet Boss can jumpstart a flagging rapper's fortunes.Wale's complete persona 180 will strike his original fanbase as repellantly cynical, and there is something vaguely unsavory and disorienting in the eagerness with which he embraces his new role. But it turns out that many of the gifts that got him noticed in the first place-- a nimble tongue, a high-stepping flow-- lend themselves as well to flossy nonsense about watches and women as they did to examining the sociopolitical implications of Soundscan. And Ambition is a high-velocity parade of flossy nonsense, with an extremely dense ratio of Headslaps-Per-Minute: ""I'm sort of like Socrates in a Prada T""; ""I aspire for awesome/ That requires some flossin'""; ""Fuck rap, I get pussy off of haiku."" There is a Sandra Bullock namedrop that references the 1992 sci-fi comedy Love Potion No. 9. Everything is fast-moving, breezily entertaining, and patently ridiculous.Even swilling champagne at the winners' table, however, Wale remains something less than ""fun."" He always had the gift for seeing the negative that you might expect from someone who structured an entire mixtape around clips of old Seinfeld dialogue, and it rears its head in a lot of ranting about silencing his critics. ""Sippin Moscato with models, havin exotic dishes/ But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected,"" he gripes on ""Don't Hold Your Applause"". And his smooth-loverman approach, bluntly, needs fine-tuning: on the treacly slow jam ""Lotus Flower Bomb"", he offers the hilariously stilted compliment ""Took you forever to get dressed/ I acknowledge your effort."" Uh, thanks, Wale!"

When discussing the label's recent compilation Expanse at Low Levels with Percussion Lab, he gave some advice to aspiring electronic artists: ""If you got a hook and you can write a song and keep it at two-and-a-half minutes long, and I want to hear it over and over, that's going to make me want to email you back."" Like most ambient or low-level music-- Tim Hecker's touchstone Ravedeath, 1972, Laurie Spiegel's machine music, and electronic pioneers like Otto Luening-- Loyal is devoid of those hooks in the traditional sense, the tension and release that evokes the visceral reaction of wanting to hear something again and again.Listening to ""Ringing Temple"", the album's echoing, urgently polyrhythmic centerpiece that probably draws the most from Alexander's other work as a DJ alongside slow-motion disco outfit Worst Friends and Matthew Dear, there seemed nothing that could have emerged as a hook over its two-and-a-half minutes. Once I watched a teaser video for the song, however, I got it. I played the 45 seconds of geometrically spiraling incandescence over and over again. The visual, which looked a lot like the type of graphic art that saturates ISO50, activated certain pleasure centers that the song's steady repetition hadn't; the experience changed the way I heard much of the album afterward. In that respect, Loyal is similar to Hansen's work, which traffics similar principles of music as a means to aesthetics.In his review of Tycho's Dive, Joe Colly said the album's downfall was its lack of tension. The same can be said of Loyal: even though the tension and release of Alexander's emotional struggles is part and parcel of the record, the album as a whole is meant to function as a reprieve from his anxiety. ""Beach Shelter"", which pulses with a low-range that threatens to engulf the track in an abyss of noise, and ""Lower Dome"", sparkling with synthesizers that might soundtrack interstitial plotting scenes in an 80s heist film, are vaguely disquieting. Still, they find their antitheses in the sweet relief of droning micro-permutations on the six-minute ""Raising Our Ashes"", and the similar, appropriately named ""Docile Touch"". Because these mood swings happen over the course of the album, however, they lack the urgency that characterizes a sought-after hook, which would give the album more presence.That's not to say Loyal would benefit from instant gratification; rather definition. For the last song on the album, veteran Dutch producer Markus Guentner remixes ""Lower Dome"" to allow a glimpse into what the record might have sounded like if Alexander brought more of his Worst Friends disco sensibility to the table. (According to Heathered Pearls' page on Ghostly International's site, Alexander ""always comes back to disco."") Guentner drops in a softly ticking house beat like something weighing on your mind, steadily increasing it in volume, dropping it out, and bringing it back with variegated beats, all with an acute sense of timing. It's not much, but it sharpens the synthesized drift and gives the song more of a purpose and destination. Plus, it's just more fun. And that might be the best way to alleviate stress."

In that respect, Loyal is similar to Hansen's work, which traffics similar principles of music as a means to aesthetics.In his review of Tycho's Dive, Joe Colly said the album's downfall was its lack of tension. The same can be said of Loyal: even though the tension and release of Alexander's emotional struggles is part and parcel of the record, the album as a whole is meant to function as a reprieve from his anxiety. ""Beach Shelter"", which pulses with a low-range that threatens to engulf the track in an abyss of noise, and ""Lower Dome"", sparkling with synthesizers that might soundtrack interstitial plotting scenes in an 80s heist film, are vaguely disquieting. Still, they find their antitheses in the sweet relief of droning micro-permutations on the six-minute ""Raising Our Ashes"", and the similar, appropriately named ""Docile Touch"". Because these mood swings happen over the course of the album, however, they lack the urgency that characterizes a sought-after hook, which would give the album more presence.That's not to say Loyal would benefit from instant gratification; rather definition. For the last song on the album, veteran Dutch producer Markus Guentner remixes ""Lower Dome"" to allow a glimpse into what the record might have sounded like if Alexander brought more of his Worst Friends disco sensibility to the table. (According to Heathered Pearls' page on Ghostly International's site, Alexander ""always comes back to disco."") Guentner drops in a softly ticking house beat like something weighing on your mind, steadily increasing it in volume, dropping it out, and bringing it back with variegated beats, all with an acute sense of timing. It's not much, but it sharpens the synthesized drift and gives the song more of a purpose and destination. Plus, it's just more fun. And that might be the best way to alleviate stress."

After his 2009 Interscope debut Attention Deficit bricked, selling a chastening 28,000 copies its first week, most presumed he would disappear soundlessly, like his fellow 2009 XXL Freshmen classmates Asher Roth and Charles Hamilton. He had failed to become a serious pop star, represent his D.C. hometown, or smuggle social consciousness into the rap mainstream-- his three bedrock campaign promises. But instead of disappearing, Wale caught the eye of Rick Ross, just as the Miami kingpin was transforming into commercial rap's all-devouring center of gravity, and climbed aboard Rozay's ascendant Maybach Music Group. Ambition, the result of a pairing nobody saw coming, inaugurates the curious second phase of Wale Folarin's increasingly fascinating career.The record is a testament to the virtue in the album's title. Never say Wale doesn't learn from mistakes: Everything that dragged down Attention Deficit, from hipster-baiting to its bewildering guest roster, has been jettisoned, along with introspection and any lingering modicum of respect for women. On Ambition, Wale is reborn as an unrepentantly shallow strip-club rapper, and the production is a gleaming phalanx of freshly minted beats from Ross' MMG assembly line. The album is unmistakably a product of Planet Boss, the lurid neon kingdom of B-movie saxes and cartoon excess in which Rick Ross has built his empire. And Ambition provides a remarkably effective demonstration in how a shpritz of Planet Boss can jumpstart a flagging rapper's fortunes.Wale's complete persona 180 will strike his original fanbase as repellantly cynical, and there is something vaguely unsavory and disorienting in the eagerness with which he embraces his new role. But it turns out that many of the gifts that got him noticed in the first place-- a nimble tongue, a high-stepping flow-- lend themselves as well to flossy nonsense about watches and women as they did to examining the sociopolitical implications of Soundscan. And Ambition is a high-velocity parade of flossy nonsense, with an extremely dense ratio of Headslaps-Per-Minute: ""I'm sort of like Socrates in a Prada T""; ""I aspire for awesome/ That requires some flossin'""; ""Fuck rap, I get pussy off of haiku."" There is a Sandra Bullock namedrop that references the 1992 sci-fi comedy Love Potion No. 9. Everything is fast-moving, breezily entertaining, and patently ridiculous.Even swilling champagne at the winners' table, however, Wale remains something less than ""fun."" He always had the gift for seeing the negative that you might expect from someone who structured an entire mixtape around clips of old Seinfeld dialogue, and it rears its head in a lot of ranting about silencing his critics. ""Sippin Moscato with models, havin exotic dishes/ But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected,"" he gripes on ""Don't Hold Your Applause"". And his smooth-loverman approach, bluntly, needs fine-tuning: on the treacly slow jam ""Lotus Flower Bomb"", he offers the hilariously stilted compliment ""Took you forever to get dressed/ I acknowledge your effort."" Uh, thanks, Wale!"

Three years later, lead singer Shogun might have worked to temper his powerful soul shout and the production is cleaner, but the songs are just as catchy and full of emotion.","A recent Royal Headache show at the Sydney Opera House got stopped by police. During ""Down the Lane"", fans crashed the stage en masse, and when the chorus hit, they sang it as hard as they could. The scene became more raucous as the band sped into ""Girls"", and that's when cops eventually muscled the crowd off stage. A woman who'd eluded the wall of neon-vested officers took the mic and said, ""I love you, Shogun."" She was speaking to the band's sweaty, shirtless frontman who'd just been singing his heart out, lost somewhere in the mass of bodies.Royal Headache have earned this beer-slinging, shout-along adulation fair and square. The songs of 2012's Royal Headache were catchy, loud, fuzzy, and frantic, and Shogun's voice has absurd range, plenty of force, and soul. It took three years to follow up on this debut, and with High they waste no time charging back in. On opener ""My Own Fantasy"", Shogun belts ""I used to live in a world of rock'n'roll and tons of girls!"" over a chugging, high-power intro. At a glance, it seems he's going through rock-god motions—romanticizing guitar music while extolling the virtues of fucking multiple strangers. Really, though, the song is about that bubble finally bursting—the sudden, cold feeling of loneliness even while fans are singing along and dancing all around you.If there's an underlying sense of dissatisfaction here, it's safe to assume it might have something to do with the band's emotional state over the past year. In one interview, Shogun said he broke the band up due to their ""dysfunctional"" dynamic. (It was later clarified that they weren't breaking up after all.) In a statement, he said the whole album is ""about someone I don't see anymore."" The open wounds of relationship turmoil fuel High. The band are frenzied on ""Need You"", one of the best songs in their repertoire (buoyed significantly by Gabrielle de Giorgio's organ line). It's a song about professing love to no avail and eventually having those feelings decay into fruitless obsession. On ""Another World"", Shogun accuses the person he's with of judging him for superficial reasons. Both songs are as melodic and upbeat as anything on their debut.Shogun labors over his vocals in the recording process, and his care shows. He could easily soul-scream all over the place, but instead he holds off on the high notes until the perfect moment comes around. He simmers calmly while addressing someone running scared from new love on ""Wouldn't You Know"". He's dismissive and contemptuous on ""Garbage"". When he does let loose, it's almost disorienting. He belts over and over during ""Love Her If I Tried"", and just when he appears to be going at full power, he seems to momentarily unhinge his jaw for one enormous, cathartic high note.They still thrive on adrenaline and huge sing-along choruses, and ""High"" and ""Electric Shock"" deliver the dependable goods. They're not just going through the motions, though. ""Carolina"", with its acoustic underpinnings, is a surprisingly pastoral plea. The hook is indelible, stirring memories of other people singing the words ""sweet Caroline"". As ever, it's catchy and full of emotion. Royal Headache have taken steps forward since their last album—they’ve cleaned up their production and diversified their songwriting. Ultimately, though, the important bits are intact: the passion, the power, and the hooks that demand being shouted joyfully."

They recorded the rabid 28-minute Vol. 1 with their friend (and sometimes employee) Ty Segall.,"Liz Tooley and Lance Barresi run two record stores in Chicago and L.A., both called Permanent Records. They frequently host inexpensive, all-ages in-store shows—during their early goings in Chicago, artists like Kurt Vile, Thee Oh Sees, Times New Viking, Vivian Girls, and others would perform there before playing the Empty Bottle later on. With their label, they release music from the fringes—psychedelic, beefy, muddy, weird, loud—by bands with names like Rectal Hygienics and King Blood. Every Monday, they thoughtfully curate picks for their record store's weekly newsletter. They named cats after Betty Davis and Zaireeka. These are the sort of people you root for. They're two-thirds of the L.A.-based garage punk trio Endless Bummer.Quality isn't ever a guarantee for a new band, but consider: These people are first-rate curators who have run a consistently great label for almost a decade. Lance is a former member of the overlooked Chicago band Heavy Times. The third member is Greg T., a guitarist whose credits include work with the coldwave outfit MERX (whose two albums were released by Permanent) and the skate punk heroes the Spits. And right as the band got started, they packaged themselves with some well-tread rock'n'roll traditions. All three adopted the surname ""Bummer"" (a la Ramone, Davila, Partridge) and a uniform (all black, sunglasses, scowls). In the video for their debut single ""Such a Drag"", they got doused with blood. These are the sorts of rock'n'roll tropes that border on gimmickry, but in this case, their ""we're the Bummers"" narrative helps keep the focus on their angry (and often violent) music. Endless Bummer aren't simply ""co-owners of a record store plus another guy who's been in some bands."" They're the angry voices repeating the words ""it's time to say goodbye"" and ""I don't like you.""They recorded Vol. 1 with their friend (and sometimes employee) Ty Segall at his short-lived home studio ""the Sweat Lodge."" That guy's reputation practically guaranteed that the guitars on the record would sound awesome—his backyard set-up produced successful sessions for White Fence, Wand, and Meatbodies, after all. Within seconds, those few opening strums of ""Gray"" portent the entire album's tone: This is brazen, blown-out, fuzz-caked, and dour rock'n'roll.The Endless Bummer approach becomes quickly apparent. They're not the band to deliver the unhinged, wild-eyed screams you get from rock'n'roll's magnetic icons. Liz's drumming is more skeletal than flashy; Lance and Greg's vocals hover in the middle space between ""scream"" and ""monotone."" (The vocals on ""Speed Queen"" lean a little Lemmy, actually.) But this is a band that puts a premium on the numbers game. The vocals become vicious and beefy when barked by two dudes in unison; the onslaught of power chords doesn't relent. Their attack is emboldened by their hooks, which make a few stylistic shifts over the album's 28 minutes. Regardless of whether they're tapping into surf, blues, or punk influences, it all comes out in the wash sounding like Endless Bummer. It's churning, trashy rock music.Vol. 1's lyrics are arguably most instrumental in defining the band's sullen, furious tone. They've got three songs about the beach (""High Tide"", ""Rip Tide"", ""Nuclear Beach"") which are the inverse of Frankie & Annette's white-bread beach blanket fantasies. These are the beaches of exploitation films—kids drinking out of paper bags, nude old guys shooting up in the shade, people getting swallowed by the riptide. Over the stilted minor chord churn of ""B Movie"", they blurt a concise, satisfying kiss-off: ""I don't need you, you don't need me/ That's the way it's always gonna be."" Their mentality seems most clear on ""Bad News"": ""I'll crash your car, trash your home, hang around when you're alone."" The people wearing all black are sending a clear message here: they've been hurt one too many times, and now it's time to destroy something and/or someone."

The band's best moments are born out of extended repitition, studio experimentation, and reckless amateurism. If you didn't know better, you might think that the San Francisco quartet's murky single-chord jams were unearthed from some long-forgotten record crate-- an acetate sandwiched for ages in between two moldy Tangerine Dream LPs-- rather than conceived within the last couple of years.Vol. 1 collects Wooden Shjips first three vinyl-only releases-- including ""Shrinking Moon For You"" 10"", the ""Dance California/Clouds Over Earthquake"" 7"", and the ""SOL '07"" 7""-- onto a single LP. Together that's six songs and a scant 35 minutes of music, but the compilation contains Wooden Shjips' fullest sounding work.Formed by guitarist Ripley Johnson in the early part of the decade, Wooden Shjips' began by honing in on the mantric drone vibe of bands like Velvet Underground and Pärson Sound. By recruiting non-musicians-or forcing skilled musicians to play unfamiliar instruments, Johnson prevailed in reducing improvised space-rock into a relatively focused product. Wooden Shjips' music still unspools into the ether beyond rational thought, but it does so with relatively predictable results.The songs that make up Wooden Shjips self-released debut single-- the ""Shrinking Moon For You"" 10""-- nail the necessary narcotic feel. Originally pressed in a limited run of only 300 units, the band gave the record away at performances and mailed them out to people who requested copies. After a few positive reviews the 10"" went quickly out of print as collectors and fans scooped them up, creating a buzz around a group that might have otherwise slipped into obscurity. ""Shrinking Moon For You"" is Wooden Shjips finest moment thus far. It's eight and a half minutes of foreboding lo-fi bashing and Schedule 1 substance buzz-- a single two-note bass riff is repeated ad infinitum while a guitars and keyboards ascend up the register and into abstraction. Everything is distorted, convoluted, and delayed. The motorik rhythm sounds like it was made by shaking a drawer full of kitchen utensils.B-side ""Death's Not Your Friend"" treads simillar thrillingly haphazard territory-- guitars ping-pong across the stereo field, anchored by a thrift store organ that sounds like a car alarm. Meanwhile, ""Clouds Over Earthquake"" inverts the formula. Here Wooden Shjips abscond with lysergic chugging for a languid a new age haze. Skeletal guitar melodies float over the refrigerator hum of a distorted keyboard, as Johnson moans distant and blissed out nonsense.In comparison to the best songs on Vol. 1, Wooden Shjips debut full-length-- also on Holy Mountain-- was disappointing. The band stripped down too far, peeling off a layer of murk and toning down the stoner kinetics, leaving only thin and anemic grooves that sounded like Morrison Hotel pitched down two octaves. A few tracks even broke the Velvet Underground's cardinal rule--""never play the blues."" But Vol. 1 finally makes Wooden Shjips first, fuzzier, efforts easily available. And for these songs, one chord is still more than enough."

Over a gently strummed guitar and gently tapped triangle, the former Speedwell member arcs his whispery voice across a plaintive melody, enunciating higher notes for a lyrical phrase before descending again to a more comfortable range. Singing just above his natural level, Bragg crafts the tune and the performance for maximum poignancy. It's the work of a bright student: a little self-conscious and overeager, but nevertheless affecting.On the other hand, the lyrics on ""Work and Winter"" are particularly Gibbardesque: ""Smiling as I felt your breathing align/ In alliance with mine."" It would be a little rash to dismiss Bragg and his Terminals as just another troupe of pop-sensitive, heart-on-sleeve folkies. Admittedly, most of Vol. 1 draws heavily from obvious sources, and most of the ideas here will be familiar to anyone who's heard Nick Drake, Death Cab for Cutie, or the New Year. And yes, the album's aesthetic of failure-- its tendency toward extreme self-reckoning-- derives from Smith's canon of introverted and expressive songs. However, despite these influences and even despite its Decemberistical album art, Vol. 1 transcends any accusation of imitation: These 11 tracks have their own high stakes and dire consequences and seem as specific to Bragg himself as Smith's were to him, as Gibbard's are to him.Instead of mining Smith's sense of self-compromise or entertaining the DCFC frontman's romantic whimsy, Bragg writes lyrics that are more plainspoken and austere in their jadedness. He's wary of relationships on the bare-bones ""Early Sign"", surprised that he can be guardedly hopeful on ""Carolina"", and, over uncorrected guitar flubs, sweetly reminiscent on ""Seventeen"". All of this introspection is couched in music that is at once intimate yet expansive, concise yet darkly atmospheric, understated yet occasionally powerful. Bragg sings in a soft voice, carefully enunciating his syllables as if uncertain he'll be understood. Only when he alters his voice for ""Waltz No. 1"" does the album falter, but elsewhere his risks pay off. Bragg spends half of the seven-and-a-half-minute ""I Won't Let You Down"" half-humming the short melody over and over, stoically building to something uncertain yet ineluctable.That ""I Won't Let You Down"" sounds so confident and immediate is not just to Bragg's credit, but also to the credit of the Terminals, who prevent Vol. 1 from descending gravitationally into dreariness. Jonathan Roth's drums propel the melodies and anchor Bragg to the world, while Elizabeth Olson's cello adds tremulous gravity to tracks like the short ""Before the Storm"" and ""Bitter at Best"". But it's Brian Minter who adds most to the band's sound and helps make it distinct from their forebears. His piano makes a perfect foil for Bragg's mechanistic guitar rhythms on the propulsive closer, ""Shattering"", and his ""Vibraphonic Devices"" evoke a noir chiaroscuro on the dark ""My Own Worst Enemy"". Bragg and the Terminals may not have pioneered their sound, but they sound perfectly at home all the same."

Have the enfants terribles of French house grown up?","Justice’s 2007 debut album, †, was expertly engineered for breakthrough success, delivering massive hooks with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. That said, they also had an impeccable sense of timing. Shortly after reigniting public interest in their catalog with the landmark Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk—Justice’s direct antecedents—largely powered down until the release of 2013’s Random Access Memories. It’s difficult to overstate how much Justice benefitted from this timing, riding a renewed wave of interest in French house just as it was cresting, then stepping into a world hungry for Daft Punk as their closest analogues: two enigmatic French dudes forcing electro-disco through the sieve of hard rock dynamics. They certainly made the most of the opportunity on the live circuit, with ear-splitting arena tours that predicted the rise of pyrotechnic technicians like Skrillex and Deadmau5. Still, for all their success, Justice always felt like Daft Punk’s understudies: cruder, grimier, more willing to dredge rock’s cheesiest depths in search of a big hook.That formula worked well in 2007 but now that Daft Punk is active and operating at pop’s highest echelons, does the world still need Justice? That’s the question the scruffy duo have been attempting to answer ever since. To their credit, they’ve hardly stood still: 2011’s Audio, Video, Disco found the act taking a hard left turn toward prog in order to distinguish themselves. Woman, their  latest, marks yet another tonal shift away from the leather-clad sonics of their debut and toward the brighter sounds of pop and disco.They’ve stored away the crates of vinyl once and for all, padding out their synthcraft with live instrumentation and vocalists. As with previous Justice albums, Woman is full of earnest vocals, rubber-band basslines and weepy strings, only this time everything sounds much warmer and looser. Intentional or not, it’s hard not to see the parallels to Random Access Memories’ pop classicism and militantly analog approach. Just as Daft Punk did, Justice attempt to envelop the sounds of disco and funk in a full on, unironic embrace. And while they remain more willing to violate the rules of good taste (as always, all the faders are at 10 and they continue cramming everything into the midrange), Woman still feels about as “electronic” as RAM does: it largely scans as AM pop, just with more modular synths.Justice being Justice, they can’t resist trying to land a few big singles and these songs tend to be the least adventurous on the album. “Safe and Sound” and “Stop” both attempt to recreate the winning formula of “D.A.N.C.E.”: stargazing choirs, layers of synths, a generous helping of slap bass. At best though, these songs feel like paint-by-numbers versions of Justice’s early singles. In between these throwbacks, we get a lot of middle-of-the-road pop: generically funky melodies, cheesy guitar solos, forgettable vocals, lyrics that are downright embarrassing. It’s not quite offensive but that’s also kind of the problem—much of Woman sounds like music designed by committee, better suited to soundtrack a car commercial than to actively engage the listener (incidentally, Justice do have a pretty strong track record when it comes to landing commercial and video game placements)."

Woman, her fifth studio album, is slow in the way that the familiar is slow: we already know what to expect. With Scott, it's mom-and-pop, all-you-can-eat R&B; sexy fun for grown folk over the age of 40, like speed dating at church.Woman's first track, ""Wild Cookie"", initially seems like a spoken word ode to ""Empire""'s Cookie Lyon, but the lyrics quickly suggest that ""Cookie"" is a euphemism for the vagina. ""Wild Cookie choices lead to lonely pregnancy,"" Scott says over strings and drums. The vagina in ""Wild Cookie"", personified, acts on its own. Desirous, it does not have a mind of its own, but it would seem that way. ""Just the other day my girlfriend said she was watching TV and her wild cookie detached from its seat."" That detachment, that Jill speaks of—that desire—is a magnetizing energy.Beyond ""Wild Cookie"", there are other food references. After all, Scott perpetually sings like she's about to cook dinner for a family that isn't even hers. She wants domesticity, craves it. ""Prepared"", the track that follows the intro poem, has the lyrics ""I've been getting recipes off the Internet"" and ""I've been eating more greens"", which come as no surprise for anyone who's ever listened to ""The Way"" off her first album. Food is a big part of Scott's music. Additionally, in the track ""Closure"", Scott sings about not making a man quiches and homemade waffles anymore, how he shouldn't expect breakfast.""I'm on my way, I'm almost there,"" Scott sings in ""Coming to You"", a percussion-laden, breathless track, the most urgent on a decidedly slow record. ""Coming to You"" is a funky, upbeat jam, but for a faster song, it's not necessarily more fun. The fun tracks are the ones that shimmer. ""Fool's Gold"", arguably the best song, is about a disillusioned Scott who finds herself in a relationship that might as well have been a pipe dream. ""I was living the dream/ Believing things that just ain't true/ Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you/ Had me chasing fool's gold,"" she sings over a bouncy, enchanting instrumental. Another strong track is ""Lighthouse"", a somberly reassuring lullaby of a ballad about supporting a lover through trying, burdensome times. ""I'm your shelter,"" Scott sings like an overprotective siren, striking a balance between sexy and soothing.Intimate and slow-moving, Woman is good but underwhelming. It lacks the dynamism of Who Is Jill Scott?**, the rap features of Light of the Sun. What was new, interesting, and different 15 years ago isn't anymore. Scott's mastered the formula of candlelit, slow-cooker music. Her sense of humor and sensuality, fine-tuned, endearing and bold, is infused throughout this album, but it doesn't feel like enough. It misses the mark, like a lot of great music does, because it's less inventive."

Together, they make ethereal R&B focusing on world-tilting romantic experience, with gorgeous minimal production that leaves little space between the listener and the songs.","Rhye's short history is marked by serendipity and mystery. A couple of years ago, after being tapped by Hannibal's Copenhagen-based electronic group Quadron, producer/vocalist Mike Milosh flew to Denmark to work with the group and they hit it off. Eventually, Quadron producer Robin Hannibal moved to L.A. in pursuit of a woman, and Milosh coincidentally relocated there as well, and started his own serious relationship (which has since evolved into a marriage) before they reconnected musically.From what Milosh has said, Rhye's primary goal is to pay tribute to this type of world-tilting romantic experience, but so far the pair have delivered their interpretations of this very personal phenomenon from behind a veil of secrecy. They released their first single, ""Open"", anonymously, and promoted it in a deliberately opaque fashion, like a YouTube video of Milosh serenading his wife with a solo piano rendition of the song, shot in a way where you can barely make him out in silhouette. Even after revealing their identities, the pair refuse to say where the group's name comes from or what it means, and their full names don't appear anywhere in the liner notes to their debut album, Woman.Even without a face to attach it to, Rhye's music itself feels deeply intimate. Much of this comes from Hannibal and Milosh's deft arrangements-- each of Woman's 10 songs makes its point with a bare minimum of moving parts. Beats, basslines, and Milosh's voice are at the center of nearly all of them; although a majority of the tracks boast arrangements for horns and strings, most of these are so subtle that you might not even realize they're there until you read the liner notes afterward. The lean production leaves little space between the listener and the songs, and they feel almost touchably close.And then of course there's Milosh's voice itself, a gorgeous and graceful countertenor that many listeners have mistaken for a woman's, especially in the days before the group unmasked themselves. He's a subtle performer, but also canny. The restraint that the pair shows in their arrangements also carries over to his singing, which rarely rises above the volume of a conversation. It's gentle, soothing, and easy to get lost in.That voice has drawn a number of comparisons to Sade, and the music behind it only underlines those similarities. Woman offers few sounds or ways of deploying them that wouldn't be familiar to an R&B fan in the 90s, especially if they were into the British wing of the genre that at the time was focused on making gently bumping, slightly jazzy bedroom music."

Relocated from the American South to southern Spain, Herren fell in love with Barcelonan culture and music and recycled his former post-rock alias, Savath & Savalas, as an interpreter of Catalan folk music with this year's Apropa't LP. On paper, it sounded as if Herren would be applying his unique micro-editing CTRL-X/CTRL-V talents to another land's musical heritage, having already reprocessed the American tropes of jazz and hip-hop under his flagship moniker, Prefuse 73. Instead, Herren put his skittering rhythms in storage and produced a much softer album, like a romantic evening over a bottle of Rioja, a pot of paella, and sundry other stereotypically Spanish things.For those who thought they could forecast Herren's tactics, Apropa't was a surprise and, very likely, a disappointment. (""Oh gross, is this world music?!?"") Yet the project accomplished what Herren himself was likely looking to do: introduce his fans to the Catalan music of S&S; singer Eva Puyuelo Muns with a minimum of distraction and interpretation.But Herren has built a career on recontextualization-- be it of dusty vinyl excavations or his own compositions-- and this follow-up EP gives him space to exercise those strengths. 2003's Extinguished EP built a banquet out of leftovers from Prefuse 73's One Word Extinguisher album, mixing stray beats and found sound into a fully-developed companion piece. Mañana is also a re-imagination of source material; it's eight original songs that spin the Barcelona travelogue of Apropa't in a new direction.The first element one hears on Mañana is a cut-up, hiccuping vocal sample-- an immediate indication that Herren is using the EP to inject his Prefuse 73 methodology into the Savath & Savalas sound. Though the track is titled ""Interludio Inconcreto"", it might as well be an overture for the half-hour of music to follow. A beat-less swirl of abrupt string swells and disconnected syllables, the piece retains the hazy atmosphere of Apropa't while happily shirking traditional instrumentation and arrangement. ""Demà Vindrà"" accomplishes a similar feat, preserving the whispery vocals of Herren and Muns that dominate Apropa't but sautéing them on a bed of sampled string-plucks, static crackles, and headphone-hopping ooo's.Less subtle is ""Sota L'Aigüa"", on which an initial passage of soft singing and gentle backwards loops runs headlong into a surprise appearance by the kind of beat programming tweaked to perfection on One Word Extinguisher. For two minutes, this drum flurry gives Herren's Barcelonan project its strongest backbone, adding helpful variety to what was oftentimes on Apropa't a sound too weightless to leave an impression. ""No Puedo de Cidir"" is no less jarring when placed alongside traditional compositions; it sounds like a Tortoise outtake got mixed in with the S&S; masters at John McEntire's Soma Studios.The EP crests with ""Equipatage de Flors Seques"", wherein Herren gets all ""Revolution 9"" on his Barcelona period by pitting tetherless piano ramblings against loop fuckery that only coalesces for one short stretch. It's an intentionally disorienting take on the indigenous music at the project's core, and one wonders what Herren's collaborator Muns thinks of the final product-- and whether it's a coincidence that Mañana is rumored to be their final collaboration. But it's difficult to ignore that the track is far more interesting and dense than anything on Apropa't, at least to this typically foreign-culture-ignorant American. Mañana finds Herren working up the nerve to interpret the music of his adopted Spanish home instead of merely documenting it, and the results allow the EP to easily outshine its shy big brother."

On “Olorun,” the meditative opener to his second album, Work of Art, he extols the Supreme Being of the Yoruba religion before praising himself. “I’m a brand new man,” he proclaims. Ahmed Ololade’s first love was dancing, but as much as he loved feeling the music, he knew the best way to make money was to become a consummate artist. He took up singing and adopted a stage name, and after a steady stream of singles he released his first full-length, Mr. Money With the Vibe, in 2022. It became Billboard’s highest-charting debut album from a Nigerian artist. He was, undoubtedly, a star.Asake’s first album was the culmination of ideas percolating throughout his home country. Most notably, it was amapiano—a strain of South African house music in the lineage of kwaito—that brought Asake’s Afrofusion music to another level. This regional style was already spreading across the continent—in Tanzania and Kenya, Namibia and Mozambique—and fellow Nigerians like Davido and Mayorkun were collaborating with South Africans to meld it with Afrobeats. What separated Asake from his peers was how he forged a sound all his own: He incorporated choral harmonies and string arrangements, and worked in elements of the Indigenous Yoruba music known as fújì. The opening track on his debut announced this audacious blend: “Dull” interpolated “Oke Agba” from the pioneering fújì musician Ayinde Barrister.With Work of Art, Asake understands that his winning formula needs no adjustments. Wistful strings inject solemnity on “What’s Up My G,” and as the characteristic log-drum loop of amapiano establishes a lithe beat, he expertly switches between vocal rhythms and inflections. There are many shades to his wealth, his nimble delivery implies. And when he lists off designer brands and luxury cars, the host of voices behind him frame his braggadocio as a spiritual act. “If you don’t feel blessed, you won’t be blessed,” he recently told ABC News. It sounds like the flipside to a Yoruba òwe, or proverb: “Ẹní lówó kó ṣe bí ọba” (“Whoever has riches should act like a king”).These two pithy statements reflect Asake’s own mindset of manifestation: His songs often read as a proposition that anyone who hustles can experience the blessings he’s had. On “Basquiat,” he makes sure to let you know that the “work of art” his album title refers to is, indeed, himself. Still, the song’s group chants remind you that celebration can and should be a communal act. Perhaps that’s why he’s so drawn to amapiano, a style of music that South African artist Thandiswa Mazwai has said reflects “how radical Black joy can be.” Inevitably, some of the most irresistible songs on Work of Art are cheery. “Sunshine” is an encouraging balm, its bubbly synths and rising vocal harmonies capturing the warmth of time spent with loved ones. “Awodi” is less summery but just as hopeful. Asake sings about rising from the slums, and his slow, patient delivery feels like he’s extending an arm to lift you up beside him.Stories of rebirth are nothing new, but Asake’s feel revelatory because they’re in constant search of innovation. “Amapiano” sheds some light on his approach. If the amapiano coming from South Africa is more tied to the country’s dance lineage, then Asake is intent on using it in bite-sized pop song form, as an avenue for intimate storytelling. But this isn’t to say that the production doesn’t stand out: “Great Guy” turns amapiano’s flagellating bass synths into pure, rumbling texture, while “2:30” lets them resonate in a way that recalls fújì’s talking drums. Closer “Yoga” even turns traditional séga—music that originated from enslaved Africans in Réunion and Mauritius—into a contemporary plea for peace. Asake grew up listening to Nigerian artists who continually evolved the country’s music, like Fela Kuti, Ayinla Omowura, and Wande Coal. His cross-generational, intercontinental music is doing the same."

Perhaps that’s why he’s so drawn to amapiano, a style of music that South African artist Thandiswa Mazwai has said reflects “how radical Black joy can be.” Inevitably, some of the most irresistible songs on Work of Art are cheery. “Sunshine” is an encouraging balm, its bubbly synths and rising vocal harmonies capturing the warmth of time spent with loved ones. “Awodi” is less summery but just as hopeful. Asake sings about rising from the slums, and his slow, patient delivery feels like he’s extending an arm to lift you up beside him.Stories of rebirth are nothing new, but Asake’s feel revelatory because they’re in constant search of innovation. “Amapiano” sheds some light on his approach. If the amapiano coming from South Africa is more tied to the country’s dance lineage, then Asake is intent on using it in bite-sized pop song form, as an avenue for intimate storytelling. But this isn’t to say that the production doesn’t stand out: “Great Guy” turns amapiano’s flagellating bass synths into pure, rumbling texture, while “2:30” lets them resonate in a way that recalls fújì’s talking drums. Closer “Yoga” even turns traditional séga—music that originated from enslaved Africans in Réunion and Mauritius—into a contemporary plea for peace.

The heaviness of solitary dreaming—“Hiding out inside my head”; “I like the thoughts I think…without you”; “Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind”—is paired with comforting grace when reflected through Olsen’s fever-pitched warble and incisive lyrics, her schema of gravity and wonder. Like other artist-philosophers of the human heart before her, Olsen creates a spirit of hard-won knowledge, the feeling of steadiness in a brutal world.Not particularly easy work. But with Big Time—her clearest and most radiant music—Olsen set out to more deliberately foreground the virtue of ease. Having journeyed from folk-rock poet to jukebox rock’n’roller to baroque epicist on her last proper record, 2019’s monumental All Mirrors, she is reborn on Big Time as an alternately smiling or crying cowgirl. Olsen teases out the twang and pedal steel of her longtime country influences, like the audacity of Skeeter Davis and Tammy Wynette, or the blistering ache of Hank Williams. The tough-and-tender extremity of country music has always been present in her yearning cadences, now more lucid than ever, but here she leans further into its in-the-room glow, its honesty and resilience. As her heights magnify, so do her depths.In the months leading to the recording of Big Time, Olsen came out as queer with a new partner. She told her parents, who by chance both passed away within weeks. Big Time absorbs the entangling transformations of grief and new love, their power to clarify, and reprioritize, everything—the album, she said, is the work of a person “irreversibly changed.” The titular concept of Big Time is not just an evocation of its glistening Nashville sound, nor is it only a declaration of overflowing, abiding love, as when Olsen croons “I’m loving you big time/I’m loving you more.” In one time-collapsing swoop, that refrain echoes words of affection Olsen received from her partner as well as from her late mother. All of Big Time is charged by an elevated awareness of the clock’s hands, how they fold in on each other: time Olsen loses track of; time she spends in vain, “to be somebody”; time that physically slows and that quickens to the instant. This is a record about how time billows out from the center of now—forward, backwards, inside and down, like in a science fiction novel.Where Olsen once sang of being a fool in love as if it were uncool, Big Time presents dignity in such a position. On the closer, “Chasing the Sun,” she sends her partner a “postcard” from another room: “I’m just writing to say that I can’t find my clothes/If you’re looking for something to do.” The golden hour title track beams with the quotidian intimacy of Frank O’Hara in a pickup truck: kissing, coffee, nature, sunshine, “talkin’ with your eyes.” A songwriter who formerly wished that she could only buy into all that was promised to her is now a believer, soundtracking the crystalline clarity of feeling connected, at last, to herself and others."

She released four studio albums and one double live, more than matching her output for the previous two decades combined. Drifting away from country music (which had little use for her as a songwriter or as a performer) and toward a gritty strain of roots rock, Williams grew more confessional in her lyrics, which have grown blatantly autobiographical and have coalesced into a larger story built around her romantic ups and downs. Rather than refining her craft, this development has actually had a deleterious effect on her music. In contrast to her first two country-blues albums and her three truly country albums, her four records from the previous decade have been alternately alienating and ingratiating, self-indulgent and self-denying-- eager both to please an audience and disdain them. Her once effortless lyricism has become rigid and workmanlike, with clichéd phrases standing in for complex evocations and words seemingly chosen less for their intrinsic meaning and more for their adherence to her AABB rhyme schemes.Blessed, her ninth studio album, marks the culmination of another trend in Williams' career, one that is much less concrete than the mechanisms of meter and rhyme. Her songwriting has become increasingly about the present rather than the past. Sweet Old World (1992) and Car Wheels on a Gravel Road (1998) possessed a heady notion of personal history, exploring the ways we hold onto old lovers and how certain places (an old juke joint, the town of Pineola, Miss.) can evoke such bittersweet memories. Blessed has only one prominent concrete noun-- in ""Copenhagen"", named for the city where she learns of a friend's death. And why shouldn't Williams be more interested in the here and now instead of the there and then? If her 2000s albums have rendered her life as it happens, then these new songs chronicle a new and unprecedented chapter: happiness and contentment. In 2009, she married her manager Tom Overby, which means she's writing songs about finding her joy and from the perspective of a happy woman. ""Sweet Love"" is a straightforward love song that recalls a time when Williams could make simple sound endlessly complex, and ""Convince Me"" and ""Kiss Like Your Kiss"" (written for True Blood) are her sexiest songs since ""Right in Time"" 13 years ago.Happiness suits her, but Williams' frustrating tics remain-- the constant repetition of phrases, the inflexible song structures, the compartmentalized melodies-- and are matched with anonymous roots rock courtesy of co-producers Overby and Don Was. Williams builds the title track on various iterations of the line ""We were blessed by..."" but the song becomes increasingly hackneyed in its spirituality, speaking in broad platitudes rather than concrete examples. ""We were blessed by the battered woman who didn't seek revenge,"" she sings plaintively, but vaguely. ""We were blessed by the warrior who didn't need to win."" When she tries to reach outside herself and address the wars in the Middle East-- a first for her-- Williams comes up with a great idea that allows her to alternate between the battlefield and the home front, but the persistent couplets deliver only dully acoustic melodrama, culminating in the lines, ""Today I took a bullet through the heart/ Baby's gonna have to make a brand-new start."""

Like so many new artists coming out of the Deep South, the Floridian mostly croons about his pain and inner demons in two-minute ballads featuring Instagram caption-worthy one-liners like “Heart been broke so many times, I don’t know what to believe.”As far as singing rappers go, Rod Wave is much more Kevin Gates, say, Young Thug. Rod grew up on Gates’ tender street rap, and paid tribute to his idol in a recent interview: “You made me understand people like us could actually go far, people like us could actually do it in the game. Just the fact that you could take your pain and turn up with it.” Rod Wave’s Ghetto Gospel is very much in the mold of the Baton Rouge star’s music; Gates even executive-produced it.Like YoungBoy Never Broke Again, JayDaYoungan, and other Southern rappers belting about their struggles, Rod Wave was amassing millions of plays on YouTube even before Kevin Gates’ involvement. The sound of Ghetto Gospel—bloodletting over somber pianos and country guitars—isn’t far off from earlier singles like “Popular Loner” and “Heart 4 Sale.”But his storytelling has a new clarity, and his voice has developed so much range that I’m surprised he hasn’t already recorded an NPR Tiny Desk. The heaviest single on the album is “Close Enough to Hurt,” touching on the PTSD that he’s mentioned on-record before. On “Poison,” he digs deep to tell tales of the terrors that keep him up at night. “Late at night, I been roaming, I ain’t getting no sleep/It’s hard to stay focused when that pain running deep,” he wails.Ghetto Gospel features two Gates collaborations. These moments feel like Gates passing the torch in real time, as Rod Wave howls like he’s stuck in the begging-for-love-in-the-rain era of ’90s R&B: “When I think about my past, that shit give me chills.” Compared with Gates, Rod’s hooks are glossy, but he can also strip his music down, like the drumless, acoustic guitar-heavy “Chip on my Shoulder,” that sounds like his street spin on a country-pop record.Rod is at the forefront of an unofficial subgenre of rap called  “pain music,” and it’s been developing since the days of Boosie and Webbie. Artists working in this vein have also found a way to integrate country and pop sounds into their hip-hop in a way that’s considerably less performative than that song about horses. What’s next is a superstar. Numbers-wise the answer is YoungBoy Never Broke Again, though legal troubles will always hold him back. And Kevin Gates is now a thirty-something that’s sliding into a Gucci Mane-like role. Rod Wave may or may not be that person. If Ghetto Gospel makes anything clear, it’s that nobody sings about their pain like him."

But for the first time, the trio indulges its rock’n’roll instincts, resulting in one of the most powerful albums in the band’s catalog.","Spoiler alerts do not apply to the Necks. For nearly three decades, the instrumental Australian trio has often followed a deceptively simple formula, both in the studio and on stage: Begin in miniature, with discrete thoughts stated patiently with grand piano, upright bass, and spare drums. Over the course of an hour or so, ratchet up the intensity and density of those phrases, expanding and interlocking them until they suggest much more than those primitive elements—perhaps a symphony, sustaining a crescendo as if holding a collective breath, or a large free-jazz ensemble, locked inside an unexpected moment of improvisational communion. There are, of course, exceptions. Sometimes they update their palette, adding a guitar here, an organ there; sometimes they invert the mold, so a monolithic sound breaks down rather than building up. But listening to the best of the Necks’ 20 albums can feel like watching a favorite movie for the 10th time; you get the plot and have even memorized some of its tricks, but changes in your own perspective let you see it anew, to discover a new thread inside a pattern you thought you knew.That said, spoiler alert: Almost halfway into Body, the trio’s engrossing and overwhelming 20th album, the Necks shoot from a slumber of pensive bass and piano into a clanging post-rock eruption, where walloped drums swing hard and heavy beneath pounded keys and shrieking electric guitar that washes everything in vivid neon streaks. The first time you hear it, you may jolt upright with surprise, as if a boogeyman has suddenly appeared from around a corner in that movie you thought you knew so well. But this is not a blip. For a quarter-hour, the Necks grind away at this theme, rending a basic rock’n’roll riff and rhythm into utter dust.Tony Buck, who tortures his drums and tames the electric guitar here, is the anchor and the aggressor. But it’s Chris Abrahams, ducking behind the cover of Buck and bassist Lloyd Swanton, who dances inside the din with boogie-woogie piano lines. Like funhouse mirrors, his harmonies reflect and reshape foundational rock chords, offering flickers of light from inside the storm. The unexpected stretch matches the delirious heights of the reborn version of Swans, when Michael Gira’s big band would lash out at a melody for half an hour, or the dizzying swirl of Rhys Chatham’s Guitar Trio, where one chord played over and over against a swinging beat somehow produces a trance. This is ecstatic music, as engrossing and powerful as anything the Necks have ever made."

In the data-dump era, where artists churn out as much music as they can, he makes two songs in the time it might take others to make 20. He is careful and meticulous, malleable and introspective.  His sound totters between drill and pop, sometimes hard, sometimes smooth. Eventually, he blurs the lines between them.All of this is on full display on his brutal, powerful debut, Die a Legend. The title sounds like an epic fate, the kind that befalls a mythical hero. But for Polo G, it’s more of a cautionary tale. In his estimation, there’s no praise until you’re gone, and by then, it’s too late. He wants to leave a legacy, but he also knows you have to survive long enough to create one. The album art features photos of eight people in the clouds, like the ones you see tacked onto posterboards at funerals. Die a Legend honors their stories, their memories, their legends, with a painstaking account of the kind of violence that cost them their lives. It is one of the finest rap debuts of the year.What draws you even closer to Polo G is the heartfelt essence of his raps. He can dive into the nooks and crannies of his life story or take an eagle-eye perspective, but he does both with a hypnotic, penetrating conviction. His songs are deeply meditative, and, in turn, revealing. “My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don’t get no sleep,” he raps. It’s that penchant for overthinking that’s led him to anatomize his own pain so carefully and so potently. His verses are so smooth and vivid it’s like you are a breath away from him at all times.Polo G allows his songs to be jointless. With hardly another guest on this album (save for Lil Tjay on the sullen party hit “Pop Out”), his hooks feed directly into verses, like a snake swallowing its tail. They are simple but well-rendered, each distinctive but of a kind. Sometimes he’ll rap an entire verse in the same rhyme scheme (“Last Strike”), something he likely picked up listening to Gucci Mane. Maintaining the same end rhyme throughout sounds less involved than untangling knotty wordplay, and many purists see doing so as less complex. But it takes a talented rapper to ride out a single current for an entire 16 bars, especially when each of its lines runs right into the next, as on “A King’s Nightmare”: “Spittin’ verses, I’m desperate, I need a mansion and a coupe/You done signed over your life and now you slavin’ in the booth/Now we hang ourself with chains, they used to make us rock a noose/Shorties hoppin’ off the porch ’cause it ain’t shit else to do.” That’s the difference between a wave-rider and a wave-maker."

Now, he’s got the weight of YSL’s RICO case on his shoulders. Since he was released from jail in December, the generally tiresome social media conversation—driven by salacious Instagram and YouTube rags, plus a few rappers looking for attention—has focused on whether he “snitched.” But Gunna’s priority isn’t really responding to internet jokes. Instead, on his new album a Gift & a Curse, he’s trying to describe the emotional strain of a case that has torn apart brotherhoods and changed his outlook on life. He’s also attempting to keep the fun and lighthearted spirit of his prior music. The result is an album that is too vague to have much depth and too absorbed in real-life drama to have the feel-good vibes he wants to preserve.Lead single “Bread & Butter” sets the tone, balancing anger at friends who have turned their back on him with wistfulness for the old days when none of this was on his mind. It’s the kind of confessional, melodic pain rap that is popular in the Deep South, but the AutoTune-heavy singing is too monotone and polished for it to be effective; listen to how a crooner like Tampa’s T9ine lilts to make up for not having a big voice. Gunna could also attempt lyrical vulnerability, emulating the blunt poetics of an artist like Jacksonville’s Lil Poppa. But he is mostly still caught up trying to puff out his chest.I get it. He rose to the top of the Atlanta hip-hop ranks by being cool; it’s hard to dig in when he’s never really had to. Still, it’s frustrating when you can tell that he’s not being entirely real with you. Such is the case on the overly guarded and painfully slow “Paybach,” where he alludes to friends accusing him of betraying Young Thug by taking the Alford plea: “Switching on my brother are you serious?” he coos. I can assume that he’s wounded and confused by that accusation—but I have to assume, because instead of letting us in, he follows up with the flex “Nigga ain’t gon’ touch me and that’s period.” Similarly, “Idk Nomore” avoids all feelings with threats and hollow platitudes. At one point he sings, “Wanna know how Wunna feel? then listen to my music”—as if that isn’t what we are doing.He’s better off on songs like “Fukumean,” where he goes back-to-the-basics—smoking good weed, thinking about boobs—deploying the explosive, run-on flow he nailed down around Drip Harder. Or on “Ca$h $hit,” where he continues to be nondescript emotionally but exhibits some imagination in the countless ways he describes getting fits off: “I drip like sweat in the sauna” and “Pop out, when I drip it’s a puddle.” The breezy beat of “Ca$h $hit,” with its low-key woodwinds whirling in the background, is one of the rare instrumentals that has any life to it. Notably, both of these songs come in the middle of the 15-track album, smashed in between lots of seriousness. They’ll be solid singles, but here, they really tear you from the moment.Gunna is yet another rap star struggling with the expectation that if you hit a low point, you have to be prepared to let it all out by the next annual release date. Of all the tracks on a Gift & a Curse, “Rodeo Dr” feels truest to where he’s at right now. The beat is brisk, the flows switch, and luxury goods are still in sight but he airs some frustration: “Fuck this shit, you know I’m still doing it for Jeff and Lil Keed,” he raps, and that “Fuck this shit” is more moving than any part where being moving is the point. Clearly, Gunna isn’t ready or willing to fully pull at his emotions. I’d rather hear the album he wants to make over the one he feels like he’s supposed to. Maybe now that he’s gotten a Gift & a Curse out of the way, he’ll feel free."

He writes like someone keeping his head above water, hustling paycheck to paycheck, with dwindling hopes that a career in music will provide all promised riches.Durk Banks knows what it’s like to brush with rap superstardom. A prominent player in the early-2010s Chicago drill surge, he leveraged interest in the scene to cut a deal with Def Jam. But Durk never seemed comfortable breaking bread with the majors, and has since retreated into the cold embrace of his hometown. Last year’s Signed to the Streets 3 was released in partnership with Interscope, representing another—perhaps final—throw of the dice in Durk’s pursuit of mainstream acceptance. But the album just kind of came and went, and so he returns with Love Songs 4 the Streets 2, a follow up to a 2017 tape that offered hymns for the Chicago neighborhoods he’ll forever orbit, and an antidote to some of his label struggles.At its best, Love Songs 4 the Streets 2 evokes similar sentiments. “I thought my life was supposed to change when I got that deal,” Durk sighs on “Rebellious” as he details the need to pay his grandmother’s bills and mourns fallen cousins. Assertions like “even though I’m still rich” feel perfunctory, with Durk’s half-sung, Auto-Tune-doused croons deflating like a punctured basketball. On “Locked Up,” he appears to talk directly to a jailed friend about the thoughtlessness and pain that led the pair to this point in their lives—a song that hits just weeks after it was revealed that a Georgia judge has found probable cause to charge Banks, as well as fellow rapper King Von, with criminal attempt to commit murder. There’s no American Dream success story here. Durk makes being a rapper sound like a hard slog.At a full seven songs longer than its preceding volume, Love Songs 4 the Streets 2 has time to run the full gamut of Durk’s styles. “Green Light” is a hardboiled trap thriller; “Die Slow” slides into guest 21 Savage’s haunted lane. As if to underline Durk’s mainstream struggles, cracks appear on the tracks ostensibly cut for radio appeal. The Durk-Meek Mill team-up “Bougie” lacks chemistry. Sleazy sex jam “Extravagant” comes close, but it’s held back by Nicki Minaj’s ill-suited bombastic verse and a few laughable Durk one-liners.Culling these missteps would have helped the tape’s batting average, but they can’t mask Durk’s undeniable strengths. Looking back on drill, nobody really cashed in on the promised riches. Very young stars had the keys to the kingdom but couldn’t find their way through the gates. But in the case of Lil Durk, something special happened: He kept making great music, evolving out of a hard-boiled subgenre towards something more meditative and essential."

ROSALÍA & Lil Baby) - REMIX,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0567,modern,5.9,The newly minted rap superstar’s obligatory label compilation is more merch bundle than album.,"In 2018, Travis Scott became a bonafide rap superstar, reaching a plateau where the only way to prove how high you’ve reached is to bring other guys up there, too. And so here comes his obligatory label compilation, a signal boost for his signees designed to be a flex in and of itself. Only problem is: He doesn’t have much of a crew. The only people in Scott’s orbit are the three rappers signed to his Cactus Jack imprint: Don Toliver, Luxury Tax 50, and Sheck Wes (in a joint deal with GOOD Music). As roster compilations go, this seven-track sampler spread what few assets it has too thin and hardly makes for a showcase.JACKBOYS has been pegged as a “debut album” for the titular crew, but that is clearly an overstatement. There are two Don Toliver songs and one Sheck Wes song. There is one Luxury Tax 50 verse. Travis Scott fills out the tracklist with a 50-second instrumental and a remix to his recent hit single, “Highest in the Room,” with Rosalía and Lil Baby. JACKBOYS is a branding opportunity, pure and simple: From the Harmony Korine cover art to the promotional film shot as if A24 produced a Need For Speed sequel, it all seems like empty influencer bait. This is music as part of a merch bundle, about as necessary as a branded fire extinguisher.With ASTROWORLD, Travis Scott finally earned the maestro mantle he was so eager to bestow upon himself, but that curator’s touch is missing here. Pop Smoke is in his element over AXL’s drill production on “Gatti,” pushing Travis into the margins. The song sounds like diet “Welcome to the Party,” and drill isn’t the kind of subgenre where you’re looking to cut calories. “Out West” finds Young Thug carrying Travis (for the umpteenth time), and in this case Thug is barely even trying. Don Toliver’s “Had Enough” is his song in name only; with Quavo and Offset on hand, it sounds like another Migos demo for the Carters’ album with its blatant “Summer” sample and blank, reference-track vocal takes. The sole JACKBOYS posse cut, “Gang Gang,” is all over the place, squandering WondaGurl production.If anyone comes off like they didn’t waste their time making this, it’s Don Toliver, who goes full tilt even working in the periphery of other people’s songs. His breakthrough on ASTROWORLD’s “Can’t Say” outlined his promise; his was such a distinct performance among an all-star cast that it left listeners scrambling to identify him on the creditless tracklist. He doesn’t squander any of that goodwill here, coming off as a budding talent even as the album grows more and more forgettable. (He scored his first TikTok hit with “No Idea” late last year.) Toliver is like the T-1000 model of Travis Scott: he uses Auto-Tune to similar effect, but he works in a higher octave range than Scott and is simply a more lifelike upgrade of his prototype. This is best expressed on “What to Do?”, a duet with Scott in which they both try to put the pieces of a drunken night back together. It’s Toliver who sounds like he’s rallying, his voice less like a piece of software and more an instrument of feeling. His singsong verse is one of the few moments on JACKBOYS that isn’t just product."
2H0w7oYDjUvgsFlNQ5swIg,0.767,115.957,0.825,arabic,-7.893,0.0914,0.857,Asake,4.0,0.0418,61,work of art,Arab X,Basquiat,4.6e-06,1.0,5.0,0.547,modern,8.0,"The Nigerian singer-songwriter’s second album is in constant search of innovation, fusing traditional and contemporary African music into a celebration of success and community.","Asake’s on top of the world right now and isn’t coming down. On “Olorun,” the meditative opener to his second album, Work of Art, he extols the Supreme Being of the Yoruba religion before praising himself. “I’m a brand new man,” he proclaims. Ahmed Ololade’s first love was dancing, but as much as he loved feeling the music, he knew the best way to make money was to become a consummate artist. He took up singing and adopted a stage name, and after a steady stream of singles he released his first full-length, Mr. Money With the Vibe, in 2022. It became Billboard’s highest-charting debut album from a Nigerian artist. He was, undoubtedly, a star.Asake’s first album was the culmination of ideas percolating throughout his home country. Most notably, it was amapiano—a strain of South African house music in the lineage of kwaito—that brought Asake’s Afrofusion music to another level. This regional style was already spreading across the continent—in Tanzania and Kenya, Namibia and Mozambique—and fellow Nigerians like Davido and Mayorkun were collaborating with South Africans to meld it with Afrobeats. What separated Asake from his peers was how he forged a sound all his own: He incorporated choral harmonies and string arrangements, and worked in elements of the Indigenous Yoruba music known as fújì. The opening track on his debut announced this audacious blend: “Dull” interpolated “Oke Agba” from the pioneering fújì musician Ayinde Barrister.With Work of Art, Asake understands that his winning formula needs no adjustments. Wistful strings inject solemnity on “What’s Up My G,” and as the characteristic log-drum loop of amapiano establishes a lithe beat, he expertly switches between vocal rhythms and inflections. There are many shades to his wealth, his nimble delivery implies. And when he lists off designer brands and luxury cars, the host of voices behind him frame his braggadocio as a spiritual act. “If you don’t feel blessed, you won’t be blessed,” he recently told ABC News. It sounds like the flipside to a Yoruba òwe, or proverb: “Ẹní lówó kó ṣe bí ọba” (“Whoever has riches should act like a king”).These two pithy statements reflect Asake’s own mindset of manifestation: His songs often read as a proposition that anyone who hustles can experience the blessings he’s had. On “Basquiat,” he makes sure to let you know that the “work of art” his album title refers to is, indeed, himself. Still, the song’s group chants remind you that celebration can and should be a communal act. Perhaps that’s why he’s so drawn to amapiano, a style of music that South African artist Thandiswa Mazwai has said reflects “how radical Black joy can be.” Inevitably, some of the most irresistible songs on Work of Art are cheery. “Sunshine” is an encouraging balm, its bubbly synths and rising vocal harmonies capturing the warmth of time spent with loved ones. “Awodi” is less summery but just as hopeful. Asake sings about rising from the slums, and his slow, patient delivery feels like he’s extending an arm to lift you up beside him.Stories of rebirth are nothing new, but Asake’s feel revelatory because they’re in constant search of innovation. “Amapiano” sheds some light on his approach. If the amapiano coming from South Africa is more tied to the country’s dance lineage, then Asake is intent on using it in bite-sized pop song form, as an avenue for intimate storytelling. But this isn’t to say that the production doesn’t stand out: “Great Guy” turns amapiano’s flagellating bass synths into pure, rumbling texture, while “2:30” lets them resonate in a way that recalls fújì’s talking drums. Closer “Yoga” even turns traditional séga—music that originated from enslaved Africans in Réunion and Mauritius—into a contemporary plea for peace. Asake grew up listening to Nigerian artists who continually evolved the country’s music, like Fela Kuti, Ayinla Omowura, and Wande Coal. His cross-generational, intercontinental music is doing the same."

Depending on your mood, it will either stir idyllic childhood memories or set your teeth on edge. YATTA excels at inspiring these kinds of polarizing emotions on WAHALA, whose title translates from Krio into “a state of worry, trouble, a terrible mess."" Short lines of improvised poetry and fragmented phrases are manipulated with a loop pedal and sent swimming across the ambient backing tracks. Over all of this, YATTA grapples with depression, anxiety, and identity, and ultimately tries to convince themselves of the near-impossible—to just buck up and be happy. When the album ends after 30 minutes, it’s like you’ve been listening to the therapy session going on inside someone else’s head. The experience is both harrowing and strangely cleansing.WAHALA is dominated by YATTA’s voice—or, rather, YATTA’s voices. Armed with a toy box of digital tricks, their vocals are pitched up or down to represent various parts of their personality competing for space in the same psyche. Deeper, distorted tones represent the dark side; a child-like lilt hints at optimism. Loops and glitches applied to these words become part of the project’s metronome: On opener “A Lie”—which begins with the advice “Hey, don't let yourself ruin/Run the show!”—the latter part of the word “survive” is repeatedly triggered to conjure a sense of rhythm.This experimental production gives WAHALA an undulating texture that’s complemented by YATTA’s own fluid voice. On “Cowboys,” which adds wavering guitar to the hazy mix, YATTA sings “Cowboys are black/And techno is too,” and layers the sentiment with a demonic, guttural voice proclaiming “Artsy black girls are like Pokemon/Gotta catch ‘em all.” These juxtaposed fragments land like slogans from an unearthed Basquiat painting—they’re a cue for your mind to wander off into the imagery.A quote from YATTA accompanying WAHALA explains that the album is inspired by “being black, being trans, and being African on foreign land,” along with psychosis and depression, rage and pain, tension and confusion, and the cyclical nature of these intermingling factors. But the music and the message don’t play out in a tidy linear unpacking; these facets cannot be dealt with one at a time under the auspice of the increasingly commercialized concept of self-care. The soul of WAHALA is about accepting that all these different feelings can be felt at once. YATTA inches towards this realization on the album’s concluding song, “Underwater, Now.” Set to a soothing, submerged choral backdrop, YATTA throws off the processing effects and speaks in their natural voice, expressing something we can all relate to: “All I know is that it all fucking hurts.”"

Georgian Liz Durrett was not that kind of teenager. Sounding like a drowsier Chan Marshall, Durrett's quaint, folksy ghost stories seem far more mature than typical young pup fare-- it's difficult to imagine she was around the same age as Avril and Ashlee when she recorded Husk.Then again, most teenagers don't have Vic Chesnutt for a crazy uncle and guiding influence. Produced by the beloved paraplegic southern songwriter, this charmingly backwoods nine-song debut sees the now twentysomething Durrett airing out her spooky mid-90s adolescent material in preparation for an album of more current songs due later this year.Husk is an odd family affair, to say the least. Think Partridge Family but uglier, death-obsessed, and with a sunburnt, junkyard car in place of the fruity schoolbus. Chesnutt, his wife, and Durrett's grandmother all contribute, with Vic steering the album's sparse arrangements and sometimes overbearing funeral-waltz mood. Unfortunately, Durrett's abstract, oddly spiritual lyrical tendencies are a far howl from her uncle's singularly witty narratives. ""There's the ghost of a beast in the woods,"" she sings in a peculiarly calm drawl on the title track, and much of the album features disconnected permutations on such vaguely haunting imagery and little more. The undeveloped facets of Durrett's nascent songwriting skills are often masked by her warm, natural vocals and her uncle's comfy-wooden-chair production but, with too few melodic or lyrical anchors, much of the deathly mystery surrounding Husk quickly evaporates into a hazy, nondescript mist typified by one-word song titles such as ""Slip"", ""Vine"", and ""Net"".Many songs drag and sway without leaving an impression; they fall into some kind of endless folk singer-songwriter purgatory. Even with its nightmarish, echoed-vibrato back-ups, ""Bc"" comes across as a boring, second-rate haunted hay ride. ""Net"" veers dangerously close to Lilith Fair banal acoustic balladry and is barely salvaged by Chesnutt's reliably minimal, resonant recording techniques.It's when Durrett focuses her songwriting that she becomes scarily good, as on the Silence of the Lambs-style murky kidnapping tale ""Captive"". Old-tyme record player pops add to the harrowing theatrics as the deceptively placid singer emotes from a rusty, dripping basement, ""I sit in this corner with my hands bound and my eyes closed."" The juxtaposition of Durrett's assured delivery and the song's prickly subject matter sends uncanny chills.As an introduction to a young talent, Husk shows promise but this early-years compilation doesn't quite hold together as an album on its own. Still, tracks like the relatively upbeat ""Lull"", ""Captive"", and the slow-burning ""Husk"" provide compelling evidence that Durrett should be entered in the next-Cat Power sweepstakes."

On his new album, he recruits an all-star cast including Beck, Little Dragon, Vince Staples, and more.","The universe opened quickly for Flume, the 24-year-old Australian DJ/producer born Harley Edward Streten: his debut album topped the ARIA charts, Lorde and Disclosure enlisted him for remixes, and mud-caked crowds have strained to glimpse him at Coachella and Lollapalooza. And with that rise, he’s become something of a dance music Rorschach test: either he’s posited as mainstream electropop’s next great hope, or he deepens the frowns of those fatigued by rave culture ubiquity and personifies all that is frivolous about it. (The Guardian recently brushed him aside with, “Oh, great! Just what the world has been waiting for,” a pessimism that leans toward the Woody Allen school of astronomy.) It’s no wonder, on his second album, Flume says he aimed to write a track that sounds “like the fabric of the universe tearing ”—all that weight was cramping his shoulders.Skin, the record in question, aims for that level of grandiosity throughout. It’s a stadium-sized upsell of Flume’s prior atmospheric formula—skittish beats that cleave easily to gruff rappers and R&B sopranos alike, rattling future-bass warp, undulating synths—that swells with energy but spills over edges. Here, Flume recruits an array of famous guests (Beck, Little Dragon, Vince Staples, Raekwon, AlunaGeorge), padding their radio-friendly cuts with the persistent crescendos of his self-titled debut, then ballasting them with loose instrumental interludes. The sum suggests that he’s an earnest collaborator, flashier but still casting around for a distinct identity.Flume has a fondness for female voices singing in their upper register. On his first album, that role was played by Jezzabell Doran on the album’s best cut (“Sleepless”). Here, it’s handled twofold by Aluna Francis of AlunaGeorge (the groggy, glitchy “Innocence”) and also Kučka, a young Aussie singer who distinctly echoes Francis in slinky R&B phrasing and tinny topnotes. The halting, futurist beat of Kučka’s solo track (“Numb & Getting Colder”) nods to Flying Lotus and Four Tet; that core is closely repeated on her second turn, “Smoke & Retribution,” which jolts awake in agile verses by rapper Vince Staples. The lead single, “Never Be Like You,” is already a Disclosure-remixed pop hit (and a winking psychotropic video); it saunters on Flume’s languid trap drops and a plummy R&B hook from the Canadian singer Kai, a former Jack Ü collaborator who trills a mundane mea culpa with a gleam of defiance. (“I’m only human can’t you see/I made, I made a mistake/Please just look me in my face/Tell me everything’s OK”). There’s a mathematical quality to how he deploys singers in these productions, where the heavier his low-end distortion throbs, the more featherweight smoke curls follow."

The final track, “Dedicated,” is pure middle-aged ennui couched in wistful pop-culture references, the sort of preoccupied nostalgia trip Jay-Z perfected on 4:44. Nas name-drops Mike Tyson, Kimora Lee, and Carlito’s Way, alluding to some compelling ideas without really exploring them; it’s breezy enough that you can almost forgive the kids-these-days grumbling. But the chorus—“I dedicated my life, my life,” a simple repetition of an evasive half-statement—is tantalizing in its elision. At 48, the Queens native continues to enjoy the institutional acclaim afforded one of rap’s most prodigious talents. A survey of his latter-day catalog yields a melange of short-lived crossovers and self-indulgent concept records, the cynical musings of the bitterly divorced. To what did you dedicate your life, Nas?Magic points to hard-earned craftsmanship, the humble cultivation of a blue-collar métier. It asks that you overlook his mid-career miscues and late-career misanthropy, which is just as well—his listeners have long clamored for a return to ’90s pragmatism, and Magic is the most meat-and-potatoes Nas record in years. “Speechless” casts back to the It Was Written aesthetic, with a spoken intro and pealing mandolin instrumental. A flashy performance with a modest purview, it relays a judicious street code (“I’m tellin’ it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence/When you run in a n***a’s crib, n***a, you better be ready to sit”) with knowing winks at the fourth wall (“Only thing undefeated is time/The second is the internet, number three is this rhyme”). If it’s fan service, it’s the best Nas song in a decade.The album maintains a sprightly 95 bpm clip, opportune for its focus on verbal acrobatics over Nas’s usual sermonizing. Anything faster is liable to trip him up; anything slower and he’s practically comatose. Unsurprisingly, these songs are far more habitable than the haranguing fare of 2018’s Nasir and 2020’s King’s Disease. Similar to 2004’s “Good Morning,” “Ugly” flips an atmospheric premise (“It’s ugly outside, it’s muggy, it’s money outside/One hundred and five Fahrenheit, thunderous skies”) into a metaphor for societal rot, a tactile slice of life relative to his familiar, narrative-driven methods. “The Truth” packs battle rhymes with bright imagery: “Galactica glaciers, eighty-eight karats, immaculate paystubs/Them n****s do a crime, I drop a rhyme, it’s the same rush.” Nas is a pointillist, better at writing couplets than albums, and Magic proves he’s still a transcendent rapper when he allows himself to be."

He doesn't have the cachet that Bob Dylan has, yet he's much more approachable-- populist in practice, not just in theory. He has inspired pale imitators (Tom Petty, John Mellencamp), but has no peers to speak of. Unlike similar 1980s supercelebrities Prince or Madonna, he remains artistically viable and culturally relevant two decades after the height of his popularity. In the 1970s, he was never hip, but in the 2000s he has gained a considerable following among indie rock bands like the Hold Steady, the Killers, and the National, among many others. Because his music has lost none of its triumphant rock'n'roll kick-- no matter how many times you hear it, ""Born to Run"" always kills-- he has become today what Brian Wilson was 10 years ago: the indie ideal.And yet, his popularity extends far beyond the indie realm. His mainstream audience remains fanatically loyal, making him one of the few artists that both you and your boss enjoy. Springsteen's success continues despite the constantly shifting ground that finds him on one side of certain cultural and political lines, then on another. His 2002 album The Rising was received as a post-9/11 salve, a paean to American resilience in the face of tragedy: The same people who died or lost loved ones in the attacks-- cops, firefighters, corporate grunts, their wives, husbands, families-- were said to be the very same people who inhabited Springsteen's earlier songs, now facing hard, cold reality. So it's forgivable if many heard the album they believed the country needed instead of the one Springsteen actually made.Despite the nickname, the Boss has never inhabited his iconic status comfortably. Devils & Dust followed The Rising in 2005*,* trading the E Street Band's full sound for acoustic contemplation and spinning a much grimmer version of America that was full of unrealized dreams and insoluble injustices. We Shall Overcome, his album of Pete Seeger covers and his best late-career album, proved much subtler in its subversiveness, communicating an anti-establishment stance through decades-old tunes. That's nothing new for him: The E Street Band's enormous, exuberant rock'n'roll has always hidden darker currents of American realism, most famously on ""Born in the U.S.A."", a song about disillusioned Vietnam vets that was hilariously co-opted by Ronald Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign as a theme song.That's the secret power of Magic, Springsteen's 15th album in 34 years: The album hides its raw disillusionment deep within the music, mingling it with a weary optimism and a thoroughly committed lustiness that have not diminished with age. The result is a surprisingly complex album that recalls The River in its heartfelt populism, Darkness on the Edge of Town in its small-town scope, and Tunnel of Love in its mature take on love and sex. On ""I'll Work for Your Love"", which could be a cover of an outtake from the first half of The River, he tells a woman he's ""counting the bones in your back like the stations of the cross""-- a concise fusion of the sexual and the spiritual. Where he once chronicled youthful abandon in the face of life's possibility, now his subject is the wonders of middle-aged contentment, as if he can't believe his own luck. It's a surprisingly durable subject, one that fits his outsize sound perfectly."

Since his alt R&B group Abhi//Dijon split amicably in the mid 2010s, he’s become a wanderer, his music accreting and discarding styles like a subletter acclimating to new quarters. In the past two years, he’s released a smoldering cover of Chaka Khan’s “Sweet Thing,” recorded a Prince pastiche in which he shouts out “Automatic,” and assembled Raveena, John C. Reilly, and Dan Reeder for what can only be described as a folk cypher. The latter song was purposefully eclectic, the guest list decided—in a strange echo of Pitchfork contributor Claire Lobenfeld’s review of Dijon’s 2020 EP—by throwing names into a hat. Dijon has never cast these ventures as ironic, kitschy, or audacious, but they could feel like diversions, gimmicks obscuring the anonymity of his songwriting. Absolutely, his debut album, moves more deliberately, his zigzagging purposeful.Dijon’s pliant, raspy voice guides the record, shifting from coos to wails to murmurs as he sings of love and its complications over folk and soul arrangements. He tends to shun gloss and polish, instead crooning with no discernible enhancements or processing. Accordingly, even his prettiest notes sound physical and textured, like he’s fighting a cold. That strain defines “Many Times,” the powerhouse single about a breaking point in a relationship. “Strawberry, raspberry/Candlelight, satellite/Television, X-ray vision/Aw, what’s it gonna take for you to listen?,” he sings with frustration. His delivery quickens as he rattles off the items of the strange list, the syllables and rhymes running together, growing sillier.For “The Dress,” a slow jam about a couple revisiting their glory days, Dijon turns pleading, drawing out his melodies. “We should go out/And dance like we used to dance/We should go out/And hold hands,” he sings. The character knows the spark has died but prefers to dream, a common choice in these tales of heartbreak. “Annie” is even rosier, Dijon’s narrator glumly telling Annie she can “change [her] mind.” There’s little outright storytelling on the album, but Dijon’s impassioned performances make the elisions feel loaded. Grievances lurk in every omission.The production follows Dijon’s contortions, flickering and flaring in tandem with his theatrics. He recorded Absolutely with a revolving door of collaborators who he encouraged to show up at their leisure, an atmosphere captured in the compositions. Sometimes, Dijon is alone. On the self-produced “Did You See It?,” he floats in a drumless void of plucks as he wonders aloud whether the drugs have kicked in. Other times, the room is packed. “Big Mike’s” swells with instruments—slide guitar, organ, percussion, clarinet, piano—that accent Dijon’s yearning vocals. The singer on “Noah’s Highlight Reel” is just some guy. “He’s a great friend of mine, but also a real country boy—I couldn’t approximate that,” Dijon told NME. Compared to the calculated syncretism of his past music, the direction here is whimsical and open."

Like a noise musician pushing power electronics into the red, Monks is an emotionally blown-out singer, and in her tattered voice she cracks, soars, gnarls, growls, drawls, slurs, rasps. Pain radiates through her and into the band’s songs, like the glow of burning charcoal.Heaven is the quartet’s thrilling second album, and while Dilly Dally might still formally recall 1990s alt-rock à la Hole and the Smashing Pumpkins, their songs are noisier, more metallic, deconstructed. Monks’ raw rapture sets the comparisons at some remove. With her unwavering pop sense and keen way with a chorus, you can tell she is a woman who learned guitar through a Beatles songbook. Dilly Dally once covered Drake’s “Know Yourself” to delightfully grotesque effect, and as their fellow 6 dweller has posited: It’s not about who did it first. It’s about who did it right.Dilly Dally wrote Heaven amid a period of intra-band tumult, and even as the album breathes deeply, its best songs betray those struggles. Heaven riffs on themes of power and sex, of confidence and self-care. But self-care is not soft on Heaven; it’s shrill, life or death, a leaden riff. These complex songs exhibit the care as well as the bleak cause that necessitated it. The roiling early highlight “Doom” swings from hushed dream-pop singing to dread-laden, industrial metal; the lyrics spin ominous uncertainty into New Age affirmations. “Remember who you are/And where you’re gonna be/What’s inside you/Is sacred,” Monks sings, contorting the last word into a guttural growl. On “Sober Motel,” Dilly Dally capture the overwhelming, nearly transcendent clarity that sobriety can beget. “When I’m sober/My soul comes screechin’,” Monks hollers, riding along the final careening syllables as if they were the last roller coaster on Earth.“Sober Motel” feels of a piece with “Marijuana,” a song whose vividness tears you apart. As Monks sings sublimely of “angels” who “got ripped and torn apart inside of me,” heaven is clearly a joint: This is a woman’s impassioned love song to weed and its anxiety-quelling properties. “Couldn’t believe/What I see,” Monks sings on the ecstatic chorus, just before it crashes. “Couldn’t believe/Nothing but what’s inside.” As the song breaks down gloriously, “Marijuana” adopts a destabilizing feeling that is patently gorgeous, as if attuned to a deeper sensitivity of sound. Monks has said, “If the band died and went to heaven, this is the album we would make,” and “Marijuana” is indeed its most heavenly moment.Monks penned “Sober Motel” as a “celebration of sobriety,” she wrote in a statement, “in the midst of an industry that is anything but.” Her hope was that its lyrics would become a mantra of mindfulness for the group, whose members have struggled with alcohol on the road, and “create a sort of protective layer around the band” at every show. Much of Heaven feels restorative in that way. But with “Sober Motel” especially, Dilly Dally subtly chip back at the ways music is exploited under capitalism. Its greatest element, as ever, is Monks’ rare voice—jagged, on fire, intoxicating itself."

It was always a bit uncanny that Mobius Band were on Ghostly International, home of the glimmering D.C. maestro Outputmessage and a dozen or so other electronic mavens. But the group's second full-length album, Heaven, which Ghostly has co-released with Misra, affirms what an odd match-up this is. The title track of 2005's debut, The Loving Sounds of Static, was more up to speed with the current configuration of this trio; its chugging guitars, steady bass tap, and slightly airy, elongated vocals that suggested the French Kicks, poor victims of an artish rock scene hovering around New York City back in 2003-ish. But this second release is even bubblier and more straight-laced than its forebear, or anything the French Kicks have ever done.The only reason the opener ""Hallie"" sounds interesting is because its engaging little synth twinkles are predictable; this grates after a handful of listens. And then you have Ben Sterling and Noam Schatz tossing in some powerpuff drums and a plagiarized Modest Mouse lick, making for a song that meanders too much, yet not at all. A slice of a pleasant moment is spliced too quickly to be memorable; listen to the song a few times and it will get memorably boring.It's reasonable to call this album a sequel to Wincing the Night Away; it is as playful, as wintry, as powder-caked, and minutely epic as the Shins' third effort-- and would also fit right in with it rhythmically, melodically, and I suppose philosophically. ""A Hint of Blood"" has a rust-tinged, backlit guitar dancing stupidly around a major scale; when I say stupidly I mean to say it's trying to be inventive but isn't. Similarly, ""Leave the Keys in the Door"" does a thing that's typical on this album, halting and grinding forth the rhythm. The problem is that the tonal contrasts-- ragged and rough; sleek and dripping-- are cool in theory, but the melodies and ideas being fronted aren't strong enough to sustain them. Lyrically, there are too many similes, emaciated metaphors, and boring choruses like, ""I don't need no/ Friends like these, no"" (""Friends Like These). Elsewhere, they create a domestic scenario around a ""paint"" metaphor and decorate the Tom Petty-like chorus with whining, trumpet-like digital synth washes.On ""Under Sand"", slippery croons seesaw in fifths around the same exact drum rhythm as practically every other song on the album, and the only pretty moment is the brief, glorious vocal soar by Peter Sax in the final moments of the chorus. But it dies down far too quickly. Back to the boring fifth seesaw-- ooh, a key change!-- and déjà vu drums. Cool cover art, though."

From the Fender-aping crunch of Justice's hyper-compressed chords to the noodly, scale-running arpeggios that have fast become Daft Punk's stock-in-trade, the traditional, most populist idea of rock has enjoyed a keening resurgence courtesy the unlikeliest source: the DJ. The ultimate answer to the question of whether that synergy works in both directions-- which is to say, whether dance music functions as well as a seasoning within a predominantly rock sensibility-- is still up for grabs, but as albums like this remind us, the truth is: uh, probably not.Midnight Juggernauts are a three-piece from Melbourne, who, like the New Deal before them, are all about merging the musicianship and bombast of arena rock with the textures and physicality of dance. And while, after Justice and Kanye and T.I., it makes a strange kind of logic that the next iteration of French house in the mainstream should be by the hand of some dilettantish rock band, Dystopia inadvertently points to the practical hurdles to such a union. These are mostly producerly concerns: since French house is powered by massive sonic shifts like EQ sweeps and filters, it commands, by definition, a pretty massive chunk of the frequency spectrum on its own; and so, any attempts to harness that sound into functioning like just another instrument in a rock band are going to leave you with something that either sounds comically overstuffed or sadly tokenish.It's a problem you can hear the trio grappling with over the course of the record. One of their favorite workarounds is to use instruments for the verses and have their burlier electronic arrangements take over for the choruses, but this constant baton-passing quickly starts to wear. The irony is that when they're not worrying so much about how or where to fit all their instruments into the mix, they sound more comfortable; between the juddering chorus to ""Ending of an Era"", the Gallic throwback of ""Road to Recovery"", and the rolling synth bassline in album highlight ""Shadows"", there's enough here to suggest they'd actually be better served by ditching their stubborn insistence on live material outright.The kicker is that, without their live/electronic shtick to distinguish them, Midnight Juggernauts don't seem to be anything other than gifted mimics. As great as it is, ""Road to Recovery"" is de Homem-Christo & Bangalter with proggy lyrics, the awful ""Tombstone"" is a completely shameless Ratatat rip, and the title track, with its dreamy acoustic guitars, synth clouds, and hairpinning major chords, might as well have been lifted straight off one of the lesser Air albums. If you like all that stuff and you're forgiving enough that you're willing to put up with a band that does slightly inferior versions of same while simultaneously somehow sounding uncannily like the Moody Blues, well, these are the dudes for you. Everyone else: to the Roulé back catalogues you go."

Over the past five years, I've heard music nerds-- mostly soul fanatics-- unload crazy amounts of bile on that record, but their most propagated criticisms (""soul with all the black parts removed,"" ""music for lattes"") strike me as having too much in common with the rockist's critique of pop to take seriously. Even calling Zero 7 a bad soul outfit would be to miss the point; if anything, with its revolving cast of lead vocalists and electro-acousticisms, this stuff was meant to fill the space left by trip-hop's demise. (That the only people who felt that loss happened to be Starbucks drinkers was a total and utter coincidence.)Oh man, see? This is such an easy band to mock. They're earnest and conservative and heavy-handed and swim in such deeply unfashionable waters, they have only cod for company-- cod-jazz, cod-soul, cod-funk. But in a strange way, their painful sincerity and abiding uncoolness is what keeps me defending that first record; because it's good despite those things, and on a larger scale, it's a heartening reminder that nothing merits pre-emptive dismissal. So yeah, for a short spell back in 2001, Zero 7 was a three-legged chihuahua that had just won a dog show, and that endeared me to them. But not anymore guys, I'm sorry. So: I'm going to open the car door now, and you're going to awkwardly hop out and maybe go see what's behind that wheatfield over there while I drive away.Actually, there's one song here I really like. That's ""Futures"", one of a handful featuring José González on vocals. On its own, González's dry, folksy vocal is 1970s enough, so it's no surprise it should be so well-suited to Henry Binn and Sam Hardaker's buttoned-up production style. With its spiralling acoustic riff and appropriately burbly sonics, its gorgeously languid sheen makes you wonder if, next time out, Zero 7 wouldn't be wise to acknowledge their inner-Gerry Rafferty and head straight for the punchbowl marked ""MOR"".That would, without question, be better than what we get here, which-- barring two other González tracks, ""Left Behind"" and ""Today""-- is a warmed-over stew of scrubbed-up psychedelia, scrubbed-up sunshine pop, scrubbed-up soundtrack music, electrofunk, and lounge that's all produced immaculately, right down to the ""messy"" parts. In addition to González, The Garden's other major guest is Sia Furler, who contributes songwriting credits and vocals to six of its 12 tracks. While I like Sia-- even despite her affected vocal and her nagging tendency to oversing-- this is not her finest hour. ""Catch a falling star/ You'll go far/ In the pageant of the bizarre/ And tonight I give you my heart,"" goes the cloying fairground pop of ""Pageant of the Bizarre"", before spinning off into an ill-advised Beach Boys vocal outro.Even worse are the perfunctory instrumental tracks-- the pseudo-broken beat of ""Seeing Things"" and the midnight jazz of ""Your Place""-- which only further mottle the record's intent and give the impression that, if left to their own devices, Zero 7's principles would rather be making a Ninja Tune record. I don't know what I'd rather they were doing, but I do know that this is so tasteful I'm going to need about six hours with Boris to get right again."

The group still leans hard on their most beloved sounds: single-note guitar peals that bounce off springing reverb, softly mumbled vocals, thick bass riffs, and big, billowy swaths of synthesizer. But while they once had a sort of rainy-day murk about them, these textures now sparkle like burnished silver.Certainly, the transformation is a good look for a band that spent too long playing in the shadows. The pitch-shifted samples and electro-drum rattles of ""Heart Full of Pentagons"" give a slick and stylish underpinning to Greg Bertens' unusually forceful vocals. ""Heart"" is a definite career highlight, starting off an album-opening triad where Film School sound like they're on the verge of establishing a distinctiveness that their prior work lacked. ""When I'm Yours"" and ""Time to Listen"" are hard-charging and simultaneously spooky, something closer to the Cure at their most post-punk. And while the group still isn't going to be known for big hooks, the double-time kick of ""Distant Life"" and ""Sunny Day"" are accessible enough to frame Film School as students of the pop side of shoegaze as opposed to just the blown-out part.Despite of all the sonic additions, the album's urgency is what feels most new. When Fission is at its best, you feel like Film School was tiring of being a band that could accurately call an album Hideout. Though the airhorn guitar blast of ""Waited"" would've fit on their prior records, here it feels like a veil of secrecy has been lifted on an intimate conversation between Bertens and bassist Lorelei Plotczyk. But then the energy seems to float away during the pleasant but anodyne electronic indie-pop of Fission's midsection.To play off something Jayson Greene wrote on this site last year, whether it's gangsta rap or Appalachian folk, there's always a pleasure in hearing an artist expertly working within the parameters of their idealized form of music. In Film School's case, that terrain encompasses pretty much anything that's ever been released on the 4AD label or held the appellate of ""-gaze."" The problem is that their particular field never lacks for competition, and when a younger act like Wild Nothing or the Depreciation Guild puts their own stamp on this sound by stressing a winsome melodicism or electronic trickery, you get a weird disappointment from the fact that Fission is Film School's most diverse album to date. In some ways, the diversity works against them. Rather than establishing their own identity or finally making the leap from good to great, they simply remind you of more bands than they did before."

Could not be more excited. Think of when you’re visiting a friend’s house for the first time and they warmly warn you about how their bull mastiff can be awfully playful around new friends. It could be doing absolutely nothing all day and the moment you step in the door, they spring into action to waylay you with slobbering affection. And if you act surprised, or god forbid, resist it, you’re going to look like kind of an asshole. Sound familiar? Got that? Still in? Cool, because that’s pretty much what happens the moment you press play on Galore.As far as what it sounds like, well, if the name “Thumpers” brings to mind the adorable rabbit from Bambi doing his thing on giant floor toms, you’re on the right track. The fifth track on Galore is called “Come on Strong”, and it’s the record’s thematic mission statement, filled as it is with extroverted melodies, booming, insistent drums and glimmering production. It’s cute, percussive, motormouthed music that’s particularly prevalent and successful in Thumpers’ neck of the woods. But, god bless Thumpers, they don’t want to alienate a single one of you, so singles like “Unkinder (A Tougher Love)” and “Dancing’s Done” bound forward like Winnie the Pooh and his gang, and for better or worse, they forgo the eccentricities of their peers—they aren’t as glitchy as Alt-J, as annoyingly overstuffed as Everything Everything, or as flaccid as Two Door Cinema Club. By the same token, they aren’t as adventurous as Bombay Bicycle Club or dancefloor-oriented as John Hamson, Jr.’s former gig Friendly Fires.In fact, Thumpers sound downright American—partly because they draw a lot of their sounds from post-Feels Animal Collective, but also due to their shock and awe policy of performing cannonballs without any concern for the splashback. Though a field recording of London’s idyllic Regent’s Canal graces opener “Marvel”, look at the cover, for crying out loud. These songs take place in swimming pools, but their aw-shucks attitude suggest they’re swimming holes. Likewise, even if the dominant theme in these songs are making your most treasured summer memories right now, they’re so stoked about them that they’re just going to drop Galore right in the middle of February. They just can’t wait three more months."

Since 2009, recording mostly as FunkinEven, the London electronic musician has specialized in a jubilantly no-frills strain of house and techno. His rugged workouts for a stripped-down setup of synthesizer and drum machine are unvarnished, unfussy, and unsentimental. Often recorded in single takes, they have a gestural quality to them, like the arc of a hand slicing through air. And they tend to move in one direction: forward.A lot of the same qualities hold true for Fallen, his debut album, and his first major release under his own name. It’s not lo-fi, exactly, but it's proudly bare bones, giving no corner to excess. There’s no advanced digital signal processing here, no fantastical sound design, no psychoacoustic sleight-of-hand—just gnarled acid sequences, bare-knuckle drum programming, and drifting synths. In most cases, the technology behind these tunes hasn’t changed much, if at all, in the past 30-odd years; nor, for that matter, has their style.He covers a lot of ground: “Jedi” is smooth, pinging techno in the vein of Jeff Mills or Robert Hood. “XL,” which he made some 15 years ago, as he told The Wire, brandishing an old floppy disc on which he'd saved the song, teases rolling jazz piano over an excitable house rhythm, ragged filters in constant motion. “Kingdom” is a spacious, starry-eyed acid cut similar to Joey Anderson or Levon Vincent; its structure is simple, but the dimensions suggested by its spiraling arpeggios are vast and expansive. “Reficul” is a greasy, mean-mugging drum-machine fugue in the spirit of “Night,” a 2012 collaboration with Kyle Hall under their Funkinevil alias, and “Disciple” is a thrilling explosion of breakbeats and stuttering horn stabs that throws off energy as though exorcising demons.But Fallen also marks an important shift from Julien’s earlier work. While there are plenty of storming club cuts here, the whole thing is more varied, more nuanced, and more contemplative than any other record in his catalog. “Begins,” an ambient miniature that opens the record with mercurial timbres and complex harmonies, sets up a full-on jazz fusion number in the form of “Chantel,” flush with digital chimes, flute synth, and squirrely bass work reminiscent of Jaco Pastorius or Stanley Clarke. (It comes as no surprise to learn that Julien cites Plastic People’s Co-Op parties as a major influence; jazz fusion and electric soul played a huge part in the development of the broken-beat aesthetic.)"

Unfortunately.","Who's been responsible for The Blueprint 3's biggest PR boost thus far: Kanye West or Rihanna? Timbaland or Drake? Um, LeBron James? According to our RSS, the answer would appear to be Ed Droste. Now, a few years ago, a YouTube of Jay-Z swaying lazily to ""Ready, Able"" might've been a ""gotcha"" moment worthy of the Summer Jam Screen, but in 2009, the buzz it's generated is either a huge breakthrough for the hip-hop/indie conversation or a sign that seeing Jigga in the same room as Grizzly Bear is more exciting than hearing him on the same song as any of the all-stars that populate The Blueprint 3: After all, The Blueprint 3 is so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if Kingdom Come was somehow underrated.While ""30 Something"" and ""Beach Chair"" might stand as some of the most smug hip-hop ever committed to tape, they at least came from a real place, which illustrated the ""curse"" Jay so often speaks of: Nearly all of his LP's are concept albums about the state of his career, but in the 21st century, he's needed some sort of external boost to make it work, whether it's announcing his dominance of New York, his retirement, or the ability to play fast and loose with Frank Lucas' biography. Maybe it's just the timing, but like any recent MTV VMA's, Blueprint 3 generates its event-ness from a stubborn belief in its own ability to be an event. As such, most of it finds Jay-Z dealing in contradictory impulses-- to remind listeners of his unparalleled success in the rap game, but just as often, imploring everyone to stop thinking about his unparalleled success and get on some ill-defined ""next shit.""Honest question-- did Kanye West pull an inside job on Big Brother here? I mean, he gets all the good lines on ""Run This Town"" and getting Jay to follow his punchdrunk, slouchy flow on ""Hate"" has to be the result of some bar bet. But it isn't a matter of Kanye fronting him bad beats as much as a state of mind, the sort of maniacal need for approval that often humanizes Kanye but just makes Jay-Z sound insecure and whiny (see: most of The Blueprint 2). ""Niggas want my old shit/ Buy my old album,"" he sneers in ""On to the Next One"" over a hyperactive Swizz Beatz track that indicates Jay's not the only one trying to sum up his entire career within the span of four minutes. But ""Thank You"", ""Reminder"", and ""So Ambitious"" all go to great lengths to reiterate accomplishments that we've heard dozens of time, but without naming names, they ultimately feel toothless considering his detractors in 2009's rap game are almost incapable of being taken seriously."

What he doesn't have, however, is their knack for writing lyrics to rattle anyone's whole worldview.","Wale’s third official album, The Gifted, had the bad luck to come out a week after Kanye’s Yeezus. It’s terrible timing for any pop album; for the former backpack rapper who found unexpected mainstream pop success who went into the studio to attempt a singular, definitive artistic statement, it's bound to set up some unfair comparisons. There’s also a vaguely beefy line in “Heaven’s Afternoon” about how Wale wears Givenchy but doesn’t wear kilts that doesn’t help the situation.That said, the fact that Wale’s decided to release such a left-field pop rap record at this point in his career is respectably daring. In fact, it’s probably the most daring thing about The Gifted. For all its differences from Wale's closest chart competitors, the music here (at least on the first half of the record) follows a path that was cleared as far back as the 90s: using the warm and lushly organic sound of peak-era Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder to reconnect hip-hop with a soulful revolutionary legacy that it turned away from when MCs started going in over 808 beats. It's not original, but it's a good path to follow. (Chicago rapper Tree recently used a similar approach on his mixtape, Sunday School II: When Church Lets Out, probably one of the best rap records that’ll be released this year.)The music on The Gifted sounds fantastic, with intricately arranged keys and strings, stacks of soul and gospel-inspired backup vocals, and deep, rubbery bass lines. The problem is that Wale and his team made a really decent soul rap album without a rapper soulful enough to carry it. He’s a capable, sometimes personable MC, but he’s not an especially compelling one. His approach to the album’s more explicitly soul-oriented tracks is to intersperse his library of 2013 rap cliches about his personal struggle to success with the occasional line about social injustice. The combination is a jumbled, awkward mess, capped by a wasted guest appearance by Jerry Seinfeld on an excruciatingly unfunny dialogue with Wale on The Gifted's outro. He’s attempting to tap into the magic that Marvin and Stevie created back then, but his understanding of what they did is bafflingly shallow. Wale seems to think that those records succeeded by their string arrangements and keyboard tones, and with accurate enough reproductions of those at his fingertips, he breezes past the part about writing lyrics that resonate with an audience enough to rattle their whole worldview. After days of listening to The Gifted on nearly constant rotation I can’t remember a single line from it."

Claiming to have recorded their album on the West Coast of Australia, where the Swan River meets the Indian Ocean, the two musicians dove into Balearic’s deepest pools, where aquamarine strains of ambient music swirled with new age at its most beatific. Limpid synthesizers, nylon-stringed acoustic guitar, and the occasional keening clarinet solo pooled together as effortlessly as the ice melting in a Campari glass.As Andras Fox, Wilson had previously been known for Larry Heard-inspired deep house, while Tanner’s Eleventeen Eston project had put a lo-fi spin on big-budget 1980s pop, sounding like he’d dug up a sun-baked cassette of Tears for Fears’ demo instrumentals. But as Wilson Tanner, they achieved a newfound purity. On II, they continue with their debut album’s line of investigation but add a twist to the thought experiment: What if a cold front descended upon their Antipodean paradise?The elements of II have not much changed—their synthesizers remain fluid, their tempos bob pleasantly along, and the maritime conceit is borne out in the sound of actual waves against the prow. (The two say they wrote and recorded the new album aboard a 1950s riverboat in Melbourne’s Port Philipp Bay, utilizing “a resourceful array of weatherproof electronic instruments and a long extension lead,” which, sure!) It’s a dawdler’s paradise, a daydream mapped to MIDI. A few songs could have worked just as well on the duo’s debut: The faux-flute melody of “Loch and Key” sways lazily; “All Hands Bury the Dead” sinks into a mind-clearing keyboard refrain that’s accompanied by the sounds of birdcalls and splashing oars.But there’s a noticeable chill in the air. “Perishable” wraps up melancholy flute and guitar in tendrils of analog delay, suggesting a kind of dubbed-out death folk.“Killcord Pts I-III” fires up churning arpeggios, drizzles in dissolving marimbas, and stews in its own juices for 12 uneasy minutes. The darkest and most adventurous of all is “Idle,” where acid-like bass tones bubble and squelch against lurching electronic rhythms and an almost inaudible layer of feedback. It’s not far from something that Aphex Twin might have put out on his label Rephlex in the early 1990s, and it makes for a provocative new dimension to the duo’s sound. After all, with sea levels rising and coastlines disappearing, blissful drifting only gets you so far."

The Vancouver trio includes but one Courtney, née Courtney Garvin, who rips vivid fuzz-guitar riffs alongside bassist Sydney Koke and singer/drummer Jen Twynn Payne. Their music—a bit gray, slightly lopsided—recalls velvety 1980s kiwi acts such as the Clean and Look Blue Go Purple. Crucially, though, the Courtneys bust out of the ramshackle Dunedin sound with bold, driving arrangements and thrilling pop sense. They have covered U2’s “I Will Follow” live and mention the influence of Teenage Fanclub and Big Star. Accordingly, the Courtneys feel like a punkish band with clearly-outlined emotions and a cheekily arena-rock spirit. On their supremely catchy second album, II, they lock into a real groove. They tactfully pair simplicity and strength. They make sad songs sound like a blast.Something about the presence of a singer/drummer always communicates a discernible vulnerability. It emphasizes just how badly this person wants a voice—enough to carry both a tune and a beat—and turns a song into an act of conviction. To a degree, this amplifies the reaching emotionality of II. Singing in her endearingly nasal tone across the album, Payne is—to borrow a phrase from That Dog—totally crushed out.Payne has said II is “75% about crushes,” which feels like a modest appraisal. Though there are more oblique songs about iron deficiency, the movie Lost Boys, a distant Virgo, and alien abduction, the bulk of II is about longing—the harshest emotion. “Can’t get you out of my head/Even through the miles,” Payne sings wistfully on “Silver Velvet.” It feels like driving into a sunset, and the bubblegum sentiment at its heart (“And nothing you say!/And nothing you do!/Can stop me from thinkin’ about you!”) sounds squarely fit to be shouted into hairbrush-microphones everywhere. Through the many disarming hooks of “Minnesota,” she pines, “I never wanted you to go/But you had to.” Likewise, “Country Song” is liminal: “I know I’m going but I don’t know when,” Payne sings.Among all of these uncertain feelings, the music of II is appealingly concrete. II is a lovesick album, but its songs lift off. There’s a steadiness to its build, a comforting antidote to all of the unsteady urges. Even the seven-minute jam of “Lost Boys” is sharp and measured, never losing itself. The sun-streaked riffs of “Tour” pry open like a window on a long highway drive. It sprawls, capturing the restlessness that comes with transience, grounding a self-help mantra: “What you are and what you want to be/It takes a long time.” On “25,” Payne fruitlessly chases the object of her affection, and she evokes the true emotional horror of a two-sided gemini: “I’m a gemini/And I change my mind/Always change my mind.”"

Warm fuzzies are in short supply; doubt and discontent prevail. Think of Huerco S.’s lo-fi churn, Sarah Davachi’s stark drones, or Egyptrixx’s battered futurism. But there are some glorious summers hiding in Suzanne Kraft’s recent What You Get for Being Young and Brian Eno’s latest generative composition Reflection, which often evoked the stillness of an autumn evening. Also retreating from icy climes is the German duo Vermont, who've followed up their self-titled 2014 debut with an ambient album far warmer and more beautiful than its predecessor.Vermont was an unexpected development from Danilo Plessow and Marcus Worgull, the two artists behind the project. Plessow made his name in the late ’00s making crisp, finely crafted house and disco as Motor City Drum Ensemble, while Worgull has spent the past dozen years refining his minimalist house epics for the Innervisions label. And while Kompakt has made a cottage industry out of ambient thanks to the label’s annual Pop Ambient compilations, Vermont sounded different. It grew out of a series of open-ended studio jams using a battery of vintage analog gear, which was both its biggest strength and weakness. The record sounded wonderful—a feast for the ears—but its cycling arpeggios and drifting pads occasionally lacked direction, often feeling less like the work of a single ensemble than a compilation by a number of artists who loved all things Can and kosmische.On II, Plessow and Worgull are back behind iconic workhorses like the Moog Prodigy and Arp Odyssey, synthesizers renowned for their buttery tone. The results feel clearer this time; they’ve honed in on a narrower set of sounds across the length of the album, leading to a much more cohesive listen. Additionally, they’ve opted to go without any drums at all, and most tracks utilize just a three elements: bassline, midrange arpeggio, and contrapuntal leads weaving high overhead. Their spare arrangements and measured tempos allow each electronic voice to come into focus. While artfully layering simple lines and lavishing attention on timbre, panning, and legato, they stir up an enveloping sound that makes the most of its underlying waveforms.Once again, krautrock’s ambient electronic strains remain their primary inspiration; the plucked guitar of “Norderney” invokes Manuel Göttsching’s Inventions for Electric Guitar; airy tracks like “Dschuna” and “Gebirge” draw inspiration from Cluster and Brian Eno. Looking further afield, the burnished, detuned tones of “Chemtrails” recall Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II. And in “Ki-Bou,” a riff inspired by Larry Heard’s bright, agile basslines amplifies the music’s field of vision. Mostly, though, these aren't stylistic exercises but carefully distilled mood pieces. In “Hallo von der Anderen Seite,” a rippling synthesizer melody wraps circles around a plucked mbira, and given the music’s fanciful qualities, it’s easy to imagine it as an animated still life, or a conversation between potted plants. “Wenik”—named after the birch rods that sauna-goers use to stimulate the circulation—suggests two colored liquids mixing together in slow motion.Though the average track length hovers around the four-minute mark, many of these sequences could, like most ambient music, go on indefinitely. But Vermont have figured out how to make these comparatively short, sketch-like pieces work for them. They stretch out just long enough to draw you in and wrap you up in their atmospheres, but they never wear out their welcome. Like most kosmische musicians, Vermont dream big—but never at the expense of the small, tactile details at their fingertips."

Their second full-length is a double album—a ballsy and potentially dangerous move for a band who operate best when their songs are kept tight.","On an episode of ""WTF With Marc Maron"", Mikal Cronin spoke about the scene he, Ty Segall, and Charles Moothart came up in during high school. As he explained it, he would throw parties at his parents' house in Laguna Beach, and their small circle of musician friends would write songs and start bands specifically for the events. Different combinations of the same people were getting together and exploring different vibes. ""You guys still do that,"" Maron observed. And he's right. This year alone, Segall has been juggling several projects. His circle of friends and collaborators (Moothart, Meatbodies' Chad Ubovich, Wand's Cory Hanson, Thee Oh Sees' John Dwyer, and Cronin) all tend to have multiple irons in the fire.Those high school bands weren't focused on long-term sustainability; they were momentary sparks of creative energy. To this day, the best moment in the life of any new Segall project is the first spark. The introductory taste of new music from these bands offers the opportunity to parse how aesthetic and personnel differences define the music—to hear what separates it from prior work, what makes it exciting, and what the chances are that the project will outlive the confines of a 7"". Segall and Moothart's band Fuzz made a strong first impression with their debut 2012 single ""Fuzz's Fourth Dream"". It was a showcase for Moothart's guitar solo mastery, the band's stellar hook work, the effortless way they can slink into a groove, and Segall's ace drumming. With 2013's Fuzz, the proto-metal-worshipping power trio became a proven entity—a well-oiled machine with a few strong songs. The lineup now features Ubovich, and if you only take into account his impressive work as Meatbodies' frontman, it seems Fuzz have only become more powerful.Fuzz's second full-length, II, is a double album—a ballsy and potentially dangerous move for a band who operate best when their songs are kept tight. Their Fuzz track ""Loose Sutures"", for example, went a bit too loose and lost its momentum about halfway in. More than half of II's songs are over four minutes long, and the longest one of the bunch is the most disappointing of them all. The final 14-minute track, ""II"", is an obligatory instrumental sequel to Fuzz's instrumental closer ""One"". Where ""One"" ramps up the power and velocity of its central hook, ""II"" never quite figures out exactly where it's going. It changes course several times, and along the way, a question emerges—how much Fuzz is too much?"

True to his word, II is another snarling beast of a record, 10 more all-lunging, all-screaming anti-anthems crammed into another chaotic, cloistered half-hour, every inch as grotty and combustible and unfriendly as its predecessor. Once again produced by Holy Fuck's Graham Walsh and engineered by Alex Bonefant, II is a refinement, not a reinvention: if you liked Metz, well, have another.Metz spent five years honing their considerable strengths—Edkins' caustic fretwork and vocal agita, Hayden Menzies and Chris Slorach's stampeding low-end—before unleashing their self-titled debut. And, on II, they seem to feel no particular need to tinker around with what got them here. They still draw most of their inspiration from turn-of-the-'90s post-hardcore and the Nirvana albums on either side of Nevermind, and they still believe three-and-a-half minutes is about as long as any song has the right to be. The terse II comes in a smidge less rigid than its predecessor, a shade or two darker, a touch more physical. Not that you'll notice; once the bassline of opener ""Acetate"" takes hold, for 30 short minutes, your thoughts become a smear of white. These songs are not ""catchy"" by any traditional metric; they don't so much get stuck in your head as get lodged in your skin.Metz take great pains to avoid your standard verse-chorus-verse structures, and II, even more than the debut, downplays the traditionally ""songier"" aspects of these songs for a series of weaponized strikes. Still, beyond a few drop-outs and punch-ins, these songs all seem to gnash about in a fairly similar fashion. Hayden Menzies' bull-in-a-China-shop drums are unrelenting, but they rarely push too far past their original tempo; Edkins talks his way through a few of these verses, but he's every bit as likely to start off in a full-on wail, and his riffs, while bludgeoning from the get-go, never seem quite sure how to up their own antes.All of this makes the first 20 or so seconds of any Metz song roughly as thrilling as the last 20, which gives II the feeling of falling down the same set of stairs ten times in a row. There is not, as Edkins promised, anything for the radio on II, but neither is there much attempt to chart new territory, no ambitious gambits or radical tempo-shifts, nothing they haven't already proven themselves capable of in the past. These songs barely give themselves space to meander or develop; they pull the cord, and off they go. By and large, they perform their seethe-pummel-repeat routine with an almost mechanized precision. This one thing, they do incredibly well. Then they do it nine more times."

On his new album, the music has grown trickier, but it hasn’t ranged far from what Moon B laid down on his first singles.","It’s fitting that Sussegad, the first 12” offering from Moon B, was pressed onto wax whose swirl of black and gray resembled smoke. The Atlanta-based producer (also known as Wes Gray) makes music that has qualities similar to that peculiar element: the music obfuscates its origins, has an untenable aspect to its sound and, well, it sounds better when you’re smoking something on a basement couch, at once digging the beat while similarly forgetting just what it is you’re listening to.Gray’s debut album was released on the Washington, D.C. imprint Peoples Potential Unlimited in 2012 without much in the way of cover art, or even song titles. Much like the other releases on that imprint, Moon B’s music favors miasma over certainty, avoiding easy genre characterization while also drawing on distinct musical tropes of the early 1980s. Much like his fellow labelmate Benedek, the music that Moon B releases is made from a mix of hardware, drum machines and samples of cheap 12”s that might never get ID’d by anyone beyond the most obscure of DJs.In some ways, Moon B’s new album, II, is a step up: the production is a little crisper, the tracks have titles, and there’s actually sleeve art, in this case a peculiar painting of an African-American man standing in the middle of the road at night, a chicken in one hand, his other raised in a fist. Not much is expanded upon beyond that, though, and while the music itself has grown trickier, it hasn’t ranged far from what he laid down on his first singles.Opener “Gulls” begins with the sound of eerie analog keyboards from Music has the Right to Children-era Boards of Canada before canned handclaps take over, the track meandering into such disparate zones as synth-funk, '80s B-boy soundtracks, and smooth jazz without ever quite landing in one: pop and lock to it, or else just chill until the track dissolves back into white noise. The album standout is also the track with the best title: “Stank Tartare.” The synth bass is queasy and deep and slightly warped, as if originating from an obscure funk tape left on the dashboardone summer afternoon. “Green Sky” has the kind of stiff yet rubberbanding rhythm to it that connects the dots between Kraftwerk and Whodini.Funk, soul, boogie, jazz, R&B, electro, New Age, even touches of house music: all sorts of familiar yet unmoored sounds emerge from Moon B’s haze, and nothing remains in focus for long. When some tracks begin, it already seems like they have the potential to take divergent paths, from a thumping house track or else a woozy early garage house instrumental—or, if it's Moon B's wish, a narrow path between the two.Yet, in touching on all these genres and running them through all sorts of samplers and drum machines (among the listed equipment used: Kawai K1, ESQ-1, Roland Alpha Juno 1, Yamaha DX21, Korg Microsampler, Tascam 424), there’s one thing curiously absent from the above list of genres: hip-hop. His working methods are not dissimilar from any post-Dilla hip-hop producers, but Moon B presents a parallel world in which hip-hop never happened, where the beats are dope but not dope enough where someone would drop rhymes atop them. I wonder how these tracks might change with someone else on them, but for now, the music produces an uncanny feeling, like the presence of smoke but no real fire."

Their new album is an interior and personal record of constricted scope, one of unhinged beauty that can be wrested from longing and anger.","There’s a tendency in American culture to use foreign punk bands to gain insight to another nation’s political and emotional tenor, and that’s just not gonna work with Sweden’s Makthaverskan. Though a reaction to what they considered to be a conformist, “happy and cute” indie scene in Gothenburg, II is an interior and personal record of constricted scope, occurring entirely within Maja Milner: in her blood, in her head, in her body, in her room. Beyond that, who knows what else is going on in the world—but that’s the whole point of II, a record of unhinged beauty that can be wrested from longing and anger. At times it feels threatening enough to render all other concerns inconsequential.The cramped confines of II are indicative of its attitude, a desire to get the fuck away from somewhere, whether it’s a torturous relationship, a mental straightjacket, or a shitty mood. For the most part, Makthaverskan flit through decades of genre variations (dream-pop, melodic post-punk, and so on) that are typically lumped into “bedsit music”. However, its punk ethos and intensity make it all feel like a crying fit so physically severe that you’re actually sore afterwards.Makthaverskan try to soar with makeshift wings on II, and more often than not, the results are charming rather than awkward. Glistening guitar leads occasionally stumble upon a bum note, drums get lost in swirl of reverb if they let up the intensity. Regardless, it’s rare to hear a singer who can flat-out project like Milner__—the leaps of faith she takes before hitting the skyscraping notes that punctuate the daring introductory duo of “Antabus” and “Asleep” are captivating to the point where sometimes it seems like she’s only utilizing a small fraction of her powers. But as with the rest of her band, Milner is less compelling on songs that require a bit more finesse;__ when “Drömland” drops the 100,000,000th “Be My Baby” drum intro and “Something More” runs through facile midtempo, mid-career Cure, it comes off as strangely sheepish. Consequently, there are points where Milner’s voices gets a bit too piercing amidst the unbalanced mix__—__it’s the effect of cleaning your ear with a Q-Tip and going in a little too far.But then again, II takes on the form of what happens to people who’ve gone a little too far putting themselves out there—the “never again” visceral reaction one has after getting screwed by their vulnerability. (It's worth noting that “Antabus” is named after a drug which elicits a violent reaction in alcoholics when they relapse.) While little of II’s vitriol is lost in translation, there is no English equivalent for the band name: “The woman with the power” is as close as we can get.And yet, Milner’s lyrics can be categorized into three stages of trying to recapture that power rather than owning it: ""Don’t go"", ""Please come back"", and ""Fuck you, leave"". At times, the latter is literally what it comes down to__:__ there’s no real chorus to “Antabus”, just a refrain of “I don’t know what to say/ So fuck you!/ Fuck you!” Fittingly, “No Mercy” is even more direct__,__ as Milner yells, “Fuck you for fucking me when I was 17...You never loved me/You wanted to own me."" The fine and crucial semantic distinctions of “fuck” apparently cross the language barrier and throughout II, there isn’t much romantic love, just the romanticization of young lust and teen angst. Those are part of the same continuum, though and when II taps into its eternal power, the cries from Milner’s bedroom nothing short of universal."

The major differences between II and their self-titled debut is that their sonic sensibilities have grown more refined and compelling, and that the world of electronic music has just about caught up to them.","Berlin has a well-deserved reputation for producing aggressively tasteful minimal techno but it also has a warmer, more human side that doesn’t often attract the same level of attention. At the forefront of that scene are Apparat (aka Sascha Ring) and Modeselektor (the duo of Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary), and their 2009 album as Moderat was a massive, supergroup-level event for a very, very particular kind of electronic music fan.After several productive years apart, the trio has reconvened for a second full-length. Four years is a long time in the fast-moving dance music world (more than enough time for whole genres to bloom, wither, and die), but Ring, Bronsert, and Szary have picked up pretty much exactly where they left off. The major differences between II and their self-titled debut is that their sonic sensibilities have grown more refined and compelling, and that the world has just about caught up to them.Luckily the album’s weakest moment comes early on, and is therefore quickly dealt with. “Bad Kingdom”, II’s first song after a brief intro, has a wicked instrumental bed with a sparse breakbeat drum part and growling sawtooth synths-- if it had been released a few months earlier, Kanye might have sampled it on Yeezus somewhere. But it’s topped by a vocal that’s afflicted with the kind of generic Euro-soul inflection that American ears have a hard time dealing with, and the juxtaposition between the aggressive synths and airy pop vocals weakens the former rather than creating an interesting contrast.Things pick up after that. The trio seem intent on exploring (and blurring) the line some electronic music fans draw between “dancefloor listening” and “headphone listening.” They favor unhurried tempos, and tend to emphasize texture over melody, but it’s not simply chill-out music either. “Let in the Light” runs at considerably lower BPM than the average peak-hour banger, but the echo-laden-yet-punchy drums, swelling synth chords, and a far stronger vocal melody than the one on “Bad Kingdom” make it easy to imagine how it could provide an amped-up crowd going off to it if the right DJ was daring enough to drop it in a mix.The album peaks right around its midpoint with the track “Milk”, which over 10 minutes evolves from the barest rhythmic sketch embellished with a few ambient sounds into an swarm of pulsing synths drifting in clouds of white noise, the whole time repeating one brief melodic line that somehow gets more compelling the more it repeats. It lacks the hard edges and aggressive drive that most big-room rave anthems are built from, but it’s still precisely engineered to produce the same kind of world-shaking late night epiphany.Moderat was a peculiar sounding album at the time. Outside of dubstep and a burgeoning drum & bass revival, breakbeats weren’t really in fashion, and some of the songs were structured like pop songs and boasted pop vocal parts but were still sonically rooted in the sounds of the electronic fringe. Since then a two-step renaissance has bubbled up out of the remnants of the underground dubstep scene and spread throughout dance music, and as pop radio moves increasingly EDM-ward listeners have made weird synthesized sounds de rigueur in the mainstream. So II is just about perfectly synchronized with the zeitgeist, and if it’s not a flawlessly executed record, it still seems capable of making the most out of its moment."

Psychedelic warriors Föllakzoid hail from Santiago, Chile, but-- with their rigid rhythms, their chemtrail synths, their afterburner guitars-- their sound is pure Düsseldorf, circa 1971. But this krautrock-worshiping quartet's fascination with all things kosmische isn't merely musical: their primary concern seems to be untethering themselves from the earth. Their debut leaned toward desert rock, but the interplanetarily minded II is a bold shift in perspective from their earthbound origins, an all-out swing into a very different sound that follows its own alien logic. For Föllakzoid, though, space seems to be the place.Vocalist Juan Pablo Rodrigues, with his unbudging deadpan, spends much of II playing the ghost in the machine. So when he starts muttering ""is it getting lonely?"" as ""9"" intensifies, you wind up feel in positively marooned, all alone while the track's latticework tightens. And even as the song lengths skirt double-digits, Föllakzoid's commands your attention. Just as you start to admire the music's weightless beauty of the synths and guitars, they seem to close in on you. While ""Trees"" throbs, guitarist Domingo Garcia-Huidobro provides the scenery, his massive, ever-expanding riff drawing up the topography of the cosmos. Keeping the rhythm section lean and the synths fairly sleek and steely might seem to put a lot of pressure on Garcia-Huidobro's guitar. But he, too, knows when to step up, and more importantly, when to hold back. This keen sense of drama means every time ""Trees"" brings that riff around again, it's not just a reprise, it's an event. ""99"" plays like a Dali painting, every surface ripples like a pond, every instrument double-helixing around itself.I've seen a 12-minute version of ""Pulsar"" floating around; mine's 15. Either way, ""Pulsar"" takes a little too long to get going, and doesn't do quite enough when it does. Once its initial pulsations melt away, a Deodato-style mecha-disco groove floats to the surface, one too troubled to ever quite lock into. II's vastness is impressive, but between Rodrigues' inhuman mumble and the way every note seems to echo off some faraway mountain, certain stretches feel a bit barren. And all the sci-fi I've ever watched has me conditioned to expect a third-act payoff greater than the one II provides; Föllakzoid would like you think some atom-smasher's just around the next turn, but there's no such blowout here, just a few smaller skirmishes. Still, this is strange new terrain for Föllakzoid, and they go after it boldly, conjuring worlds in the process."

And for good reason, as K-X-P are band not to be trusted, perhaps even feared. Take the Finnish group's regrettably overlooked but excellent self-titled 2010 debut, which orbited a smorgasbord of maximalist pop fragments around lockstep motorik rhythms, ultimately leaving brains pleasantly gooped like a sous-vide egg. But it's with II that the self-proclaimed ""anti-band"" has taken things to a new level, as Kaukolampi has attested to infusing their sound with ""free jazz, drone, noise, pop, rock,"" with an overall emphasis on trying to tap into something ""more punk."" He's even adopted a sort of alter ego, combining the personalities of ""a lunatic occult reverend, a yoga teacher, John Lydon, Freddie Mercury and Rob Halford."" Because why not? For a band that should've gotten your attention the first time around, there's no better time to fly off the handle a little bit than with your sophomore release.K-X-P aren't bullshitting you; II is both more ambitious and vaster in scope than its predecessor, a record that pushes their most far-out tendencies to their respective limits. It is, however, less extreme than Kaukolampi's screeds would have you believe, assuredly the work of a band now very different than from the one that made K-X-P. A set of austere horns leads you into the album's first proper track and single ""Melody"", as arpeggiations chatter back and forth in ways that will likely remind you of the last Cut Copy full-length. Once the rhythm section locks in place (this is a band that features two drummers, after all), majestic synths build, and the track morphs into something of a coronation, an almost goofy baptismal. It's clear that K-X-P are a band newly unencumbered, beholden to no specific guiding principles. It's this sense of freedom that makes II an engaging, at times very exciting listen, but it also doesn't lead to much cohesion. K-X-P spend most of their time with their heads barely above water, but instead of merely treading, it feels as if they're betting alongside you as to whether or not they'll eventually go under. Needless to say, there's action to be had, and the results are always unexpected.As a record peppered with tiny little interludes (a snatch of opera runs backwards, synths plink like drops of water, etc.) that stitch things together loosely, it's clear that this recording is intended to be approached as a kind of journey. To paraphrase Robert Downey Jr., you never go full prog, but K-X-P's could-give-a-fuck-ness often trumps the pitfalls of similarly minded efforts. A good portion of these songs do sound like miniature campaigns, chugging forward at various intervals, often as sprawling as K-X-P was tightly coiled. But the heartbeat at the core of II is a human one, rising and falling as dictated by the chaos or heady expanse of these varied environments. So it makes sense that there are now vocals on every proper track, and while they may not always be the wisest inclusion, it's hard to fault Kaukolampi and co. for working outside of their comfort zone."

So far in 2012, the two best examples come from opposite ends of the world: The fine Leaving Atlanta by Georgian tunesmith Gentleman Jesse, and the spirit-lifting self-titled debut by Australia's Royal Headache. You know the reference points for this music: mid-period Replacements, early Elvis Costello, all-eras Tom Petty. These records exist at the intersection of middle-American punk and heartland classic rock. No matter what is happening in the rest of the world musically, there are always people-- mainly young, scruffy-haired white guys, though women sometimes get in on the act, too-- who write snappy, no-frills three-minute pop-rock songs, and then package them into 10-song, 30-minute records. It has nothing to do with being fashionable. Certainly, the world doesn't necessarily ""need"" more records like this, which is why they eventually tend to languish in record-collector obscurity. But arguing against the continued existence of this music is like saying they shouldn't make new kinds of beer. Why limit the production of what is, first and foremost, a populist pleasure producer, even if the variation among new products is minimal?After all, the exact right combination of simple, chunky chords required to create The Perfect Rock Song That Makes All Other Rock Songs Irrelevant has not yet been achieved. Surely, this is what has motivated Chuck Betz, Ryan Naideau, and Jimmy Shelton as they've played and recorded as Nude Beach for the past four years. II is a record created with the belief that a trebly guitar riff, a no-bullshit drum beat, and a heart-melting chorus can still rip out the hearts of hopeless romantics young and old. Thankfully, Nude Beach are skilled enough as songwriters and unskilled enough as musicians to re-affirm this belief yet again.II came very close to being one of those highly enjoyable power-pop records that end up locked inside some local scene somewhere. It was the latest in a series of self-released records distributed by the band on cassette and vinyl at shows in and around Brooklyn. Nude Beach's profile was raised this past spring during a tour with the Men, and after the initial pressing of 500 copies was sold out, Other Music Recording Co. stepped up to give II a wider release.Those who picked up II after catching Nude Beach in concert were rewarded with a record that faithfully preserves the group's unpretentious bar-band charms. While Nude Beach self-identify as punks, II is more akin to pub rock, the roots-driven movement that pre-dated the Sex Pistols in mid-70s England. Elvis Costello had connections to that scene, and My Aim Is True is an obvious touchstone for II-- particularly ""Keep It Cool"" and the beery bear-hug that is ""Cathedral Echoes""-- but Nude Beach don't aspire to Costello's erudite lyricism or furious posturing. This is good-time, forget-your-troubles music whose primary subject is the pure, uncut joy it inspires. The album-opening ""Radio"" is made for the very thing the title references, barreling forward with an enthusiasm ideal for car stereos and rolled-down windows. ""You Make It So Easy"" is an affecting slow-dance number conjuring the memory of a million other slow dances, both real and imagined. ""Love Can't Wait"" is the scrappy Tom Petty knock-off, delivered with enough affection and endearing awkwardness to make the thievery not only forgivable, but almost heroic.The only knock on II, again, is that this kind of record is like the city bus, and there's likely another carrier of endearingly disheveled hooks already looming around the corner. As likeable as the album is, there's no saying it won't get out-maneuvered by the next garage band that bashes out a half-hour of blue-denim melodies. What Nude Beach have on their side is songwriting ability and an unshakeable work ethic. That scrappy corner-tavern rock record coming on the horizon might very well be made by them, too."

So far in 2012, the two best examples come from opposite ends of the world: The fine Leaving Atlanta by Georgian tunesmith Gentleman Jesse, and the spirit-lifting self-titled debut by Australia's Royal Headache. You know the reference points for this music: mid-period Replacements, early Elvis Costello, all-eras Tom Petty. These records exist at the intersection of middle-American punk and heartland classic rock. No matter what is happening in the rest of the world musically, there are always people-- mainly young, scruffy-haired white guys, though women sometimes get in on the act, too-- who write snappy, no-frills three-minute pop-rock songs, and then package them into 10-song, 30-minute records. It has nothing to do with being fashionable. Certainly, the world doesn't necessarily ""need"" more records like this, which is why they eventually tend to languish in record-collector obscurity. But arguing against the continued existence of this music is like saying they shouldn't make new kinds of beer. Why limit the production of what is, first and foremost, a populist pleasure producer, even if the variation among new products is minimal?After all, the exact right combination of simple, chunky chords required to create The Perfect Rock Song That Makes All Other Rock Songs Irrelevant has not yet been achieved. Surely, this is what has motivated Chuck Betz, Ryan Naideau, and Jimmy Shelton as they've played and recorded as Nude Beach for the past four years. II is a record created with the belief that a trebly guitar riff, a no-bullshit drum beat, and a heart-melting chorus can still rip out the hearts of hopeless romantics young and old. Thankfully, Nude Beach are skilled enough as songwriters and unskilled enough as musicians to re-affirm this belief yet again.II came very close to being one of those highly enjoyable power-pop records that end up locked inside some local scene somewhere. It was the latest in a series of self-released records distributed by the band on cassette and vinyl at shows in and around Brooklyn. Nude Beach's profile was raised this past spring during a tour with the Men, and after the initial pressing of 500 copies was sold out, Other Music Recording Co. stepped up to give II a wider release.Those who picked up II after catching Nude Beach in concert were rewarded with a record that faithfully preserves the group's unpretentious bar-band charms. While Nude Beach self-identify as punks, II is more akin to pub rock, the roots-driven movement that pre-dated the Sex Pistols in mid-70s England. Elvis Costello had connections to that scene, and My Aim Is True is an obvious touchstone for II-- particularly ""Keep It Cool"" and the beery bear-hug that is ""Cathedral Echoes""-- but Nude Beach don't aspire to Costello's erudite lyricism or furious posturing. This is good-time, forget-your-troubles music whose primary subject is the pure, uncut joy it inspires. The album-opening ""Radio"" is made for the very thing the title references, barreling forward with an enthusiasm ideal for car stereos and rolled-down windows. ""You Make It So Easy"" is an affecting slow-dance number conjuring the memory of a million other slow dances, both real and imagined. ""Love Can't Wait"" is the scrappy Tom Petty knock-off, delivered with enough affection and endearing awkwardness to make the thievery not only forgivable, but almost heroic.The only knock on II, again, is that this kind of record is like the city bus, and there's likely another carrier of endearingly disheveled hooks already looming around the corner. As likeable as the album is, there's no saying it won't get out-maneuvered by the next garage band that bashes out a half-hour of blue-denim melodies. What Nude Beach have on their side is songwriting ability and an unshakeable work ethic. That scrappy corner-tavern rock record coming on the horizon might very well be made by them, too."

Normally a hiatus that long indicates a need to reform, retool, or in some way restart. But apparently this New York trio just gestated, growing their music into something wider, thicker, and harder to define. In huge jams that soar, crash, and smolder-- often at the same time-- the band pumps extra blood and muscle into their sound, as if stretching a balloon into a blimp.If you're familiar with Gamelan, you might wonder how the Psychic Paramount could make their sound any bigger; their crunchy noise and rumbling rhythms already filled speakers. On the surface, II is actually pretty close to Gamelan, at least in volume. But the way it plays out is more widescreen, more 3-D. The songs encompass more moods and tempos, more shifts and builds, more ideas and moves. And the rippling guitars, cloudy bass, and exploding drums create sonic lava that coats the stereo space.Given that scope, it makes sense that the Psychic Paramount have been called post-rock. (The same tag was laid on the band that guitarist Drew St. Ivany and bassist Ben Armstrong previously inhabited, Laddio Bolocko.) After all, they're instrumental and they like to build to crescendos. But where most post-rock bands rely on quiet/loud shifts to create dynamics, these three manage to ebb and flow while sticking to a maxed-energy attack. So while they may ascend at one point and descend at another, they never sound like they're retreating.Which puts II closer to the relentless psych-noise of Japanese bands like Fushitsusha and Marble Sheep than the cine-drama of Godspeed You! Black Emperor or Mogwai. It also has the bluesy immolation of Comets on Fire and the hammering weight of Lightning Bolt, but the impressive thing about II compared to all of these groups-- even compared to Gamelan-- is how controlled and confident it sounds. It's as if they decided to make fire by patiently rubbing sticks rather than violently striking a match. And just as Glenn Branca forged an Ascension by pounding at one chord, the Psychic Paramount find fuel by drilling to the bottom of single riffs.They can get complex, too-- songs like the chopping ""RW"" and jazzy closer ""N5 Coda"" share a math rock vibe with Don Caballero and Oxes. But they're rarely just connecting dots. They're more interested in following intuition than patterns, and II is way more physical than mental. Its density, pace, and exuberance are, for anyone that likes to get lost in sound, basically a sonic amusement park. Still, even if you can close your eyes on this roller coaster*,* you can't turn off your brain. In fact, the way the Psychic Paramount infiltrate your ears, they're more likely to switch that particular organ into overdrive."

But traditional pop music lingo never got around to anticipating the downtempo, prog-infused strain of house music that eventually became generally known as space disco. At its best, it's music that throws you off by how calm and airy it feels on the surface, and right when you're about to be lulled halfway to inattention, the rhythms start to build on top of each other and the melodies start seeping into the forefront and you're hooked. You have Norwegian producer, studio wizard, and multi-instrumentalist Hans-Peter Lindstrøm to thank for helping space disco evolve into its current 21st century incarnation, and countryman Thomas Moen Hermansen (aka Prins Thomas) to thank for giving it a serious foothold by joining Lindstrøm on their first, self-titled collaborative album in 2005. After the two producers crafted some of their finest work last year-- the epic Where You Go I Go Too for Lindstrøm; a host of top-shelf remixes for Thomas (including a staggering reworking of City Reverb's ""City of Lights"")-- the timing's right for a full-length return to their partnership, even if they have some triumphant recent history shadowing them.Fortunately, II isn't a letdown-- assuming you don't count its lack of immediacy as a disappointment. On the first Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas album, eight out of 13 tracks ran less than six minutes, and most of them gave you a pretty good idea of where they were going right away. Here, only one of the eight songs clocks in under seven-and-a-half, and the standard structure relies on slow-build compositions that stretch out, decompress, and mutate; they don't so much segue from track to track as they melt into each other. And while it might feel a little like a marathon anywhere other than the dancefloor, there's more than enough going on over the course of a track-- instruments warping themselves into new beats, new riffs, and new melodies-- to give it a certain dynamism. Listen to a song as a whole, and it'll sound like a gradual ramping-up from a simple theme into a jammy, psychedelic expansion; listen to it again and zero in on just the percussion or keyboards or guitar and that experience will be brought into a vivid, deep focus. But it still works in a way that never really overwhelms the song's driving rhythmic backbone-- light as some of it may feel, it's still dance music.The first four tracks on II are more than vivid enough to draw the first-time listener in, even if they defy easy description. Opener ""Cisco"" is the track that has some people dubbing this L&PT's ""rock"" move, but its multi-tracked guitars chime and twang over a bongo-accented funk groove with a tone that's about as close to the Alan Parsons Project as Chic were. By the time it hits its full stride halfway through, drenched in towering synthesizers and phase-shifted fuzztones, it's a sturdy embodiment of what makes both producers such kitchen-sink auteurs. That momentum continues over the next few tracks, whirring like an irregularly-orbiting satellite around hyper-dense drums and Moroder/Vangelis atmosphere in ""Rothaus"", trembling and then briskly trotting beneath the wintry, shapeshifting piano theme in ""For Ett Slikk Og Ingenting"", and loosening its joints for the crackling energy of the shifty ""Rett På"", the most tightly-packed song on the record; it sounds like there's about a half-dozen different rhythmic ideas going on at once there, and they all somehow manage to sync.The last four tracks are a little less frenetic, if no less involved. The final two in particular-- ""Note I Love You + 100"" and ""Flue På Veggen""-- are more than  24 minutes combined, and they both hit an interesting nerve of cross-era aesthetics, particularly in how the former features a mid-70s Fender Rhodes that slowly liquefies into a burbling new-wave synth, and the latter fuses a disco drum machine with haywire analog burbles, wordless vocal melodies, and crystalline chimes. You can kind of imagine the ingredients for this album coming from a number of different sources-- prog rock, krautrock, disco, funk, MOR pop, maybe even some folk here and there-- but at this point there's just so much potential influence it's hard not to hear the whole instead. And it's a hell of a lot of whole, too: It's mellow and smooth and relaxing, sure, but it's also unpredictable and full of little revelations and turns of sound that make it one of space disco's crowning recent achievements. If Lindstrøm and Thomas ever drop a III on us, it'll have a lot to live up to."

On such albums as You Walk Alone and On the Way, the music skirted so closely to recognizable blues-rock forms that Corwood connoisseurs have long speculated that another unknown guitarist joined Jandek. And though Brussels-based artist Bram Devens is far too young and Belgian to be seriously considered as a candidate, with his ongoing solo project Ignatz he has proven to be veritably Jandekian in his ability to retreat into his own private, transfixing musical universe.The original Ignatz, of course, appeared in George Herriman's classic comic strip Krazy Kat. Krazy Kat loves Ignatz Mouse, who enjoys throwing bricks at Krazy. Meanwhile, Offisa Pup is himself in love with Krazy, and spends his time trying to prevent the inevitable brick-beaning. And so it continued in Herriman's daily strip, in limitless variation, for more than 30 years. Using only a deliberately lo-fi arsenal of guitar, FX pedals and samplers, Devens is able to approximate something of Krazy Kat's captivating simplicity, repetition and symmetry. His improvised work draws heavily on Appalachian folk and bluegrass-- as well as on the hypnotic electric-blues of performers like Mississippi John Hurt-- but invariably continues his travels out into the alien wilderness.True to its title, Ignatz II is a genuine sequel, following Devens' debut by a matter of months. (Deven's numbering system apparently doesn't take into account last year's CD-R release I Will Soothe My Eye To Feast It With A Sight Of Beauty). For this album, Devens moves his sound in a marginally more song-oriented direction, even delivering one acoustic track free from any disorienting effects. More typical, however, are such songs as the opening ""He Deals With Love & Her Eyes Glaze"", which buries Ignatz's blue notes beneath a moving carpet of spectral echoes and figures that dart like unearthly fireflies through the darkness.At its essence, folk music concerns itself with memory. Its techniques, themes, and narratives are passed down hand-to-hand, so that the ghosts of the past might be granted admittance to the present. On Ignatz II, Devens translates this remembrance into his own uniquely scrambled vocabulary. The delicate Ben Chasny-like picking of ""I Was Not There"" gives way to the turbulent space-blues of ""The Dreams"", whose central riff eventually crumbles into an acrid cloud of amp distortion. The garbled repetitions of ""Silver Moon... Shine Sun! Sun! Sun!"" call to mind the hypnotic modal blues drones of Junior Kimbrough, while the ethereal ""Hurling Incense"" shimmers in blank space like a single, perfectly sustained harp note.Devens sings and/or speaks on several of these tracks, but he chooses not to duplicate the strangely high-pitched vocals that graced his debut. On ""She Will Freeze"" and the set-closing blues shuffle ""All Your Love"", his voice could almost be that of a standard folk troubadour, chanting his impassioned mantras of faith and devotion from behind the crackled veil of a prewar blues 78. But as Ignatz II again demonstrates, Devens has proven regularly able to re-interpret these borrowed texts in his own singular fashion, his handmade bricks again gloriously shaped, baked, and thrown."

For the most part, freak-folk tends to eschew any clear genre parameters, but its participants-- willing or not-- are still blissfully united in an eyes-closed, drifting-to-the-strums adoration of ancient British folk tradition, while routinely pilfering from late-1960s/early-1970s folk-rock heroes Fairport Convention, Vashti Bunyan, Shirley Collins, the Strawbs, Pentangle, Comus, the Incredible String Band, and more. The hippie-gone-Renaissance Faire overtones might be distracting to those less-inclined to gnawing turkey legs while draped in beads, but Espers' intricate, vaguely menacing folk songs are smarter, sharper, and more relentlessly compelling than their trappings might suggest.Espers is now a sextet, and II is far darker, deeper, and more ominous than its predecessors, a rich, droning mix of guitars, vocals slathered on vocals, cello, assorted bells, flute, recorder, mini-Korg, Tibetan singing bowls, dulcimer, a bit of bass, organ, the occasional drum, and a cornucopia of effects. The pretty haze that clouded earlier efforts is mostly lifted-- II is muscular throughout. Opener ""Dead Queen"" slowly builds, oozing sideways from an acoustic guitar riff that sounds half-lifted from ""Stairway to Heaven"", while Meg Baird and Brook Sietinsons coo in harmony, voices precise, inviting dancing bits of drone and effects-laden squeals into the song. ""Mansfield and Cyclops"" (Espers' song titles do little to alleviate their barefoot-in-the-woods reputation) is driving despite its relative quietude. ""Moon Occults the Sun"", which closes the record, sees Greg Weeks howling like Thom Yorke, his pipes beautifully unhinged and in tight contrast to taut drums and guitar.II is a perfectly balanced record, and its arrangements are so exact and delicate that it almost feels like one buzz of a doorbell or ring of a telephone could send the whole thing toppling over, splattering into useless bits. Somehow, Espers manage to expertly capture the menace so inherent to Celtic folksinging, harnessing the same rhythms and pieces of syntax that infiltrated the Appalachians in the early 18th century, and translate that threat into a distinctly American noise. And, like any good folk outfit, old or new, Espers are preoccupied with story: Here, the songs are long and the lyrics are difficult to discern, but there's a hazy narrative in place that makes II extraordinarily difficult to listen to in pieces. There's an end to this tale, and you'll find yourself craving the closure."

Appetit!, was the first post-Scissor Girls offering from AZ ...","Bride of No No's first album, B.O.N.N. Appetit!, was the first post-Scissor Girls offering from AZ (also known as Azita Youssefi), and offered a restrained and refined take on the jagged and frayed chaos the Girls were best known for. This current offering, the second and final Bride of No No record, comes on the heels of Azita's newest record, Enantiodromia, and offers even more refinement, owing more to the laidback acerbic cool of Steely Dan than the scatological indignation of The Fall. Knowing that II was actually produced between B.O.N.N. Appetit! and Azita's newest album, it's not surprising to learn that it serves as a bridge between the Bride's loose interpretation of rock and Azita's Bowie-esque balladry.My first impressions of the record made me think this was a bridge best left burned. The music sounded stiff and inept. Azita's singing, already something of an acquired taste, sounded particularly wretched, her atonal cawing and yawping more affected than affecting. And the addition of a piano to certain tracks brought to mind unflattering, cacophonous thoughts of B.O.N.N. Appetit! and Enantiodromia playing simultaneously at unbearable volumes.A track like ""Slugville"" was a prime offender in this regard-- it starts with some distorted guitar, and then begins to shamble along, with some piano along for the halting ride. After two minutes of stumbling, the song switches gears, grinding against itself before going for a brief jaunt, and then concluding with a reprisal of the introductory shamble. And, of course, there's Azita, mewling about the best show on earth being free or some such nonsense. It sounded awful, chaotic in the worst possible way, ill-formed and misbegotten.But then I gave it another listen. I noticed how the instrumentation, for all its shoddiness and seeming ineptitude, stayed steady, established a pattern, propelled this sluggish song. In fact, all the elements of the song-- the lazy leaden guitar soloing, the drunken piano, the stumblebum drums-- act like things you'd hear in an ordinary blues lament. In this light, the piano I heard as superfluous and distracting actually lends this thudding track some necessary buoyancy, and also anchors the tempo changes.If you can listen past some cosmetic ugliness, there's plenty of other rewards to be found on this album. ""Proven Formula"" doesn't actually offer one, but instead gives you three songs within its five minute frame. ""Wait a Min"" is the closest this record comes to conventionally rocking out, though it's still not all that conventional. The ten minutes of ""Piano One"" switch between tortured piano-led ruminations and the Bride's particular brand of rock (discordant, haphazard, abrasive) in the service of telling a not-so-simple story-- ""It's all right that you go/ I would follow... Watch as the film runs slo-mo/ To catch a bigger man than you or I/ To be the bigger man than you'd like."" And, in case you're hankering for something that's readily accessible, the 3\xBD minutes of ""Piano Intro"" are without a doubt the most beautiful moments this record has to offer. For the folks out there willing to work and give this record a chance, it's a just reward."

Sometimes, letting go is the easiest way to get your grip, and as any traveler will tell you, getting there is almost all of the fun. Get it? Unless you're completely wasted, probably not-- this is the crux of stoner wisdom, wherein often you're the only one who knows that you're right. Maybe that's why music made under these circumstances is usually so out there. It probably made sense at the time for Tim Leary and Manuel Gottsching to make all those strange sounds, but to the indifferent observer they are something else altogether. This isn't to say chemically enhanced music only makes sense to the tuned in and turned on, but I'd argue it's probably much easier to find common ground when you're high.Enter Finland's Pharaoh Overlord, a project led by guitarist Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle, themselves good for a lengthy excursion or three into outer space. The flavor on their second release is decidedly passive where Circle are prone to brute force. Rather than concoct trance via mere repetition, Pharaoh Overlord realize that the quickest way to a sedated heart is to ease in gradually, massaging all the rough edges away and keeping the traveler effortlessly afloat. Fuck, more herb nonsense-- anyway, you probably get the idea. If not, may I suggest that these guys come off like an intensely comfortable version of Acid Mothers Temple, minus all that guitar squealing nonsense. For the straight-edgers in the audience, just consider it the next best thing to warm milk before bed.""Komaron Runner"" wastes little time establishing the mildly disorientating quease-trance that Pharaoh Overlord specialize in. A gauze of distant, howling breeze covers the minimal guitar-bass-drums vamp like a layer of heavy white smoke. The sound approaches lo-fi even as the layers of soft noise build, giving the tune an ominous, hazy depth. The band play everything pretty slow, and prefer extremely minor variations on the same basic riff played continuously, rather than muck up the mix with extraneous ""psychedelic"" effects (Cotton Casino, I'm looking in your direction). Likewise, ""Dark Temper"" wrings plenty of mileage out of its snaky, pseudo-blues thang using little more than that same smoggy veneer and surprisingly subtle guitar figures. The end result is like a younger cousin to Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" crossed with Funkadelic's ""Music for Your Mother"", but with no vocals, you're free to follow your own narrative.Slightly less engaging is ""Skyline"", if only because it tends to follow the more obvious path to bliss via mind-numbing repetition. There's a good chance you'll have the main riff from this tune permanently ingrained after hearing it a few times-- whether or not that translates to ever wanting to play it again depends on your affinity for pre-school blues riffery (and general level of patience). ""August"" and ""Love Unfiltered"" opt for acoustic textures, though not at the expense of the already well-stated preference for sludgy garage rock grooves. The former tune is almost folky, with a dual finger picked guitar attack, good for back porch revelations on a dead-hot summer evening. The latter is more overtly spacey, though in truth, the differences between these two songs (and much of the album) might well come down to how willing you are to be hypnotized: waiting for ""something"" to happen is probably beside the point.II won't change the face of rock, or even psyche-rock. There are literally hundreds of albums from the late 60s and early 70s out there that will do a similar trick, though I suppose if you aren't willing to scour eBay like greasy collector scum, Pharaoh Overlord can provide a valuable service at a fraction of the price. Like any decent trip, this music will serve you best when you've cleared your mind, sat back and accepted that you aren't going anywhere beyond the bizarre corridors of your mind. Motherfucker, I just lapsed into that shit again! Anyway...you know what I'm talkin' about, man."

Everything else-- from sadness or humor, to apathy or longing-- falls somewhere between. It is a broad, canyonesque continuum, spanning genres as diverse as black metal, slow-core, space-funk, post-punk, and many others. But alas, there a few limited avenues of expression which find themselves on an entirely different plane, excluded from this continuum of toleration. One of them is cuteness.Palomar is cute. Not perpetually cute, thank god, but in spurts, Palomar are Nermal to my Garfield-- almost intolerable, and a major hurdle toward my enjoyment of the album-- or most adults', for that matter. The basic cuteness construct Palomar employs here is a spin on pop/punk, with a heavy emphasis on the 'pop' part, and the 'spin' displaying all of the symptoms of an indie-polka. The polka-line isn't just a toss-off critique, either; tunes like ""Knockout"" or the beginning of ""Lesion"" had me tasting pierogies.None of this is to say that Palomar aren't talented. Quite the contrary-- wade your way through the Hello Kitty delivery and you have a good slab of catchy, competent songwriting. One of the band's talents is orchestrating spunky, energetic vocal melodies. It sounds like at least three, if not all four band members, chip in once in a while to sing lead, enrich choruses, add counterpoint, or complete a four-part harmony. Tonally, the band remains fairly consistent, with treble-heavy bass, two guitars (one with a warm electric tone, the other overdriven), and a nasal vocal lead.The music itself is nowhere near as stagnant as most pop-punk, though, as Palomar sensibly modulates tempo and intensity, like on ""Evening Falls at the Buffalo Bar,"" which shifts from a slow, one-horse trot to a full-band gallop. ""Up!,"" featuring two guys from the Strokes (!) on background vocals (not Julian), builds through a standard punk verse to a super-catchy Grease-like theatrical chorus and denouement.Demographics are probably about as much of a concern for Palomar as an arena tour. But supposing this band had thought about demographics, it would be plainly evident that they'd reached some sort of consensus about females under the age of 22. I say this because Palomar plays fun, youthful music-- the kind of stuff you'd expect your 16-year-old girlfriend to put on a summertime mixdisc (your 16-year-old girlfriend-- mine is 17, thanks very much).The youngsters will probably enjoy this record most, but this doesn't mean you won't, too (provided you're over 22). If you have the stomach for a cute, carnival-fun atmosphere, Palomar just may be your very own orgasmic version of Whack-A-Mole. If you don't, then the Tilt-a-Whirl may be a better analogy, with this review playing the part of 'ominous wafting barf aroma.'"

There are so many different folk styles out there that it would be hard to hear a glimpse of them all, but basically everything is on record somewhere, from Indonesian gamelan orchestras to Hungarian wedding dances and Delta blues.The end result of all this mixing and cultural exchange is recombination, a trend led largely by the pop world, whether it's George Harrison arranging rock songs for the sitar or the Squirrel Nut Zippers mixing up a tossed salad of klezmer and 20's hot jazz. Of course, it's hard for artists in these early stages of grafting styles to avoid boring genre exercises and clumsy failed experiments, but often you'll end wind up with fairly transcendent results; witness the Police's fusion of reggae and new wave.Idyll Swords are just the latest in a long line of bands who set out to bring disparate styles together, and you have to admire them for their sheer ambition. Unfortunately, on this, their second album, their reach sometimes exceeds their grasp as they simply try to bring too many sounds under the same roof without first trying to figure out a way to combine them. At times, the North Carolina trio's sophomore effort feels like a demonstration tape of various folk styles from around the world, with genre exercises from Central Asia sitting rather uncomfortably next to a study on something from Eastern Europe.That's not to say there aren't some truly outstanding moments here. The three musicians, Chuck Johnson, Grant Tennille, and ex-Polvo guitarist Dave Brylawski, are all guitarists at heart, but on II, they tackle a wide variety of stringed instruments from around the world with admirable facility. They open the record on a deceptively dark note, with the ominous riff that announces ""Tantz,"" but quickly allow it to subside in favor of field recordings and a triple acoustic guitar piece. The guitar piece flows through multiple movements, some full of frenzied rhythms and interlocking ostinatos, others brimming with melodic grace.""Lake Palace"" follows, offering one of the album's only two vocal selections. It's quite pleasant, calling upon Appalachian folk for inspiration before landing in slower territory akin to the British folk of the late 60's, as practiced by Steeleye Span. It also lasts well over eight minutes, sadly overstaying its welcome by a few minutes. ""Eschuteon Ascent/Biza's Theme"" makes a natural union of guitars and Eastern strings before descending into a soup of field recordings and audio editing that would fit nicely onto an Olivia Tremor Control album."

He simulated masturbation, shattered car windows with crowbars, and unleashed the primal screams expected from a man who owned publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue. Then he turned into a black panther. The video ends with Bart Simpson striking a B-Boy pose in a Michael Jackson shirt, and ordering Homer to “chill out, homeboy.” It shattered all previous viewing records on Fox.The $4 million, 11-minute unedited telecast of “Black or White” ranks among the Smithsonian-worthy artifacts of ’90s pop monoculture—up there with Nirvana trashing their instruments at the ’92 VMAs, the premiere of “Summertime” after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Hillary Clinton hitting the Macarena at the ’96 DNC. No one ever had more juice than Jackson did at the time, and it’s difficult to imagine that anyone ever will again.This was right around the time when they named him an official king of the Ivory Coast. In Gabon, 100,000 greeted him with signs reading “Welcome Home, Michael.” His universal popularity was on par with pizza and the polio vaccine. Safe enough to be Captain EO at Disneyland, hood-certified enough to throw up the set with the Crips.The 33-year-old had recently signed the most lucrative contract in recording history, worth hundreds of millions, giving him his own label and the highest royalty rate in the industry. What’s more, no one thought it was out of line for someone who had sold close to 70 million records in the previous decade. In the press, Sony claimed the deal would reap them billions.So when he released the first single from Dangerous, his first album in four years, fanatical interest led MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox to televise it at the same time—offering the greatest strategic victory since the Berlin Wall tumbled two years prior. And even though Jackson technically didn’t cause the collapse of East German Communism, his star wattage was so supreme that the Stasi secret police spied on him during his 1988 Berlin concert, fearing that obsessive MJ fans would accomplish what Reagan couldn’t.With “Black or White,” Jackson lashed out at his public perception. In the interim since 1987’s Bad, he’d grappled with both outlandish rumors (buying the Elephant Man’s bones, sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber) and some that drew blood (allegations of bleaching his skin). The innocent popcorn-eating Michael of Thriller was gone, but calling him “Wacko Jacko” was slander. He wanted us to know he was a man, an eccentric sure, but an adult with deeply rooted beliefs."

The second LP from UK-based singer and producer Daniel Woolhouse, Songs isn't quite the folksy confessional its title implies. This isn't Songs of Daniel Woolhouse; you won't find a ""So Long, Marianne"" in its ranks. Instead, Songs—maybe titled so simply as recompense for last year's punny *Life After Defo—*winds in tender and occasionally cathartic circles, focusing on the fears that accompany an intimacy that's supposed to be permanent.I mean, how do pessimists pair off? How do you put down your melancholy long enough to say, ""Hey, we'll probably like each other forever""? And once loneliness is legally written out of your record, where do you put the sadness that mysteriously hasn't vanished now that you sleep next to the same person every night? Woolhouse's Songs circles through these problems of commitment as he tries to situate himself as one half of a stable whole.""Every new day you can set on fire everything that you own,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". He can build a house, he knows, but not one that won't burn. This is a guy who's clearly in love and still can't help being a downer. ""I fell down/ Things all look bad to me,"" he sings on ""We Symbolise"". ""Love stings, everything goes,"" he muses on ""The Lovers"". What's more, he's got to weigh in his headspace with another person every day of his life. If there's danger, it's shared, for good or bad: ""I saw the weight in your eye in the corner of the night."" In marriage you get to be loved, but you also have to be constantly seen.Behind his accented murmurs, Woolhouse fills out Songs with bolder strokes than the pale production of Life After Defo. His synthesized instruments all sound synthesized— strings, drums, flutes, and horns plop directly out of a keyboard, and he does nothing to obscure it or make any stab at realism. Acoustic instruments would have projected a sense of collaboration, of others sharing a room and playing with him. Surrounded by fakes, Woolhouse sounds completely alone.It's there in his solitude that he can get at the roots of his worries. Woolhouse knows that for some of us, getting what you've always wanted prompts the question of whether or not you're even worthy of it in the first place. Throughout Songs, he yearns to be better—to be the sort of guy who deserves the love he wants. ""Make me good,"" he pleads on the beautifully revolving ""Near to a River"". ""Make me kind. Lift my body up. Make me kind."" He repeats the words like a mantra as the song overflows, carrying him away on its surf.Even within the safety of companionship, the outside world threatens danger. ""Find each other, cause it's all we've got,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". When he gets far enough outside of his own head, his expressions of love are charmingly simple: ""You're a human, and I like you the best."" That's it. That's all there is. He cuts out the sparkle from romance, knowing that it alone won't save him. But that doesn't mean he can't take root in it, can't wear it like armor. ""We've got peace in us,"" he concludes on ""Two Hearts"", the first in the album's delicate two-song finish. ""Love, love is enough."" Then, on ""A Shelter, a Weapon"": ""If you want me, you can have me 'til the end of time."" There's no guarantee anything lasts that long, but he's willing to fight for something like forever."

After a few years of letting that low end ride on UK dubstep labels like Dub Police and Sub Soldiers, Leeds-hailing first-wave wobbler Rusko released his debut LP, the intermittently interesting crossover attempt O.M.G.!, in May of 2010. Another, more culturally resonant bass-heavy release emerged that year: Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, the breakout second EP from the ever-polarizing skronkmeister and recent triple-Grammy winner Skrillex. By the end of the year, Rusko was not only castigating the absurdly named ""brostep"" sub-genre affixed to artists like him and Skrillex-- he was taking responsibility for the whole thing. ""Brostep is my fault, but now I've started to hate it, in a way,"" he told BBC 1Xtra DJ MistaJam. ""I kind of took it there, and now everybody else is taking it too far."" A year later and he was still on one, telling SPIN that the follow-up to O.M.G.! would be ""a reaction to the masculine, dance-floor orientated, distorted mess that is the current state of dubstep.""Really, it's strange Rusko was stuck with the ""brostep"" tag to begin with: The closest association he has with Alpha Wub Delta types is the liberal sampling of dialogue from Guy Ritchie's rough-and-tumble frat-arthouse touchstone Snatch found on his and dubstep mainstay Caspa's 2007 Fabriclive mix. He is more than familiar with letting that bass run wild, albeit in less aggressive ways than his HARD Fest contemporaries-- but you either have to be narrow-minded or just plain ignorant of dance culture as a whole to think that rocking a system with cavernous rumble is a new thing.All of which is to say Rusko's sour-grapes exhortations were probably a tad reactionary, the type of thing you might expect from a guy who recently threatened to leak his own record after his label, Mad Decent, arranged for a now-industry-standard online stream of it a few weeks before its release. Either way, we win, since on this sophomore LP, he's made some seriously twisted hooch from that puckered vine: A five-mile sprint away from easy categorization, Songs is a nasty carnival of electronic pop that giddily hops between styles-- jungle, rave, dub, purple, reggae, pure Guetta-fied pop, and so on-- like a broken radio. The nondescript album title refers to Rusko's nearly exclusive focus on vocal-heavy cuts, following O.M.G.!'s track-y vibe. There's a lot of toasting and wailing alike on this record, even if the former edges out the latter in terms of consistency."

Rihanna and Ludacris are among the guests.","Clifford Harris has gotten pretty good at this self-fulfilling prophecy thing. Though 2003's Trap Musik made him a regional royal in Atlanta, 2006's King accurately predicted he'd go nationwide. That record, combined with the positive reception of his film ATL the same year, gave hip-hop the legitimate multimedia crossover star it needed as interest in 50 Cent flagged. But his predictive powers worked against him on last year's T.I. vs T.I.P., a sloppy and rushed collection loosely based on the notion that no matter how firmly the rapper entrenched himself in the pop world, anything from his hustler past-- from his hotheadedness to his felonies to his associations-- could compromise his success. Which is exactly what happened: He's now staring down jail time for attempting to purchase machine guns from a federal agent in a Walgreens parking lot.T.I. apparently learned his lesson, and on Paper Trail, he's not taking any chances with an extraneous narrative. Although some recent mixtape tracks suggest we might be getting a 25th Hour-like confessional from Harris on his way to a one-year sentence in 2009 (or reality TV), Paper Trail bases itself on the assumption that everything's going to be all right for him, emotionally and financially. Breaking rank from his previous two efforts by writing down his lyrics again, he immediately shows a willingness to do something other than coast from hook to hook-- at least at the outset, on ""56 Bars (Intro)"" and ""I'm Illy"". Not that he's morphed into Pharoahe Monch or anything: His wordplay likens his weed to celery and his money-getting ability to the U.S. Treasury, which are pretty lame boasts these days.The real shift in tone, though, becomes apparent in T.I.'s eagerness to please: Even with ""Swagga Like Us"", Paper Trail hosts as many obligatory guest R&B hookmen as rappers. The conciliatory lover's rock of ""Whatever You Like"", with its near-absence of rapping, spotlights a synth pluck as flirty and debauched as a coked-up celebutante as proof that this ""Lollipop"" thing is a full-blown trend, not just a one-off WTF. And despite T.I. making an uncomfortable number of veiled threats to bloggers, Just Blaze goes all Rivers Cuomo by cratedigging in YouTube; the internet-approved ""Numa Numa"" song is now a hook via Rihanna at her most robo. (The song bottoms out on listenability even before you get to the surprisingly unctuous moralizing of its second verse.) And if you justifiably figured ""Porn Star"" would be the album's low point, wait til Tip stoops to using a ""life is like a..."" device so cornball that even Travis beat him to it."

The camera phone clip shows Beyoncé rehearsing her new album's opening eternal-love ballad, ""1+1"", backstage at ""American Idol"". There she is: eyes shut, standing in front of a mirror, singing her guts out while family and friends look on in quiet awe. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's ""Take Away Show"", its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. ""Help me let down my guard,"" she belts. And, as Beyoncé finishes the song, you hear her proud husband let out a joyous ""woo!"" It's all quite endearing and personal-- two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple. ""Sometimes you need perspective,"" wrote Jay in an intro to the video on his Life + Times website. ""You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time.""It's a fitting sentiment and song to introduce 4, which largely deals with monogamy and all that comes with committing to one person for a potential lifetime. Which, like a bad marriage, might sound boring, repetitive, staid. But, in Beyoncé's more-than-capable and still-in-love hands, a relationship that lasts can seem as complicated and rewarding as anyone would hope. ""If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn/ 'Cause I got it with you,"" she testifies on ""1+1""-- potentially dubious words from a woman who certainly has ""something,"" but her mainlined vocals quickly dismiss mere logistics. The song boasts some of her finest-ever singing laid over a bed of warm and flowing synths, strings, and bass that manages to connect the dots between Sam Cooke and Prince without sacrificing any Beyoncé-ness. ""1+1"" is that rare wonder: a wedding song that pleases but doesn't pander.The only recent pop ballad that comes close to its power is Adele's stunning ""Someone Like You"". But where that song-- and its massively successful corresponding album, 21-- wrung out the aftermath of young heartbreak, Beyoncé is aiming for something a bit more challenging with 4: love the one you're with, and have some fun doing it, too. The album's relative riskiness extends to its music, which side-steps Top 40 radio's current Eurobeat fixation for a refreshingly eclectic mix of early-90s R&B, 80s lite soul, and brass'n'percussion-heavy marching music. All of the album's best elements, thematically and sonically, burst ahead on Jay-Z ode ""Countdown"", a honking, stutter-step sequel of sorts to ""Crazy in Love"". The new track makes 10 years of loyalty seem just as thrilling as the first time, with Beyoncé offering her partner copious praise in that famed half-rap cadence: ""Still love the way he talks/ Still love the way I sing/ Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain."""

Turns out they weren't, really, but for someone who doesn't comprehend Swedish that's simply a safety net. The important thing was Ejstes' voice-- a rich, multitracked sharp/sweet melodic hum which could be non-contradictorily described as a ""beautiful whine."" Nobody else in rock sounds like him, and since he's clearly aware of the multilingual nature of his audience-- especially as a musician with an international rolodex of influences and interests himself-- he puts a strong focus on the purely musical aspect of his voice. Understand Swedish, and you get the full meaning; if you don't, you still get caught up in the striking way he draws out all those unfamiliar syllables.Yet that voice had become familiar by 2007's Tio Bitar-- enough that it was easier to catch your breath and cast a slightly more jaded ear towards the formula churning away: bucolic Scandinavian folk, fuzzed-out psych, a bit of bop-jazz elasticity, lots of Keith Moon-ish drum fills, and ringing piano chords. Even then, going from sounding revelatory to sounding reliable isn't exactly falling off, and the music still made it hard to believe that it was put together largely by Ejstes alone in a multi-instrumentalist, producer-assembled capacity informed as much by Pete Rock as Pete Townshend.4 follows Tio Bitar, and while it's clear Ejstes has grown comfortable without getting complacent, he's managed to shake things up for the better this time around. Most notably, there's been a subtle shift to the group's dynamic-- and it is a group this time around. As much as Ejstes' one-man operation's been played up, there's a greater role for other musicians on 4, as Gustav opts to focus primarily on vocals and piano; Reine Fiske reprises his Tio Bitar role providing most of the lead guitar spark, Johan Holmegard takes over behind the drum kit, and touring-band member Mattias Gustavsson holds bass duties. 4 shows this permutation of Dungen to maintain the kind of tautness previous albums have thrived on, the end result of a touring unit assembled and honed to ideally recreate the careful constructions of a stylistically restless auteur in a live setting.The resulting lineup has come up with a tighter, more focused, and more compact record than Tio Bitar (10 songs, 38 minutes, no songs over five minutes) that still finds a way to touch on all of Dungen's sonic tendencies in lively, unpredictable fashion. Moments of mournfully wailing acid-rock beauty (the violin-tinged opener ""Sätt Att Se"") give way to gentler strains of classically influenced pop (""Målerås Finest""). The loose-fingered, high-speed freakout of ""Samtidigt 1"" is joined in progress right after the fluttering pastoralism of ""Det Tar Tid""; its partner ""Samtidigt 2""-- culled from the same full-band jam session-- soars into some kind of Deadhead exosphere only to dissipate into the soft piano/chime/flute melodies of ""Bandhagen"" (and its not-so-soft drumbeat-- like every other Dungen record, 4 is a percussive monster). And sometimes the contrasts build over the course of a single song, like when the jaunty Zombies/Kinks march-beat of ""Finns Det Någon Möjlighet"" eventually shifts from lighthearted, piano-driven frolic to a feedback-drenched trudge through creeping dread.And since the music has a renewed surprise to it, that voice does, too. Even though 4 has a greater emphasis on instrumental compositions that don't suffer much from the absence of Ejstes' vocals, it's a bit of a disappointment that they only show up in half the songs. Especially considering that they're a fine melodic accompaniment to just about anything the musicians are capable of-- crooning Byrds-inflected self-harmonies over the minimalist Motown groove of ""Ingenting År Sig Likt"", for instance, or keening through the Turkish-influenced stomp of ""Mina Damer Och Fasaner"". But even if that voice's an incredible instrument, it's just one piece of what's become an intricate structure."

If discussed at all, mentions barely move beyond standard-issue guitar freak-out metaphors. Worse, the two are spoken of in the past tense. It's particularly surprising that their excellent current project, Major Stars, hasn't noticeably benefited from the renewed interest in Blue Cheer raucousness and distended fret shredding. They did collaborate on Live In Europa, a split LP with Comets on Fire, but otherwise seem to be shuffling along a murky path toward underground respect sans popular recognition.The trip started when Rogers formed Crystallized Movements with drummer Ed Boyden in 1980, while the two were still in high school. Biggar (aka Kate Village) joined Rogers a few years later and ever since the two have created some of the best underground American guitar music of our time while also running run the Cambridge-based Twisted Village label/record store. High points have been Magic Hour (with Galaxie 500's Damon and Naomi as rhythm section) and any number of Rogers' darkly plaintive and wailing solo albums. There are also raw spin-offs like Bongloads of Righteous Boo, Heathen Shame, Vermonster, and Wormdoom.After Damon and Naomi left Magic Hour to focus on their Exact Change literary press and eponymous folk, Rogers and Biggar formed Major Stars with bassist Tom Leonard (aka the equally underrated Luxurious Bags) and drummer Dave Lynch (Vermonster). The new rhythm section offers a heavier center than Damon & Naomi, who stitched a beautifully diaphanous undertow. Until now, the quartet's best effort was 2002's Distant Effects. But 25 years into the game, Rogers and Biggar have here turned out some of their best work yet.With Rogers/Biggar, you rarely get much fanfare: Despite their lavish guitar playing, these folks come off spartan: 4 is their fourth album and it contains four songs. On the other hand, it's also Major Star's first album put to tape in a 24-track studio-- and the increased fidelity is a revelation. When played loud enough, it almost matches the awe-inspiring feeling of their live shows.The session is from July 2003, and boasts phenomenal guitar licks, extended and acrobatic soloing, a dense and smoky (but also chilly and somehow pristine) atmosphere, and Wayne Rogers' shadowy voice, which is best described as deep, inked, and syrupy. It reminds me of constellations seen through dead New England trees. Or if J Mascis were a monk and not a stoner.I'm usually a big stickler for lyrics, but have never paid too much attention to what Rogers' is intoning. In general, what matters more than a libretto is how he breathes and tumbles between the guitars. On ""All Or Half The Time"", he lulls with beautiful melancholia while the guitars provide high-level fireworks. Then comes the alternately lulling/blistering/nimble and everything in between 13-plus minute instrumental ""Song For Turner"", and it's clear why the words don't much matter. Remarkably, unlike Comets On Fire or other band's they've helped spawn, the soloing is never harsh: Even when there's a storm of feedback, it always feels like a pillow.But a pillow proffered doesn't mean you'll sleep. This is the music of revelation and throwing off the sky's geometry; it maintains a heavy feeling of night, but more like sweaty 3 a.m. epiphany. If Kieran Hebden hadn't already grabbed Everything Ecstatic for his new Four Tet offering, the name could've served as the less modest title for this glorious mountain of sky-melting psychedelia. There, I said it."

Today, we revisit Adele’s earth-shattering 2011 album, granting the British torch singer entrée into the pantheon of iconic pop vocalists.","The green room was full of Adeles, nails all long and painted, hairdos puffed into the singer’s signature beehive. The BBC had corralled a cluster of impersonators into an experiment; they thought they were at an audition. But the real Adele was among them, disguised, plastered in a fake nose and chin, joining in on their jokes about how long it was taking her to release a new album.It was 2015, and for years, Adele had been everywhere. Signed to the British label XL at age 18, after a track her friend uploaded to MySpace gained attention, she released her debut album, 19, two years after graduating from the lauded BRIT School. It went triple platinum in the U.S. and catalyzed an almost feverish mass adoration. She pouted on the cover of Vogue, she belted on SNL, she swept the Grammys, she soundtracked James Bond. Adele never seemed to cast herself as an archetypal pop star—in interviews, she was giggly and crass, and often deployed what critics and fans called a “cackle.” In one of the few declarations of her pop supremacy, she held out on releasing her 2015 album, 25, to streaming services, a move then only wielded by artists like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. The gamble worked: People bought her physical records in droves, with such a fervor that some thought maybe Adele had single-handedly saved the industry.While her first album garnered Adele international attention, her 2011 follow-up, 21 catapulted her into the Guinness Book of World Records—21 is reportedly the longest-running No. 1 album by a female solo artist in the history of U.S. and UK charts. The album cemented her legacy as an artist who could make once-in-a-generation milestones out of her music. 21 is filled with colossal songs, elegant and glistening, bending but never breaking under the heft of Adele’s voice, which sounds like Amy Winehouse mashed with opera. (Adele said that she owed “90%” of her career to Amy Winehouse, before a concert on what would have been Winehouse’s 33rd birthday.)Beyond the similarities to Winehouse, though—the gritty, growled vocals that could stretch into big belted notes, often over jazzy piano—Adele seemed like a pop star flung out of social or temporal context. She swirled together soul and pop and jazz; Adele said she turned to country while writing the record. She revered Etta James as a kid. The first concert she went to was the Cure, with her mom, and her cover of “Lovesong” on 21 quivers and crawls, hovers above a scratch, one of the more subdued tracks on the album. “She takes you to places other artists don’t go to anymore—the way they did in the 70s,” Beyoncé said about her. Adele crafted her songs intentionally to be timeless—“I want to sing these songs when I’m 70 fuckin’ years old,” she told Vanity Fair."

The production style originally shaped by MexikoDro, StoopidXool, and the rest of a crew called Beat Pluggz is like Atlanta trap beats merged with Screw music and Zelda OST melodies. It was the foundation of many promising rappers on SoundCloud in the mid-2010s, including UnoTheActivist, Thouxanbanfauni, Yung Bans, and, most famously, Playboi Carti. But a wave of “type beats” producers oversaturated the sound with half-assed imitations. Soon enough, it felt like everyone with a SoundCloud account had adopted the form, and by the time Carti put out his heavily anticipated 2017 debut mixtape, he’d left it behind. Plugg music was then unfairly written off as underground and played out until recently when a new wave of rappers and producers who never stopped loving it emerged.But Ka$hdami is also strongly influenced by his home base in the DMV. Since the 16-year-old’s voice became deeper about a year ago, he no longer sounds like he should be waving a wand on the Disney Channel. With his latest mixtape epiphany, he leans into the gruff flows and gun-toting punchlines delivered with a wink by regional staples like Xanman, Q Da Fool, Lil Dude, and Goonew. On “Look N the Mirror!”—Ka$hdami’s breakout single and the heart of the record—he aggressively raps, “I ain’t the same lil’ nigga from the block/It’s a one way, nigga, come down, get shot/Boy, you had the drop for a motherfuckin’ year/Without your niggas, you gon’ disappear,” over a lush plugg beat. Typically, in the DMV, lyrics this brash would be delivered over a brooding instrumental that sounds like a producer tossed tense hi-hats and blaring 808s over the A Nightmare on Elm Street theme. But Ka$hdami’s tracks don’t resemble that at all—they’re sweet and, despite the violence, come off as the innocent imaginations of a teenager who fell in love with his local street rap scene on the internet.The best songs on epiphany bring to mind taking a wholesome skip through the park. “Figures” even starts out with birds chirping before the ethereal beat kicks in. Ka$hdami’s rhymes aren’t quite an afterthought, but they’re more about his rough yet sort of melodic delivery. Unlike his DMV-based inspirations, his punchlines aren’t that colorful or memorable, but they don’t have to be—plugg music was always more about fantasy. On “Trust Issues,” a beat that feels like cannonballing off a cliff into a warm body of water, the way he glides over the track is enough to overlook writing that is basically filler. If anything, the song is held back by miserable-sounding features—this happens again and again on the project. The only purpose of these guest verses is to stretch his songs beyond the two-minute mark. It’s unnecessary—making short songs is fine! “Look N the Mirror!” (at 1:25) and “Dior” (1:58) are his best tracks to date.A handful of instrumentals on epiphany feel similar to that original wave of bland “type beats” that diluted the sound. “Up!” and “See Ya!” have all too familiar melodies that seem as if they’ve been used better before. The easiest way to avoid this is to go straight to the source as he does on “Receipts,” which is co-produced by StoopidXool, one of the innovators of the sound. It’s light and dreamy, and Ka$hdami’s punchy flow gives the track a darker edge. It’s a clash that not only defines his tape but the best plugg music as well.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week. Sign up for the 10 to Hear newsletter here."

Nathaniel Rateliff adheres to this weathered cliche with And It’s Still Alright, his first album without the Night Sweats since 2015 but not his first solo album, not by a long shot. The Night Sweats was his last-gasp attempt at the big time, a neo-soul combo that helped reposition the Denver troubadour as a soul man—a transition aided by producer Richard Swift, who became a friend and a trusted collaborator.Swift died unexpectedly in 2018, the same year Rateliff divorced his wife after a “tumultuous” relationship. The twin losses inspired the singer/songwriter to record the melancholy, meditative And It’s Still Alright, an album designed to be everything a Night Sweats record is not: intimate, confessional, bittersweet. Rateliff cut the album in part to fulfill a promise to Swift, who told the songwriter, “Keep pushing for those Harry Nilsson tunes, man”—to which Rateliff responded, “Well, we’ll see how Nilsson I can get.”The answer is, not very Nilsson at all, not even when Rateliff takes pains to stage his own Pandemonium Shadow Show—laboring to replicate the iconic songwriter’s whimsical melodies on “All or Nothing,” or giving “Expecting to Lose” a swaying sing-song bridge. In any case, evoking the ghost of Harry Nilsson is a particularly odd move from Rateliff, since Nilsson—one of pop’s great eccentrics, who recently received a boost when his “Gotta Get Up” was featured in Natasha Lyonne’s Netflix series Russian Doll— was never exactly a paragon of sincerity. Even at his quietest moments, Nilsson favored a bit of the old razzle-dazzle: His celebrated 1970 LP Nilsson Sings Newman doubles as an interpretive masterstroke and a display of studio wizardry, where he proved his vocal virtuosity by overdubbing every harmony part. If Rateliff is anything, it’s doggedly earnest. Whether he’s grinding out old-school soul with the Night Sweats or flying solo, he’s obsessed with the idea of authenticity: the idea that a song isn’t a song unless it can be convincingly played alone on an acoustic guitar.Ultimately, this old folkie notion of purity triumphs over Rateliff’s composerly aspirations. The lion’s share of And It’s Still Alright backslides to the gormless balladeering of his decade-old Rounder debut, In Memory of Loss—a record made when he was under the spell of M. Ward, peddling himself as “bi-curious, redneck indie-folk” and touring with Bon Iver. Set aside the Nilsson pastiche and a lingering echo of the Lumineers—most prominent on “Mavis,” which he stresses is not named after Mavis Staples, even though that’s the first Mavis that would come to most listeners’ minds—and Alright can seem like a collection of artifacts excavated from Rateliff’s early years. He strums and he mumbles, twisting in his melancholy without bothering to shape his mood into melodies. If he’s baring his soul, his revelations are buried within his slurred, mangled phrasing, a delivery that repels the close listen it’s intended to invite.That mush mouth is supposed to be the opposite of the retro R&B bluster that Rateliff hauls out for the Night Sweats, but the two extremes are really just different expressions of the same affectation. Rateliff bends his vocal attack to suit his chosen musical style. With the Night Sweats, he’s elevated with grit and muscle, but strumming solo on And’s Still Alright, he gets bogged down in a melancholy murk.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Lovecraft looms large within the extreme-metal imagination, and the Oakland trio Ulthar—who take their name from one of the author’s short stories—is far from the first band to fall under its spell. The band’s sophomore LP, Providence, which is named for Lovecraft’s hometown, features album art studded with skulls and plague buboes, resembling one of those cursed Victorian mourning wreaths woven from human hair. Those surface-level clues immediately alert the listener that they’re in for an unsettling ride (and is, artistically, par for the course for Ulthar). There is a certain ghastly air to the proceedings, as though the trio had discovered a nest of eldritch tentacles in the cellar while recording and decided to keep on playing. With Lovecraft himself, the true horror was what a racist, anti-Semitic shitbag he was, but here, that wyrd atmosphere is conjured in good faith, and conducted with blackened grandiosity.The people involved have decades of experience between them in the study and execution of extremity, from drummer Justin Ennis’s tenure in NYC black metallers Mutilation Rites and current project Void Omnia to vocalist and guitarist Shelby Lermo’s experience with Bay Area death cult Vastum and bassist and vocalist Steve Peacock’s time in off-kilter blasphemers Pale Chalice and Mastery. It is unsurprising that Ulthar is a good band, but Providence is not just a good record, it is a great one, and the reasons for that go far beyond its creators’ resumes.They couch their devotion to old-school death metal orthodoxy within a modern context; there's no mud, or murk, or self-conscious efforts to sound lo-fi, and the technical aspects are presented plainly, without apology or artifice. Providence allows no time for niceties on its short, brutish opening track, “Churn,” from which “Undying Spear” offers a brief respite before the rippling melody is torn to shreds by an imperious blast. Ulthar’s sound mingles black metal, death metal, doom, and thrash, and they skitter between genres in the leaps of a scale. But Providence owes a particular debt to Finish masters like Demigod, Convulsed, and Demilich, an earlier cohort who innately understood the importance of tempering technical flights with grounded riffs and headbanging tempos.There is a certain sameness to a few of the album's eight tracks, so those that take the time to experiment invariably stand out. “Through Downward Dynasties” creeps in with an eerie ambient intro, flush with whooshing synthesizer effects and ominous undertones. It soon explodes into a flurry of blastbeats, precise scales, and icy, controlled chaos. Album closer “Humanoid Knot” revels in its own strangeness, from Lermo’s unhinged cackling to its slow, juddering riffs.Recorded by Bay Area mainstay Greg Wilkinson at Earhammer Studios and mastered by Adam Tucker at Signaturetone Recording, the album just sounds good, always listenable despite its undeniable brutality. They started strong on their 2016 demo and hit their stride with 2018’s monstrous Cosmovore, but with Providence, Ulthar has raised the bar on themselves yet again. With each release, their understanding of the art of death metal continues to deepen and spiral off into unexpected territory."

Tyler Childers),3.49e-05,1.0,7.0,0.942,american,8.0,"Colter Wall is one of country music’s most exciting young voices. His debut album is strange and stirring, rarely ever rising above a gentle rumble.","During the mid-1990s, a new back-to-basics movement swept through country music. Johnny Cash kicked off his fruitful American Recordings partnership with Rick Rubin; Willie Nelson released the sparse, unadorned Spirit; and—in the city of Swift Current in Saskatchewan, Canada in June 1995—Colter Wall was born. Blessed with a curious, slurring baritone that burbles like smoke from a chimney, Wall writes country songs as stark and traditional as they come, accompanied by little more than an acoustic guitar. To call him wiser than his years would be an understatement: veteran songwriters go to great lengths to sound so gruff and world-weary. The 11 tracks on his self-titled debut are strange and stirring enough to make him one of the genre’s most exciting young voices.Rarely ever rising above a gentle rumble, Wall’s songs zoom in on haunting scenes and resolve in unexpected ways. They gain their intensity from his vivid, fragmented storytelling. The album begins with “Thirteen Silver Dollars,” a spirited ramble that finds our narrator lying in the snowy streets of Saskatchewan before a cop comes to take him away. Wall never explains how he wound up there (“For now we’ll say I had no place to go,” he offers) or what happens next—there’s not even a second verse. Instead, he closes with a rousing repetition of the chorus, proudly naming the few possessions he owns. It’s a fitting introduction to an album built from small details, conjuring larger pictures with what’s left out.Wall’s aversion to narrative spans the record and makes these songs a lot more hallucinogenic than their earthy arrangements suggest. “Kate McCannon” is told through one of folk music’s oldest tropes: the dual love song/murder ballad. But Wall offers little time for reflection, fading out shortly after the cathartic and inevitable round of gunfire in the song’s final couplet. “I ain’t in the business of making excuses,” Wall sings earlier in the album, and he doesn’t. As often as he references guns and drugs and death, Wall is too plainspoken for his stories to ever feel glamorized or romantic. Like Springsteen on Nebraska, Colter Wall surveys mankind in its most fragile states—betrayed, lonely, desperate, dangerous—as a means of addressing how much we have to lose, how easily it can all fall apart.“You Look to Yours” offers the album’s most useful (and timely) bit of advice: “Go about your earthly mission,” Wall sings, “Don’t trust no politicians.” Tellingly, the wisdom doesn’t arrive from Wall himself but from a series of women eloquently turning him down in various seedy bars, their kiss-offs echoing in his head as he stumbles home alone. Hummable and warm, it’s one of the album’s most upbeat songs, effortlessly summoning the honky-tonks Wall sings about with a lazy swing. “Motorcycle” is another moment of levity with a cheerful melody that masks the death wish driving its lyrics. The friction in Wall’s delivery highlights the genre’s ability to blend pain and joy past the point of differentiation: a power he seems to harness intuitively.The album was produced by David Cobb—the go-to guy for breakthrough acts like Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, and Chris Stapleton. But Cobb takes a decidedly unmodern approach, letting Wall’s songs speak for themselves. The two songs on the albums that Wall didn’t write (Townes Van Zandt’s “Snake Mountain Blues” and the traditional “Fraulein”) slip seamlessly into the tracklist: an indication of just how gloriously out of touch his writing is. In the slow, ominous “Me and Big Dave,” Wall revels in his outsider mentality while conceding to the dangers of a life spent alone. “This whole world’s full of ghosts,” he concludes, “I believe that most people can’t see.” It’s one of the album’s most powerful lyrics, sold with a fierce and frightening conviction. For 40 minutes, Colter Wall brings you face to face with his ghosts until they’re so familiar you can hardly remember life without them."

Consider Burial, whose substantial initial buzz was fueled as much by his haunting South London nightscapes as it was by his initial anonymity. In 2004, Black Devil Disco Club's eponymous EP arrived with a pretty fantastic history: Originally recorded in 1978 by an obscure French producer (and even then working under an pseudonym) who had released no other work, the record was picked up by Rephlex Records' PP Roy at a fleamarket, DJed by the likes of Luke Vibert and Aphex Twin, and subsequently reissued to much speculation that the whole thing was just another alias for one of the label's notoriously tricky artists. Helping to fuel such theories was the fact that Black Devil's idiosyncratic sound-- that metronomic disco beat, murky synth arpeggios, and slippery, scat-like singing-- seemed simultaneously like a forward-thinking album frozen in amber and of a piece with the retro Italo disco streak that was just gaining speed in mid-2000s electro.Bernard Fevre, the man in fact behind Black Devil Disco Club, returned two years later with the aptly titled 28 After, an album that stuck so closely to the debut's template that many reviewers immediately started speculating again as to whether these were new recordings or another batch of tracks from the 70s. Circus, then, represents an unequivocal step into the present for Black Devil Disco Club, if one that still makes a virtue of Fevre's relative anonymity-- this time by hiding him behind guest stars. Reportedly consisting of all new recordings, at the very least each of Circus' 10 tracks features freshly recorded guest vocals from current artists like YACHT and Cosmetics as well as acts closer to Fevre's vintage, such as Afrika Bambaataa and Nancy Sinatra.The results are mixed. Jon Spencer delivers a cosmic, slightly pompous-sounding sermon (peace, love, changing the world) on ""Fuzzy Dream"". Claire L. Evans sings, with characteristically cool detachment, about Jesus returning to a modern world hostile to his ideas, in keeping with YACHT's fascination with religious imagery. Bambaataa orates soulful and spooky on ""Magnetic Devil"", boasting, ""I know who is Black Devil/ Through and through the years we play the dark music together,"" while maintaining that he is ""suspicious"" and ""afraid""; occasionally, he is interrupted by a Mac computer voice. Cosmetics' Aja Emma recounts the contents of a dream in her appropriately heavy-lidded, breathy voice. Throughout, Fevre occasionally interjects his own skipping singing behind his collaborators, and on ""Pavement Opposite"" he (or, it's always possible, some other mysterious male vocalist) even rises to the level of duet, doubling and echoing Nancy Fortune's indecisive refrains.Beyond these appearances, Circus doesn't do much to expand or update Black Devil Disco Club's sound. Fevre still favors percolating synth bass lines, hand drumming, and steady hi-hat shushing beats, often treated with short slapback delays and dark, echoing reverb. There are a few piano keys here, and a little flute-like synth flutter there, but mostly Fevre seems committed to the sonic template he first laid down over 30 years ago. Nor does he meet any of his collaborators halfway-- there's no blues guitar from Spencer, for instance, or any other outside instrumental contributions. Black Devil Disco Club's sound is durable enough to endure unchanged, but Circus feels like a missed opportunity for Fevre to open up his hermetic world and stretch things out a bit."

He was last seen in an East Village dive bar, martini in one hand, rhyming dictionary in the other. Can't really blame him for keeping a low profile, though; after dropping an epic achievement like 69 Love Songs on the unsuspecting public, you'd take a break, too. While the Magnetic Fields have been recently plucked out of the draft by superlabel-in-the-making Nonesuch, Merritt's yet to release a follow-up under his highest-profile name, choosing instead to focus on scoring films, farewell live performances of 69, and writing a musical with stock accordionist and children's author Daniel Handler.Oh yeah, and also releasing another collaboration with Christopher Ewan under the sacrilicious nom de plume of Future Bible Heroes. Like the Heroes' last full-length, 1997's Memories of Love, Eternal Youth has Ewan electronically arranging songs co-written with Merritt, with vocals added by Magnetic Fields drummer/occasional singer Claudia Gonson. And also like its predecessor, Eternal Youth feels like more of a lackluster stopgap than equal-footing sidecar for Merritt's songcraft, a frustrating teaser from the Merritt portfolio of aliases.Part of the problem seems to lie with Ewan's arrangements, electro-pop that no doubt endears him to the equally 80s-fixated Merritt. While Merritt's electronic backings often sound like dancefloor anthems for the club inside his head, Ewan's slicker touch has the tendency to present the songs like actual club anthems, losing a lot of the intimacy of the Magnetic Fields' productions. Fair enough, but perhaps not the wisest of approaches given Merritt's flair for clever wordiness, Tin Pan Alley-style melodicism, and Gonson's voice.Gonson's occasional microphone duties on 69 Love Songs were a treat, as Merritt's songs tend to sound good delivered by the opposite gender. But as the sole vocalist on Eternal Youth (Merritt's Cash-ian baritone sits this one out), the pleasure of her slightly disinterested, sorta flat tone wears before long. Irony being dead and all (or so I'm told), the detached vocal is an endangered species, and Gonson's throws a warm blanket over the romantics of ""No River"", dampens space oddity ""Doris Day the Earth Stood Still"", and creates the wrong kind of bedroom voice on the smooth-operating ""A Thousand Lovers in a Day"".Merritt, meanwhile, remembers to bring his usual lyrical tricks (""I'd rather be a queen when the rooks take wing than be losing your affection,"" for instance), but seems to use a lot of his C-list melodies. For a Next Wave of Song-certified man known for penning instant-timeless melodies, it's disappointing to sit through stiffs like ""Find an Open Window"" or ""Kiss Me Only With Your Eyes"" that don't even come close to taking a spot on one's in-head playlist. ""I'm a Vampire"" is pristine danceable camp and ""From a Dying Star"" is a catchy/haunting continuation of the extraterrestrial theme, but on most of these tracks, Merritt sounds too much like he's phoning it in; ""The World is a Disco Ball"" could be a Magnetic Fields sendup on some forthcoming collection of indie rock interpretations by Weird Al (for which working titles would certainly include No Al-Ternative, My Bloody Alentine and Al's Tomorrow Parties).So the spotlight's on Ewan, who fills Eternal Youth with serviceably average synthetic-pop dioramas. The album is weighed down with sub-minute interlude filler, some of which (i.e. the almost-Timbaland-style skittery-strings of ""Viennese Lift"") are more interesting than the full-length backdrops, but which still kill what turtle-ish momentum the song cycle manages to establish. From the evidence presented on Eternal Youth, Ewan sounds mostly like the bad influence kid-next-door to Merritt, pushing him back from the slightly more organic sound of recent fare towards his (weaker) bleached-out keyboard symphony/guest vocalist early days. Maybe he's just taking some practice laps before turning on the Magnetic Field generator again, but regardless, non-completists are better off waiting for the real deal."

Maybe it's a sign I need to spend less time talking with other music writers, because the consensus appears to be an overwhelming, ""dear fucking god, TOTALLY."" Maybe I'm just naïve, having exited the decade as a teen, but Pinkerton, the NHL 92-96, Higher Learning...we had some good times, right? It's within this context that I fear for Lemuria, even with a promising debut in tow. Because their sales pitch can definitely double as a dealbreaker for some: This sounds just like 1993.The Buffalo foursome may be playing it safe by aligning themselves with the likes of Superchunk and the Weakerthans, but I'm not buying it. If you were old enough to watch MTV and buy CDs, but too young to realize that Belly and the Breeders actually started as spin-off acts, Get Better probably rules. Indeed, Lemuria follow in the path of coy, mixed-sex acts of the alt-rock era, and nowhere is that more clear than in the vocals. Sheena Ozzella and Alex Kerns have an inverse ratio of singing/songwriting, with Ozzella playing the Jenny Lewis role (clearly the lead, sweet and sour demeanor that skirts the ""girly"" tag) while Kerns is more of the Blake Sennett, sporting a slacker deadpan used far more rarely-- good for song-by-song distinctiveness, not so much for harmonizing.Still, you'll be surprised just how fun this can still sound-- ""Pants"" has a rambling melody that recalls ""In a Big Country"" over four DOD fuzz pedal chords. But what comes across from ""Pants"" in particular is that many of these songs feel social and conversational. And none really take themselves too seriously; ""Yesterday's Lunch"" plays around with the line ""it doesn't matter if you've succeeded"" before dropping the Morrissey punchline at the end ""...you'll never feel successful until all your friends fail."" Elsewhere, the subjects are steadfast in their everyday mundanity, things like drunk boyfriends, the girl in the mirror, store clerks.But there's a reason you can go on Amazon.com with $20, buy back all of your Buzz Bin CDs, and still have change-- 75% of the time, you'd forget just about everything that happened from songs 7-10. Get Better loses a lot of its fizz in its second half as the hooks become more indistinct; ""Dog"" and ""Dogs"" apparently are different songs, but the lack of any real segue makes it impossible to tell, and as a whole, they fall into to a spate of sub-two minute blurs that don't establish a welcome they can even wear out.Plus, I'm not sure we're ready for a song built on a thrift store metaphor just yet and while Ozzella is clearly the breadwinner, at times she overdoes it-- to hear her yelp ""I'm missing you MORE THAN I'M KISSING YOU"" is a bit...much. Still, Lemuria have positioned themselves properly with an enjoyable if somewhat inconsistent debut that the world might not be as ready for as they may be in three years or so when they release their sophomore jam during a (probably inevitable) 90s revival. By being slightly behind the times, Lemuria might just be ahead of the game."

Their debut was a blend of 1960s rock swagger, infectious melodies, and wry humor, becoming a minor cult hit among the DIY set and receiving both an enthusiastic rave by John Darnielle and an opening slot for his Mountain Goats on tour in 2010. Stay Home finds the band using the attention they've received as inspiration to clean up their act... a little.While Spit in the Face-- described by the band as ""a collection of 12 songs about being cool""-- executed the ""cool"" concept right down to its outrageously limited run of 200 physical copies and hand-drawn, Crayola-core cover art, Stay Home is (spoiler alert) ""a collection of 13 new songs about staying home."" ""This ain't paranoia, no it's not,"" sing guitarist Juan Wauters and bassist Jose Garcia in unison on ""Hens & Roosters"", debunking any notion that the album was created by a group of Chicken Littles crouched in fear of the sky crumbling around them. But the record is very much about staying home, whether parking your behind in front of the boob tube (the raucous and charmingly amateurish ""Watching TV""), hanging out with your old man (""Pops N Me""), or doing the same with the person you love (""Your Name Is on My Bones"").With delivery split between singing and barking, the relative clarity of Garcia and Wauters' voices benefit their songs greatly-- as opposed to the last album, you can almost make out the lyrics. Still, they're buried far enough in the mix that the vocals are just another instrument, equal with all other components of the songs. The near-sneer in songs like ""Dead"" and ""Knock on Wood"" nestle in perfectly with the arcane chord changes, while ""Pops N Me"" features call-and-response vocals that accurately replicate the comedic, exaggerated singing of 60s musicals and sitcoms. Though there have always been plenty of bands mining the same era, with reverbed vocals and drummers that don't sit down, Stay Home captures attitude and devil-may-care confidence better than most of today's bands worth their weight in Nuggets compilations."

On her second solo album, she transports us further and takes us higher than she ever could have as the drummer of an indie pop revivalist band.","Frankie Rose spent a few years kicking around the Brooklyn jangle-pop scene before striking out on her own: As the most charismatic member of Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, and Dum Dum Girls, she was a reliable bolt of onstage electricity enlivening the often noncommittal presences around her. It was pretty clear, even then, that she was eventually destined for bigger things, but her first solo record, recorded under the name Frankie Rose and the Outs, still felt constrained by a reflexive sort of cool-kid slouch. Between that record and Interstellar, she has dropped the pretense of a backing band entirely, and is recording simply as ""Frankie Rose."" The implicit point is clear: This time around, she's going for it.The first moments of ""Interstellar"" make this point immediately. The song opens on a cool-blue vista of synthesizers, a transportingly vast sound of the sort Frankie's never made before. When her voice enters the mix, cooing about interstellar highways and moon dust, it's piped from above, passed through a series of filters so until she slightly resembles the Laurie Anderson of ""O Superman"". A minute in, a massive, Valhalla-pound drum hit resounds, the synths explode sideways, and Frankie hurls us down a flume ride of descending vocal harmonies. It's the most colorful, thrilling music of her career, and as grand a pronouncement as one can make that we're not doing things the same way anymore.Interstellar is a big, second-album leap of faith into deeper waters, a sparkling synth-pop record that wants very badly to mean something to dreamy, hyper-emotional twentysomethings. For her model, she's taken the impression of some of the dreamiest, most hyper-emotional records of her youth. The production on Interstellar is gorgeous, and clearly modeled on the Cure's big, panoramic pop records, like Disintegration: booming-canyon drums, acres of spannable horizon. The drum beat that opens up ""Know Me"" is virtually identical to that of ""Close to Me"", and the silvery guitar leads on ""Gospel/Grace"" are pretty much mimeographed from ""Plainsong"". But although Rose indulges pretty heavily in the Cure's primary colors, she paints something distinctly her own with them. The world of Interstellar is a vision of paradise as lifted from the front of a Trapper Keeper: air-brushed, pastel-hued, and gloriously vivid.Interstellar is not a thematically rich experience-- it basically has one single invitation, and that is to swim with Frankie in the glorious bath of echoes she's drawn for herself. ""All that I want is a pair of wings to fly/ Into the blue, a wide open sky/ Show me your scars, I'll show you mine/ Perched out of the city on a pair of power lines,"" she sings over and over on ""Pair of Wings"", and you can hear this yearning for escape echoed in the record's every upward-spiralling note. Her singing has always been breathy and modest, but on Interstellar, her voice seems to mist on contact, even when she's swirling herself into a prismatic mini-choir of Frankies. On her record, she's just another celestial body orbiting larger ones.The resulting album isn't one you actively explore so much as bask in gratefully. The longer I spend immersed in it, the more I appreciate its details: the haunting, truncated piano chords that the melody of ""Apples for the Sun"" clumps around, or the way Frankie's voice melts into and becomes one with the bloom of synthesized strings in the last minute of ""Gospel/Grace"". Rose is tapping the same slightly shameless clear eyes/full hearts well of teen melodrama that sourced M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, and she demonstrates the same kind of focus and vision in carrying it off. On Interstellar, she transports us further and takes us higher than she ever could have as the drummer of an indie pop revivalist band. Amen to breaking free of sonic restrictions when they outlive their usefulness."

GoldLink’s “Crew” snowballed into a smash as the months warmed, and it’s Glizzy’s verse that cuts the song in half, interrupting an otherwise sinewy and droning R&B jam with a jumpy giddiness. The eager opening of his verse—“Hey! Nice to meet/I’m Young Jefe, who you be?”—is the type you brace for all along, the obvious “this is my favorite part” of one of the year’s happiest surprises. Of course, it wasn’t an introduction so much as a mainstream moment of arrival. Glizzy has been at or near the center of D.C. hip-hop since at least 2014, and “Crew” felt more like lending a hand than climbing a social ladder. But where GoldLink burrowed into D.C. music tradition for a statement album that blipped his city back into the mainstream hip-hop consciousness, Glizzy channels the pervasive sounds of Atlanta trap for his own contemporary D.C. soundtrack.Glizzy’s latest mixtape, Quiet Storm, is an ambitious 18 songs, but he’s successfully designed it to glide by. Almost every beat is in a softly-synthed, languid trap style, and Glizzy is rarely as jumpy as he appears on “Crew.” Instead, he hosts the project as the center of attention, a pop artist with a full arsenal of graceful melody to match the tone. Go-to Atlanta producers like TM88, Goose, and Yung Lan dot the landscape with tracks that sound smooth but not slick, and often take shape out of minor key atmospherics. Glizzy uses the same sounds to channel opulent romance (“Blow a Bag”) and morbid existentialism (“Take Me Away”), sometimes on the same song. “Get Away” is a versatile escapist anthem: crime chase and sentimental runaway at once.Glizzy has also rekindled his surefire working relationship with the Atlanta producer Zaytoven, whose keyboard twinkles on “One Day” might echo some of his previous productions (see Future’s “Peacoat”), but remain vital enough to appear on both this album and the producer’s own recent solo outing. For all the Atlanta stars Zaytoven’s beats have canvassed, Glizzy might treat them the best. He slips into the first verse with droning couplets and jumps out of the second to yelp out his bona fides. For the chorus, he churns hope into a mantra, promising and reminding himself of the purpose of his grind: “All my niggas gon’ ball one day.”Besides the smartly streamlined curation of beats, Quiet Storm also folds in carefully doled out features: Trey Songz carries a swaggering hook on “Dope Boy Magic” and Dave East punches into “Get It Again” with a relentless string of brags. As the de facto leader and concentrated star power of the D.C. crew Glizzy Gang, Shy shares space with 3 Glizzy and 30 Glizzy on “Haters Anthem” for a track that greets envy with biting inspirationalism. But there’s a sour side here too. In September, 30 Glizzy was shot and killed in Baltimore, and his brief appearance on the Quiet Storm tracklist prefaces a heartfelt tribute at the end of the album. That closer, “Take Me Away,” is dangerously morose, edging into depressive suicidal thoughts as Glizzy caps off each chorus line with an open invitation for death. Glizzy sounds both like an open-wound and depressed shut-in here. “It’s a war started outside, don’t wanna talk about it,” he yelps. For all the giddiness Glizzy carries onto many of his songs, he’s never been more endearing than this, wallowing in justifiable street survivalism. More than ever, he sounds like the open heart of his city."

His latest LP as Rafter, Quiet Storm, finds him once again staking out new territory. Released abruptly in late January, the digital-only release is said to draw inspiration from ""black metal demo tapes"" Rafter and his touring companions listened to while out on the road supporting last year's attempt at poly-glam Of Montreal-pastiche, Animal Feelings.Quiet Storm doesn't really sound like black metal at all, nor does it sound like, in Rafter's words, ""Darkthrone meets the Kinks meets Lee Perry."" But the record is reminiscent of Microphones/Mount Eerie godhead Phil Elverum's recent dalliances with the dark arts, namely, Mount Eerie's 2008 EP, Black Wooden Ceiling Opening. Both that record and Quiet Storm apply a similar amp-blown aesthetic to the songs. But while Elverum's affection for lo-fi and disquieting distortion is nothing new, Rafter's music has never sounded this harsh and abrasive-- almost every drum hit on this record crackles and blasts through everything else surrounding it. The technique adds a crunchy texture to the material, foregrounding Rafter's debt to the spikier end of 1990s indie rock. Elsewhere, the new dressings add an ominous, discordant feel to the record's more dirge-like moments (see album closer ""Born Again"" and the clattering din of ""Coldness of Space"").Rafter has experimented with recording fidelity in the past (see: 2008's Sex Death Cassette), and Quiet Storm is arguably his most successful venture in this arena so far. Ironically, though, the sound of the record ultimately holds it back. There's simply too much noise here, and it's often poorly placed. The more melodic material falls flat in this setting, and tedium truly sets in during the album's mid-section, where melody is set aside almost entirely in favor of twitching electronics and toppled percussion. At its best, though, the scattered, ramshackle nature of Quiet Storm manages to transcend these difficult passages. And for those who'd rather hear Rafter in a different sonic guise, chances are you won't have to wait long for him to change it up again."

For all the cosmic wonder he can evoke by placing electronics against naturalistic backdrops, Hebden has often gotten himsef stuck in ruts, even if just for a few moments here and there. In part, that's the fate of an improviser, but it's exacerbated by samplers and machines that can be slow to respond to Hebden's shifts, however smartly they're triggered. In improvised music, it's one thing to sound like you're in transition and another thing to actually be in transition.None of that mattered on Ringer, thanks in part to techno's formalist grounding. But it matters a lot on NYC, the fourth album made by Hebden and jazz drummer Steve Reid. Ringer's functional dance-music accepts, even privileges, the kind of ruts that have tripped up Hebden in the past; NYC, meanwhile, puts them to work in settings that serve different purposes. On the duo's earlier albums, Hebden and Reid occasionally sounded like they were only barely aware of what the other was doing or might stand to do next. On NYC, they sound much more conscious and sympathetic.""Lyman Place"" starts the album with an unvarying few-note bass-line set against the sound of a jet engine rising in long, slow takes. It sounds like something Miles Davis would have done in the 1970s, and Hebden's relative understatedness helps set off Reid's drumming-- circular, splashy, coyly shrouded by the shimmer of persistent cymbals. ""1st & 1st"" follows with a fit of funk built around a guitar sample that Hebden makes sound twitchy, like a signal from a world away.It sounds as if Hebden made a strategic decision to do less on this album, which heightens the impact when he does make a move. Reid benefits greatly from the space to breathe-- much of his drumming on the duo's other records sounds comparatively crowded and confused by how to connect with Hebden. And Hebden himself shows off a new sense of always being in the right place at the right time, without getting caught out in between. He hasn't lost any of the polyglot record-collector drive that has made Four Tet matter from the start: NYC wanders through spells informed by melodica-strewn dub, shoegaze rock, weird folk, and of course the clattering sense of purpose at work in free-jazz. But Hebden sounds considerably more easy-going now, like he's taking time to listen in to what comes out as it happens all around him."

Their oft-delayed debut album features Tricky, Sia, Planningtorock, the xx's Romy Madley Croft, Alejandra Deheza of School of Seven Bells, and others.","CREEP seemed to fade away before they really got started. The Brooklyn-based duo of Lauren Dillard and Lauren Flax showed promise with their 2010 single ""Days"", only to find their momentum diluted by a minor controversy and an affiliation with a fly-by-night genre. That song was a joint effort with Romy Madley Croft from the xx, who was the first in a string of collaborators to come on board with Dillard and Flax to help flesh out the band's sound. CREEP have surfaced intermittently over the last three years, often as remixers, but also with occasional advances on their own take on trip-hop. Some of the artists they helped remix come on board as collaborators here (Planningtorock, Alejandra Deheza of School of Seven Bells), on an oft-delayed album that plunges into the darkness and never looks back, pulling in a mix of old and new tracks on the way down.If nothing else, Echoes is a timely release, coming at a point when artists such as Arca, FKA twigs, and DropxLife are developing a potent strain of 21st century trip-hop. Where those artists take the genre as a starting point, CREEP remain fully immersed in the sound, siphoning off some of its dingiest moments as a primal source. As such, Echoes is more Mezzanine than Blue Lines, recalling the point where Massive Attack sucked any remnants of optimism out of their sound. For a collection of tracks culled from such a long period of time, and with a different guest vocalist on each, it's a surprisingly coherent and linear album. ""Days"" doesn't sound out of place from (presumably) more recent recordings, such as the mournful ""Vertigo"", which features the welcome return of Lamb singer Lou Rhodes.In among the shade there's a sense of drama forcing through the fog, with most tracks shaped by sparse arrangements and echo-y vocals. It has the unfortunate effect of making CREEP sound like they're trying too hard to make a bold statement with every turn they take, perpetually searching for a spine-chilling moment that's just beyond their reach. Mostly the execution is lacking—the beats on ""Empty Church"" are ghostly thin, the synths on ""Jessica King"" are set to the ""plume of smoke"" preset for the nth time, the Sia-featuring ""Dim the Lights"" rubs stodgy strings up against a too-predictable music box sound. The guest vocalists occasionally shine despite their surroundings. Tricky's turn on ""Call Her"" is particularly notable, reaching whispery Maxinquaye peaks while Deheza works up perfectly floaty harmonies behind him.What binds the original trip-hop artists, who were reluctant (to say the least) to be grouped together under the banner, was a sense of people digging deep into introspection, often reaching a point that was uncomfortably personal. There was a grit to what they were doing, a sense of beats that had been labored over for months, of samples that had been endlessly tweaked through the night. Echoes, despite its long gestational period, resembles the work of a couple of ""Twin Peaks"" freaks playing trip-hop dress up, even going so far as to channel David Lynch collaborator Julee Cruise on ""The Key"". Their best moment is still the skittering ""Days"", but sticking a song from 2010 on an album from 2013 feels like the actions of a band who are coming up short of ideas on how to move forward."

We've wanted more of something, and ...","Change has been boiling under ever since the decade clicked to double zeros. We've wanted more of something, and slowly we've realized what. What you're increasingly witnessing at every club, at every show, with every passing night, is the death of the horrible, awkward, uncomfortable tension of devoted music fans pretending not to enjoy music they have paid to see. Finally, we are shaking off the coma of the stillborn slacker 90s and now there is movement. Arms uncross, faces snap to attention, and clarity hits like religion. We have buried irony and pissed on its grave and for the first time we are realizing what rock music, rock shows are all about.Fuck, was that a dream? Pavement playing the Showbox in Seattle to throngs of unwashed hippie revivalists acting as if they'd been imprisoned there by a cruel master of ceremonies, their peer and equal Stephen Malkmus? Eddie Vedder iconically scrawling PRO-CHOICE up his left arm like he bore the weight of the entire fucking world and was the only living person with this Great Important Answer to all the world's problems? That the Dismemberment Plan-- among the first to envision this future at which we've now arrived-- called us out to our faces with ""Doing the Standing Still"" and we actually still just stood there? It's almost impossible to believe in light of music like this, music that finally places as much emphasis on real, true, palpable fun as it does on art.As brilliant as this music sounds on paper and CD, nothing compares to experiencing it live. I saw it taking shape (""but I was there!"") at the beginning of this summer in Chicago: The Rapture unleashing their primal digifunk on Chicago's stuffy Metro. As the band took the stage, two kids behind me absolutely lost their shit. Whatever it was they were doing, they were doing it alone-- at first. I've never seen anything like that: You could see it visibly sweeping the whole room. And these kids didn't have a clue ""how to dance,"" which was part of the brilliance of it: For one, it complemented the overcompensating freaks onstage not knowing how to play, but beyond that, it was the very spirit of punk. The revelation that you didn't need formal training to start a band in 1977 and the realization that you don't need to be Merce Cunningham to dance are one and the same. Fucking nobody knows how to dance at these shows-- in fact, you'd look like a jackass if you did."

Here, he goes from culturally sensitive to culturally imperialistic, and creates the record fans had originally hoped Aprop'at might be, employing his signature glitchmarks and cutting up singer Eva Puyuelo Muns' gentle coo.","Finally, Scott Herren has stopped being so damned culturally sensitive. Relocated from the American South to southern Spain, Herren fell in love with Barcelonan culture and music and recycled his former post-rock alias, Savath & Savalas, as an interpreter of Catalan folk music with this year's Apropa't LP. On paper, it sounded as if Herren would be applying his unique micro-editing CTRL-X/CTRL-V talents to another land's musical heritage, having already reprocessed the American tropes of jazz and hip-hop under his flagship moniker, Prefuse 73. Instead, Herren put his skittering rhythms in storage and produced a much softer album, like a romantic evening over a bottle of Rioja, a pot of paella, and sundry other stereotypically Spanish things.For those who thought they could forecast Herren's tactics, Apropa't was a surprise and, very likely, a disappointment. (""Oh gross, is this world music?!?"") Yet the project accomplished what Herren himself was likely looking to do: introduce his fans to the Catalan music of S&S; singer Eva Puyuelo Muns with a minimum of distraction and interpretation.But Herren has built a career on recontextualization-- be it of dusty vinyl excavations or his own compositions-- and this follow-up EP gives him space to exercise those strengths. 2003's Extinguished EP built a banquet out of leftovers from Prefuse 73's One Word Extinguisher album, mixing stray beats and found sound into a fully-developed companion piece. Mañana is also a re-imagination of source material; it's eight original songs that spin the Barcelona travelogue of Apropa't in a new direction.The first element one hears on Mañana is a cut-up, hiccuping vocal sample-- an immediate indication that Herren is using the EP to inject his Prefuse 73 methodology into the Savath & Savalas sound. Though the track is titled ""Interludio Inconcreto"", it might as well be an overture for the half-hour of music to follow. A beat-less swirl of abrupt string swells and disconnected syllables, the piece retains the hazy atmosphere of Apropa't while happily shirking traditional instrumentation and arrangement. ""Demà Vindrà"" accomplishes a similar feat, preserving the whispery vocals of Herren and Muns that dominate Apropa't but sautéing them on a bed of sampled string-plucks, static crackles, and headphone-hopping ooo's.Less subtle is ""Sota L'Aigüa"", on which an initial passage of soft singing and gentle backwards loops runs headlong into a surprise appearance by the kind of beat programming tweaked to perfection on One Word Extinguisher. For two minutes, this drum flurry gives Herren's Barcelonan project its strongest backbone, adding helpful variety to what was oftentimes on Apropa't a sound too weightless to leave an impression. ""No Puedo de Cidir"" is no less jarring when placed alongside traditional compositions; it sounds like a Tortoise outtake got mixed in with the S&S; masters at John McEntire's Soma Studios.The EP crests with ""Equipatage de Flors Seques"", wherein Herren gets all ""Revolution 9"" on his Barcelona period by pitting tetherless piano ramblings against loop fuckery that only coalesces for one short stretch. It's an intentionally disorienting take on the indigenous music at the project's core, and one wonders what Herren's collaborator Muns thinks of the final product-- and whether it's a coincidence that Mañana is rumored to be their final collaboration. But it's difficult to ignore that the track is far more interesting and dense than anything on Apropa't, at least to this typically foreign-culture-ignorant American. Mañana finds Herren working up the nerve to interpret the music of his adopted Spanish home instead of merely documenting it, and the results allow the EP to easily outshine its shy big brother."

Hunter idealizes, even canonizes, girls gone by, rendering them all good, and all the same. This is also true of his music: Hunter uses few instruments, though always in gorgeous combinations. The result is a great winter album-- one that sounds recorded over a snow day, as if Hunter and company holed up in a warm cabin and made a bricolage record, with half-remembered memories of people they may have never met as a lyrical influence. It's a small album that fills a room.And I'm not sure why, but I see the details of a room while I listen to Lightness-- smooth wood tables, warm air, natty wool rugs. Maybe it's because of the album's consistent textures: Hunter's roasted chestnuts voice (whose dryness sounds a little like Cat Stevens's or Richard Buckner's), soft sighs, and organic percussion. On tracks such as ""Canada"" Peter and the Wolf sound like they recorded on thick analog tape, or through a microphone wrapped in merino, though Hunter's timbre stays low and woody. There are no drums on Lightness, so percussion is charmingly lo-fi-- the heel of a palm striking the back of a guitar, or four beans rattling in a cup. Delicate guitar picking moves each track, along with ""oohhh""s and ""ahhh""s, which appear, murky or light, male and female, on almost every song.This comes together on ""Safe Travels"", which begins with a little shaker and rising/falling sighs over hair-thin guitar chords. Here Hunter doesn't sing about ex-girlfriends, but keeps same general sentiment-- recalling the best in people he no longer knows. The rest of Lightness does the same for women who are in Hunter's life: ""Dear Old Robyn"", for example, is a sea shanty transposed to a touring band, a sort of ""Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)"" for dudes on the road. ""I love you dear old Robyn/ I loved you all along/ To you I leave every word and every song,"" he and a pretty female voice sing together over bare guitar, about ""a love that will never come to be.""On other songs, Hunter pines over fleeting love. Who are these girls, by the way, who salsa dance gracefully (""Silent Movies""), float through the window like the Virgin Mary (""Bonsai Tree""), and are worth waiting 10,000 years to meet (""The Owl"")? By likening them to Mary (she's mentioned in ""Grey Overcoat"" as well, where he and a girl kiss under a statue of ""Mary, white and good""), Hunter views them as eternally kind, never drunk or dating his best friend-- after all, he's comparing them to a woman who was born and died without sin. On the quaint ""Silent Movies"", Hunter sings, ""Do you ever think of me when he's boring you?/ I bet you do"".Or maybe she's reminded of him because Hunter bores as well. That's the problem. The horn line in ""Safe Travels"" reminds us of the monotone that otherwise pervades Lightness. It's pretty much just vocals, guitar, and an egg shaker. Most of Lightness's 16 tracks don't cross the three-minute mark, and with so many sketches for so many sweethearts, it needs more variation. Only the bluesy, weird ""Black Saltwater"" and ""Captain Dan""-- with its oil drum percussion and spiky electric guitar-- stray from the album's repetition. But its insular quality is a positive, too. Hunter has played shows in cemeteries, on rooftops, and on islands people can only canoe to, presenting his music in special, intimate ways. Similarly, Lightness is a small album that turns unplatonic relationships into their Platonic ideals, expanding with each glance backward."

The album is an anomaly in an age of major label standardization: a debut done unmistakably on Tinashe’s own terms. Clams Casino, Dev Hynes, Future, A$AP Rocky, and others contribute.","It was the Platonic ideal of a 2014 chart-topper (Mustard on the beat—check; cheeky interpolation of a throwback hit—check; benevolent but ultimately useless Drake remix—check), so it’s no huge surprise that “2 On”, the star-making lead single from Tinashe’s debut album, Aquarius, proved to be a bit of a red herring. And while it’s still probably the best song of the Los Angeles singer/songwriter’s career, ultimately that’s a good thing. Tinashe’s post-“2 On” rise may have seemed sudden (and especially glaring, in a year where male voices overwhelmed the R&B charts), but the 21-year-old is hardly a rookie. After devoting most of her teenage years to the Stunners, a Vitamin C-founded quintet that briefly toured with Justin Bieber, she spent the last few years at work on a steady stream of promising, if unpolished, mixtapes recorded in her home studio. Those tapes—filled with dusky ballads for spooning a laptop and sounding quite at home among the glut of zoned-out, “alternative” R&B artists—got her a deal with RCA Records, but if the distance between her gently trippy mixtape work and the glossy ratchet-pop of “2 On” seemed potentially unbridgeable, it’s because she never intended to bridge it in the first place. Instead, Aquarius is an anomaly in an age of major label standardization: a debut done unmistakably on Tinashe’s own terms.Much of Aquarius feels like an ambitious extension of Tinashe’s mixtape tracks, elevated to professional quality where they once felt muddled while leaving breadcrumb trails of idiosyncratic details leading back to her bedroom-producer past—distorted guitar solos, eerie found-sound interludes, somber spoken word bits. Sure, sometimes it’s a little much: wide-eyed lines like “What is truth, if truth is subjective?” read more like “Ever seen the back of a $20 bill on weed?” similar to peer Jhené Aiko, another recent indie-to-major transitioner with a penchant for dorm-room stoner koans. Mostly, though, Tinashe’s polished her act without dulling her edge, as the most interesting tracks on Aquarius come closest to approaching anything remotely like a radio hit—consider “How Many Times”, a Janet Jackson-referencing, late-'80s worshipping duet with Future so sultry it renders his shouty “Sh!t” flow as aphrodisiacal.But Tinashe's most straightforward songs come with dark subtexts. Production-wise, second single “Pretend” has all the bite of an Avril Lavigne ballad playing during the break between ""Lizzie McGuire"" episodes (not necessarily a knock—somehow Detail’s mushiest productions are always his best) but the lyrics find Tinashe pretending her deadbeat boyfriend, played by A$AP Rocky, isn’t a scumbag so they can get it in a few more times. “All Hands On Deck”, the album’s sole answer to “2 On”'s club-readiness, has shadowy corners not often found in radio ratchetry, and that’s not counting the song's pan-flute breakdown: what first reads as a blithe dance instructional swiftly devolves into caustic post-break-up stunting, as Tinashe snarls, “Kiss the old me goodbye/ She's dead and gone.”"

It probably bears as much in common with watercolor as it does most electronic music.","One of last year's most warmly received archival discoveries was Talk to the Sea, a collection of unreleased recordings by the Italian musician Gigi Masin. His debut album, Wind, self-released in 1986, is an understated gem that falls somewhere between Balearic ambient music and secular new age, with echoes of Harold Budd, Jon Hassell, and Arthur Russell's World of Echo. It's not terribly well known, but those who have heard it tend to be passionate about it. A former radio DJ, Masin has done other things over the years, including a 1989 split LP with This Heat's Charles Hayward, on Sub Rosa, and, in the '00s, a handful of recordings for small Italian labels. But he's remained largely under the radar. I had never heard of Masin until I encountered Talk to the Sea, released by the fledgling Amsterdam label Music From Memory, but its impact was immediate—if ""impact"" is quite the right word for a sound so warmly, woozily amniotic, a sound entirely without hard surfaces or sharp edges.Masin returns here as one-third of Gaussian Curve, a multi-generational ensemble that also includes the Scottish musician Jonny Nash, a founder of the ESP Institute label and member of the synth-besotted softronica act Land of Light, and Amsterdam's Marco Sterk, better known for his woozy house productions under the Young Marco alias. Nash and Sterk first met Masin in the fall of 2013, and they wound up briefly jamming together in the house of a friend. The three musicians reconvened in Amsterdam in early 2014, and they ended up completing eight tracks in a single weekend. Clouds is the result of those sessions, and it's every bit as dreamlike as the musicians make the weekend sound. ""It was almost like we weren't involved,"" Nash told Juno Plus. ""It just slipped out.""The eight songs here, all instrumentals, feel less like standalone pieces than variations on a common theme. They share similar instrumentation, and they're all uniformly limpid and languid. Masin sets the tone, and the pace, with slow-moving chords on acoustic piano or Rhodes keyboard, while Nash and Sterk flesh out the songs with gently meandering electric guitar, wispy synthesizer pads, and, occasionally, trumpet and melodica. Given the trumpet, the music often brings to mind Jon Hassell's Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street. A few songs feature rudimentary drum-machine programming, mostly just tuned toms and woodblocks, that might be mistaken for dripping faucets. To call it ""atmospheric"" would be an extreme understatement. (On the closing ""Red Light"", they hold a microphone out the studio window and record the voices and footfalls of the alley outside.) It probably bears as much in common with watercolor as it does most electronic music.While the music unfolds with about as much drama as a smoke ring wafting towards the ceiling—about as much consequence, too—these are masterfully crafted mood pieces. In the opening ""Talk to the Church"", Masin mimics the chimes of a bell tower that loomed over the trio's studio, his chords gently bouncing and swaying, enlivened by millisecond-long syncopations and subtle shifts in volume. And despite the limited palette and the uniform tempos, they wisely change keys for virtually every song. So while the view remains the same, the light shifts, ever so subtly. True to the title, the experience of this short album, just 38 minutes long, feels a little like a time-lapse film of clouds crossing the sky—of day turning to night, and back again. With the closing ""Red Light"", the music returns to its original key, and it feels like things have come full circle. The logical response—my response, anyway—is to resume the cycle, and launch into the daybreak bells of ""Talk to the Church"" all over again."

I guess it worked out okay for them, but the perils of this approach are readily apparent: they came within inches of naming themselves the Commodes, and even closer to labeling themselves the Commodities. This is just an off-handed guess, but I'm thinking the three guys in True Love Always got the pedestrian title of their latest album (their fifth since 1997) using the same method.I base that assumption on the total inaccuracy of the title: if any thought went into it, it was certainly ironic, and that just doesn't seem to be their style. In reality, there's not a cloud in sight on this album, and as a matter of fact, irony is equally absent. The bossa-inflected pop these guys churn out is so breezy, it'll blow over any objects in the room not tightly secured, and if you hear a single distorted guitar anywhere on this record, you heard more than I did.Guitarist/vocalist John Lindaman seems to value clarity in all things, keeping his electric firmly rooted in a clean, jazzy tone, and singing in an even, warm tenor that sounds a lot like James Taylor with wider nasal passages. Drummer Matt Datesman and bassist Tony Zanella give things a minimal push with a series of easy rhythms, and generally manage to keep the backgrounds interesting, if harmless. This formula results in a bag of songs ranging from honey-soaked to just sugary; not a wide range, but when the songs are stuffed with moments like the chorus of the opener \x93Give Me the Clouds\x94-- where Lindaman and backing vocalist Evelyn Hurley paste huge harmonies all over an adhesive flytrap of a melody-- you don't so much mind. \x93Let the Rain Blow Ix94 even has a nice, understated guitar solo that would have fit in pretty well on A Hard Day's Night. \x93For You Alone\x94 features a fantastic, rapid-fire melody, but it's marred somewhat by the fact that Lindaman treats it as a duet with Hurley, and Hurley, while great on backup, doesn't quite cut it out in front.Problems also arise on songs like \x93Summer Books\x94, where the band's sense of economy gets them in trouble, resulting in an overly repetitive second half, with the lines \x93You, like summer books, don't kiss and tell/ And I'd be lost without you,\x94 repeated dozens of times. \x93Peel Away\x94 exaggerates that problem greatly, adopting what I suppose you could call a more experimental structure, with a vastly more fractured and a section where Lindaman layers his vocals, creating a repeated pattern of the partial phrase \x93why don't\x94 with a slower melody over it. It's conceptually very interesting, but somewhat annoying in execution. Still, points for branching out.Ultimately, I'm not really sure whether to celebrate or lament True Love Always for their complete lack of guile. On one hand, 36 minutes of pure silver lining can get a little tiresome, but it's also nice to see a band so direct and unassuming in this age of forced irony. Clouds is certainly pleasant listening, stuffed with good melodies and some accomplished musicianship, but it's also not likely to hook you back into a lot of repeated listens, given the way it lays all its cards out right away. A desultory toss of Webster's to the floor sums it up nicely: quaint. If that's your bag, have at it."

In commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the demise of KRS-One's career, I'd like to serve you some boogie-down style ""edutainment"" today. Consider, if you will, the following contrasts.PopulationCote D'Ivoire: 16,393,221The Ivory Coast: 5Life ExpectancyCote D'Ivoire: 44.93 yearsThe Ivory Coast: [insert joke of your choosing]Capital CityCote D'Ivoire: Yamoussoukro (official), Abidjan (unofficial)The Ivory Coast: Boston, MAForm of Government/Head of StateCote D'Ivoire: ""Democracy""/Laurent Gbagbo (seized power in coup, October, '00)The Ivory Coast: Committee/Jay Cox (vox, gtr), Nick Hubben (bass), Drew O'Doherty (gtr, vox), Scott Craggs (there's an ointment for that; synth), Mahmood Shaikh (drums).Natural HazardsCote D'Ivoire: heavy surf, no natural harbors, torrential flooding during rainy seasonsThe Ivory Coast: an over-reliance on their influences, and an uncomfortable imbalance between admiration and flat-out mimicry.ExportsCote D'Ivoire: cocoa, coffee, palm oilThe Ivory Coast: highly enthusiastic, synth-laced indie-pop reminiscent of certain aspects of Polyvinyl labelmates Rainer Maria, coupled with the production values of another Massachusetts indie outfit, the Swirlies, and betraying an obvious hankering for the feel of Modest Mouse's last full-length. Oh yeah, and the vocalist comes off like a low-budget version of Edsel's singer trying to sound like Superchunk, with a pinch of Ben Weasel.External DebtCote D'Ivoire: US$13.9 billionThe Ivory Coast: Incalculable debt to Vanessa Downing of the great, defunct Wicked Farleys for her vocal contributions to tracks 6, 7, and 10, and a lesser debt owed to Jeffrey Goddard of Karate for blowing his horn (trumpet, actually) on track 8.Historical OverviewCote D'Ivoire: I don't want to read your hate mail any more than you want to write it.The Ivory Coast: The quintet released The Rush of Incoming Traffic in 2000 on Big Top Records, a full two years after it had been recorded. Thus, they had a couple years of honing their songs and their shtick before defecting to Polyvinyl and releasing this sophomore effort, Clouds.ConclusionsCote D'Ivoire: a sure bet to supplant the United States as the global hegemonic power.The Ivory Coast: the outlook for this New England five-piece is not as certain. Clouds is without a doubt a solid album. High points include ""Five Little Graves,"" a sparse, spacy, sing-songy ode to love gone sour that recalls early Seely; ""Sixty-Five Percent"" a late-80s-style straight-up rock song that degenerates into an electronic outro like something off Depeche Mode's Violator; and, a short charming acoustic short entitled ""To My Brilliant Wigmaker,"" which boasts the album's best vocal line and chord changes.Nevertheless, there are certain prominent problems. Though vocalist Jay Cox is adequate, and sometimes better than that, his singing is the band's greatest shortcoming. His melodies would be better suited by a fuller, more in-command vocal style. Felix Houphouet-Boigny, Cote d'Ivoire's father of independence, was said to have a booming voice. Cox's, by comparison, is brittle and wavering. Will these indie popsters do right by history? Only time and their third album will tell!"

Since the Long Island quartet emerged near the end of the last decade with the charmingly lo-fi indie rock of Vampires With Dreaming Kids, they have pursued a number of alternate avenues—squishy synth-pop, stiff funk, starry disco. You could imagine plucking their eclectic, softly strange 2011 LP, In Heaven, from the aisles of Tower circa 1996, the disc alphabetically and musically lodged between Cibo Matto and Stereolab. Their self-titled 2014 album pushed their dance-oriented tendencies, flipping the way “dream pop” had often been used to describe their hard-to-classify stuff.Mr Twin Sister’s third full-length, Salt, adds new flourishes to that electrified approach— moonlit jazz-pop reminiscent of the increasingly influential British act the Blue Nile, the placid environs of chillout, slinking R&B, Auto-Tuned outré-pop. There’s a distinct downtown New York City vibe that runs throughout these songs. Sure, Salt elicits imagery of rain hitting a cab window after a night out. More important, Mr Twin Sister, like city contemporaries Yaeji and House of Feelings, tap into a distinctly urban vein through gentle mutations of house and techno, their sound reflecting the cosmopolitan, body-moving pulse of the nightlife and the post-club comedown.Salt’s highest points happen when the band’s impressive textures shape tuneful, easy-to-grasp songs, providing a lovely counterpoint to lead vocalist Andrea Estella’s millennial musings on digital desensitization, the melting pot of global culture, and the ills of consumerism. “Jaipur” thrums steadily beneath Estella’s commanding voice, fluttering woodwinds creating a fine mist around her. “Tops and Bottoms” pairs her introspective musings on fashion, body image, and the pressures of existing in public over a bed of brittle rhythms and luscious keyboards, while propulsive opener “Keep on Mixing” fashions hyperspeed pop from a skipping beat that suggests UK Garage and 2step.Such conventions have become the reference points of copyists during the last decade, but Mr Twin Sister synthesize them differently, crafting distinct moods around them in a manner that feels out-of-step with indie trendspotting. The production throughout is astounding, especially when considering Mr Twin Sister’s modest beginnings. The details are vivid in the mix, like the saxophone curlicue that rolls into the piano-and-drums arrangement of “Alien FM” or the horns that burst forth in “Taste in Movies.”Although Mr Twin Sister’s first release preceded chillwave, they gained prominence around the time the micro-movement took hold through the likes of Toro Y Moi and Neon Indian. Mr Twin Sister were briefly but incorrectly tagged this way, too, which made less sense as the band established their own genre-amorphous identity. But Mr Twin Sister have always been more than capable in establishing vibes, the essential quality of chillwave’s otherwise-nebulous form. On Salt, they’re sometimes too good at mood-setting music. The rippling, Vocalcity-like textures of slow-burning tracks such as “Deseo” and “Set Me Free” are just two of several instances that sound immaculate but offer little melodically except wispy atmospherics. But over-scrutinizing Mr Twin Sister’s capacity for vibe-setting feels like witnessing a rare bird in its natural habitat: attempting to examine them any closer risks disrupting the simple joy of watching them exist."

Luckily, they've never really tested me. I was less keen on Nocturama than most of the rest of Nick Cave's catalog, and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's latest threw me a little-- but there was enough virtue in each record to keep me enthralled by their respective franchises. Bowie repeatedly disappoints me nowadays, but I have reconciled this by imagining two distinct Bowies, one on either side of the 80s. Salt, however, has me reassessing everything Arto Lindsay's ever released, the extent to which I ever really loved him, and whether I need to forgive him, too.Lindsay's always been irreverent of the mainstream, unscrupulously dipping in and out of pop. The public has held his work in fittingly whimsical regard, as a given release might briefly capture the zeitgeist, only for the next to follow less relevant tangents. Lindsay flirts with avant-rock and pop, never fully subscribing to a genre, though an enduring affair with bossa nova colors most of his work. Reminiscent of a youthful Leonard Cohen about to lose himself entirely in listless day-dreaming, Lindsay has always let his soft, elusive vocals glisten like a layer of honey over their contained melodies.Salt, much in step with Lindsay's more recent mode, recalls neither his ""fake jazz"" combo The Lounge Lizards, nor his dance/noise project Ambitious Lovers-- and it's a long, long way from the no-wave DNA project that he began with back in 1978. Instead, it carries forth the Brazilian electronic theme instilled during Lindsay's mid-90s experiments with such artists as Vinicius Cantauria. ""Twins"" typifies this approach, pairing loose world and trip-hop flavored beats with glitchy electronics and recalling that era's The Subtle Body LP.What disappoints here, compared to, say, 2002's Invoke, is a conspicuous distance between Lindsay's sexually charged and insightful lyrics and their rightful musical home. You get the feeling that the vocal tracks could be indiscriminately swapped between songs and you'd never notice. On ""Kamo (Dark Stripe)"", Arto's Mick Hucknall-esque croon drifts meaninglessly on the technically proficient yet bland and subdued backing. Too many songs go by unnoticed, polished to such a blinding sheen that their surfaces reflect little discernable color or character.The album isn't without its pleasant moments, though. ""Into Shade"" is subtle and delicate, melting into gorgeous strings and perfectly restrained guitar phrasing. Here, Lindsay's voice interacts fully with the instrumentation rather than floating somewhere nearby in ponderous detachment. ""Personagem"" is a rich bossa nova excursion dotted with clever melodic interludes and an infectious, recurring guitar riff. The album rotates around ""Jardim da Alma"" (or ""Garden of the Soul""), a cluttered but accomplished amalgamation of Lindsay's transcontinental influences.Salt does some disservice to Lindsay's progression without entirely disgracing it. There's ample prettiness here to ensure second and third listens, but this will be no one's favorite Arto Lindsay album. As the music flickers with poise and confidence, the vocals fail to emote the seductive implications of Lindsay's words. Maybe it's this lack of cohesion that ""De Lama Lamina"" descends into squawky discordance to protest. Although Salt is mixed, frustrating, and hardly reflects the twenty-odd years Lindsay spent getting here, it's a peccadillo amidst an otherwise admirable legacy. Guess I'll be back for more after all."

The year off not only gave overtaxed fans a chance to replenish their bank accounts, it allowed the hard-working Carney boys a little time to consider their next move. Though by no means a ""comeback"" record, their latest, Innocence, does have a whiff of rejuvenation about it. Innocence serves up to-the-point southern-tinged hard-rock without one iota of pretense; you could call it the most accessible Pontiak record to date, and the Carneys would be inclined to agree.In Pontiak's case, however, accessibility leads them down a limited path. As Grayson Currin wrote in his review of 2009's Maker, Pontiak do well by ""bending elemental rock'n'roll into warped shapes… [while] putting the song at the center of the conquest."" Pontiak's always been at their best when they're not just kicking out the jams, but by weirding them up, bringing their exploratory tendencies to bear on their amp-destroying sideburns-and-beer-runs riffage. Jamming 11 songs into barely half an hour, the unusually compact Innocence doesn't give Pontiak much chance to stretch out. Trading off between rowdy, riff-crazy, tricked-out-Astrovan rockers and ambling, lighter-flicking balladry, Innocence is a classic Friday night ridearound record. But, with one too many momentum-killing ballads and a riff or two that plod as much as they push, the leaner, occasionally meaner Innocence finds the once-daring Pontiak a couple bongloads shy of a breakthrough.Innocence's opening trio is, by some distance, its finest stretch. The title track is a smoker, a lurching, pummeling, axis-shifting grove that piledrives its way directly through your skull. After a couple well-earned ""woos,"" ""Lack Lustre Rush"" breaks into a snarly, Southern-fried riff equally suitable for radio and your next blunt ride. A searing space-rocker in the Hawkwind tradition, ""Ghosts"" is a blast, built around long-trail afterburner vocals and a choppy, out-of-nowhere solo. These songs just sound good: taut, punchy, gripping, bite-sized brawlers. If only the same could be said of the next three songs: organ-driven sidewinder ""It's the Greatest,"" countryfied ""Tuesday's Gone""-jocking ballad ""Noble Heads"", and brothers-in-arms shuffler ""Wildfires"". Taken on their own, these are fine—if fairly forgettable—tunes, the kind of thing that have been peppering hard-rock records like Innocence for a good four decades now. Taken together, though, they carve out a considerable mid-LP crater, sapping any and all momentum built by Innocence's hard-driving opening in a fashion it never quite recovers from.Mercifully, Innocence's back half does what it can to right the wrongs of its strangely sequenced opening run. Though the proggy ""Shining"" stumbles a bit before finding its groove, most everything else—the Sabbath-conjuring ""Surrounded by Diamonds,"" the spacey ""Beings of the Rarest"", and the skull-splitting closer ""We've Got It Wrong""—hits the mark. Still, to get all the way to ""Wrong,"" you'll have to drag yourself through the dreary ""Darkness is Coming"", another undercooked, oversung go-nowhere energy-drainer that never quite seems to settle on a hook. Without these stragglers, Innocence would be wall-to-wall riffage. But these slower songs aren't just mellow, they're mundane, and their inclusion leaves Innocence feeling lopsided, a oft-killer rock record with nasty balladry habit."

On Body Language, Connections' smart, exceedingly catchy second LP of the year, frontman Kevin Elliott explores what it's like to be down-and-out on the cusp of drinking age.","They may already be tired of hearing it, but-- like any casually triumphant, fidelity challenged Buckeye State rockers-- comparisons between Columbus' Connections and Ohio lo-fi legends Guided by Voices seem all but inevitable. Both bands have a fondness for flooding the marketplace with new material: by the time we're through with 2013, Connections will add a third LP to their catalog. Hell, frontman Kevin Elliott even finds himself singing with the slightest whiff of a British accent, a trademark Pollardism that, as Pitchfork's Aaron Leitko wrote of this spring's Private Airplane, suggests more than a little time spent kneeling at the altar of Bee Thousand. But, while GBV's best songs spoke of rock'n'roll as a galvanizing force, a source of salvation-- ""I shoot myself with rock'n'roll,"" Bob Pollard sang on ""I Am a Scientist"", but ""nothing else can set me free""-- Connections seem to see it as a way to hold themselves together in the face of everyday chaos.On Body Language, Connections' second LP on the year, Elliott explores what it's like to be down-and-out on the cusp of drinking age. The people in Connections' songs are old enough to know better but young enough not to care all that much; their romantic ideas about love and life have started to crumble, but they're still not quite sure how to fill that gap. So they crash on couches, punch timeclocks, and hate the friends they keep falling for. ""I know you're aimless,"" he sings on the set's first song; later, it's ""I take it fuckin' easy."" The consequences of all that taking it easy, all those ""dreams that turn to embarrassment,"" have only just started to set in. But to these slackers, inertia's a killer; it's easier to promise yourself you'll wake up and do better than to actually get up and do it. Body Language doesn't wallow in these feelings, but it certainly speaks to them, and if you've ever woken up hungover with your neck draped across some half-stranger's sectional sofa, you're liable to see yourself somewhere in these songs.Musically, Body Language offers considerably more uplift. Like GBV, they're as scrappy as they are stirring; they stumble into bridges and gallop through choruses, throwing an extra chord in wherever it'll fit without bogging down the songs' forward motion, barely letting one song end before they careen into the next.

Mascis-style leads take a frontseat here, to the benefit of everybody; not only does he have Mascis' tone down cold, but he's got that same combination of reserve and abandon, that ability to inject genuine emotion into a cluster of notes. Highlights are everywhere: the casually exuberant ""Summer Creeps"" nicks the chords from Semisonic's ""Closing Time"" and a couple lines from Tom Petty's ""Last Dance With Mary Jane"" to pay tribute to another wasted season, but not before he spits out the punky ""Girl's Night Out"" like a stomach full of cheap vodka quickly curdling in his stomach. Every melody's sharp, some even border on regal. But Connections tear through each one of them with slacker's nonchalance, as if banging out a song as good and pure as ""Blurry Eyes"" is just no big deal.""They didn't plan much—just an escape route, and a sweet follow through,"" Elliott sings on ""Jeni and Johnny"", the story of two go-nowhere kids who decide they might just be born to run after all. If Connections have a mission statement, it's probably that: they don't, at first, seem like the get-up-and-go types, but when push comes to shove, they've got all the drive and determination they need. For a certain strain of indie rocker, Body Language is pure catnip. But it's more than that: a smart, stupendously catchy, often downright inspiring examination of the things that get us going in spite of ourselves, set to one head-stick melody after the other."

While you can get the gist of their concert experience from breathless online reports and YouTube clips, suffice to say, if you don't want to be covered in more than a few bodily fluids, lift musicians and their equipment in the air with your hands as they play, see flames leap from cymbals (an old trick that's still pretty dangerous), and stare into the hoary pockmarked face of rock'n'roll itself, then whatever you do, don't go see Monotonix live. So when it comes to their records, short of the CD spitting on you the moment you crack open the case, it's gonna fall short.That said, the band's debut EP is an inspired slab of no-frills, no-nonsense guitar rock that stands in the shadow of vintage metal while stretching out for a few genuine surprises. For a band that names one of its songs ""No Metal"", Body Language sure has its share of palm-muted and bottom-heavy riffs, charmingly over-the-top vocals, and even ominous, maniacal laughter on ""Deadly Weapon"". Metal is definitely part of the record's appeal-- most especially for those singeing opening notes of ""Summers and Autumns""-- but that's not where it ends. Monotonix certainly nods to a few hip hard-rock influences, from Sabbath to ZZ Top to maybe even a little early Iron Maiden, but there's more to it than that. They're far more fluid than most two-man guitar/drums lineups, as guitarist Yonatan Gat slides in and out of solos without ever throwing the rhythm off the rails. There's serious synergy between him and drummer Ran Shimoni as the latter underlines every whim of the guitar on ""Summers and Autumns"" while and anchoring every stop-on-dime turn, and maintains this grasp from the sleek and relatively straightforward riffery of ""Deadly Weapon"" to the go-nuttery guitar of ""No Metal"".""Body Language"" has the most headbanging rhythm and conspicuous guitar licks on the EP, but it also throws in a cascading piano riff over the song's tricky turnaround that goes a long way to color the track, and keeps the record itself from getting too homogeneous. The descending guitar line that follows is sweet and yearning enough to fit onto a damn Strokes record; It's a hell of a hodgepodge that makes its four minutes seem epic, and it all flows seamlessly. Singer Ami Shalev navigates every turn with an exaggerated croon that can taunt, plead, and terrify as the situation demands. The EP stands up as a whole, but it's these kids of details that bode well for future releases that could do more than lure listeners to the band's stage show. As it is, this is a promising start."

The group features drummer Tomas Barfod, whose 2012 album Salton Sea gave him a kind of name recognition that, at least in the States, the band itself has yet to achieve.","The Copenhagen 3-piece WhoMadeWho open their fifth album, Dreams, with a pair of über-saccharine songs, each a kind of lyrical equivalent of the ""Bound 2"" video’s backdrop, dispensed without a hint of irony. “There’s a heart that beats inside of me,” the group sings on the title track’s opening couplet. “Where the time flies, and the stars shine.” The songs are artfully composed, and after a couple of listens, they lodge in your head and stay there. But there’s just no getting over that initial impression, the lyrics representing the most prominent of several small flaws that undermine an otherwise solid record.Thankfully, the strength of the melodies eventually overwhelms the distractions. Though easily nauseated listeners may have trouble sticking around for ""The Morning"", it’s the first track that, even upon an initial listen, is able to transcend its lyrics. That’s partially due to a delightful falsetto from bassist Tomas Høffding. But the song is also a beautifully structured slab of pop, built upon the back of grooving bass and a genuinely stirring chorus, and punctuated by some well-chosen guitar chords. “Another Day” also finds the band in a zone, aping Alex Kapranos’ swagger over some distinctly Franz Ferdinand-esque disco-rock.Though their songwriting may indicate otherwise, WhoMadeWho have a substantial résumé.  They’re an experimental power-pop group, and have toured with LCD Soundsystem, Daft Punk, and Hot Chip amongst others. The latter band is the one they most resemble—the two share the same kind of lurid, almost hyperbolic, pop sensibility, and the Danes are similarly informed by both dance and electronic music, though they also boast the jazz background of the singer/guitarist, Jeppe Kjellberg.Dreams represents a kind of return for the band. Long thought to be hyper-talented underachievers, as famous for what they could be accomplishing as for what they were, the group straightened up with the 2012 album Brighter, leaving behind their more radical leanings for a clean pop sound*.* The record certainly showed that the band had an ability to get serious, but it also left some wanting the old experimental WhoMadeWho. Dreams, with its ability to shuffle through genres while maintaining a cohesive sound, should please though who were looking for a little more ambition.WhoMadeWho are blessed to have amongst their ranks the drummer Tomas Barfod, whose 2012 album Salton Sea gave him a kind of name recognition that, at least here in the States, the band itself has yet to achieve. (He recently released another EP, Pulsing.) Barfod’s influence is obvious on Dreams, particularly in the tight-locked drumming that drives standout “Indian Summer”, one of the most natural-sounding tracks here.But even with all that’s going for it, the album never quite manages to reach equilibrium.  Every so often, the band’s facility with the lighter sides of rock devolves into a kind of disco schmaltz. That's the problem with ""Traces,"" which, stuffed as it with offbeat ideas, like droning psychedelic synths and a fake-out bridge, still comes off as vanilla. Then too, there's always the worry that the absurdity of the writing will interrupt the flow, as on ""Hiding in Darkness"", a too-short disco anthem that turns faux-profound as it considers all the possibilities that darkness affords.For the most part, Dreams is filled with danceable, catchy music. But when a band—even one with a dance background—attempts to make an album powered by dynamite pop songs, the songs have to be airtight. WhoMadeWho are hovering on the edge of something big—they have all the talent and creativity required to make innovative pop. But with Dreams, they’re just not quite there yet, again."

Contestants from around the globe (the middle latitudes, at least) battle in a series of events designed to judge the breadth and depth of their Caucasianness, facing off in contests like Quickest Sunburn, Jumping Inability, Lack of Rhythm, Star Trek Fan-Fiction Writing, NASCAR Identification Quiz, and, of course, hockey.Apparently I missed the season where Erlend Øye won the coveted golden-golf-ball belt of The Whitest Boy Alive, but apparently the musician is proud enough of his accomplishment to have named his latest project after the award. It's no surprise that Øye was such a formidable candidate; after all, he hails from notorious WBA powerhouse country Norway, and despite being quite poor in the Lack of Rhythm competition, his Nordic skin resembles an Atomic Fireball with the most miniscule of sunlight exposure, and he looks like he'd be an encyclopedia of TNG-era Trek facts.Øye's pride in his title might fool you into thinking the Whitest Boy Alive is, as the name would indicate, some kind of tee-hee ironic white-kid rap project; thankfully, it's not. After making delicate whisper-folk as half of the Kings of Convenience, a collaborative electronic solo record, and rechristening himself ""The Singing DJ"" for a well-received DJ-Kicks set, Øye now takes the step of making electric music, ""rock,"" for lack of any better term. Hewing close to the soft side of the genre, Dreams presents a sound that invokes every Scandinavian stereotype not yet broached by this review: socialism-clean, winter-wind crisp, expensive-sounding, and unfailingly polite.Like the similarly fussy Phoenix, Øye applies each element of his four-piece band with obsessive meticulousness, creating a tight, rhythmic sound that is so unfunky it comes back around to funky again. Reflective of his DJ set's taste for Kompakt-style glossy house, TWBA's drumming is metronomic and efficient, while the bass, guitar, and keyboards gently entwine with drill-team precision, imagining if Kraftwerk had produced Fleetwood Mac.Whether you find this winterfresh concoction to be electrifying or sedative depends on your temperament, or your thoughts on previous Øye work; all the new-fangled amplification doesn't do much to raise the singer's library-voice volume. Øye attempts to mix things up by indulging a heretofore unknown taste for guitar solos, nothing too flashy, but still providing a bit of fang on an otherwise toothless record. When the guitar spotlights are kept at a messy-chord rhythm-guitar level (as on ""Burning"", or the nicely inverted progression of ""Inflation""), they're satisfying, like intentionally making a mess of a neat freak's kitchen counter. When the solos turn to extended vamps, as on ""Down with You"", they only magnify the music's hypnotic qualities, for better or worse (mostly worse). Elsewhere, on ""Above You"", Øye tries to animate his stiff sound with playful keyboards: a crunchy clavinet that successfully adds some strut, and a bloopy synth that ruins the strut by making it sound like they're jamming with R2D2.Still, despite the stylistic embellishments, Øye can't completely escape his now well-established persona; that same restrained voice, those same detached melodies, the same room left for silence, no matter whether it's set against folk, electronic, or rock trappings. There's still life left in that formula, but transferring it from genre to genre must be getting exhausting-- Øye himself sounds a bit groggy by the drum-less closer ""All Ears"". The taut, prim pop of Dreams does revitalize Øye's approach for a time, but by the end of the album the novelty is somewhat lost, a promising sound extinguished by the singer's refusal to expand his vocal horizons. Blame it on a conflict of interest: The Whitest Boy Alive contest frowns upon excessive displays of vocal exuberance, and its champion and house band are obligated to comply."

""Jazz is dead as a popular art form,"" was the comprise I agreed to, wincing all the while, in a recent exchange with a conscientious objector. I'm not sure I totally agree with that statement, but it was the only way to make my point of jazz's continued relevance without conceding that it is, at best, an interesting sideshow to the popular, rocky main attractions.Yet, jazz is vibrant, as long as you're willing to flip past the Billboard top 40 jazz records and delve into the 'marginal' sides of truly new music. The biggest problem I see with jazz is not in its unfamiliarity to most rock listeners, or even with the art's own hardliner traditionalists (paging Mr. Marsalis, Mr. Marsalis, please pick up a white courtesy phone)-- the greatest hurdle for jazz is that it's seen as antiquated, eccentric dinner party music; something to take a few samples of so it can make your record collection look nice, and prove that you ""gave it a chance.""That's a shame, because a lot's happened to jazz since Kind of Blue and A Love Supreme. In the case of Otomo Yoshihide, you might even be hard-pressed to call it 'jazz' at all. Where the crusty old regime might lead you to believe that swing beats and long, wanky sax solos were required, this incredible Japanese experimentalist forgoes the traditional for the extreme, post modern and ironic. In many ways, Otomo is similar to American John Zorn, though rather than flighty sax skronks and hardcore backdrops, he favors the turntable, the guitar, and the raw, romantic impressionism of free jazz. Of the literally hundreds of releases he's been involved with, the most famous was his legendary avant-rock collective Ground Zero (sort of a more colorful, Japanese version of Zorn's Naked City). His New Jazz Ensemble, which plays here, features many of the same musicians, but makes a jazz noise where GZ rocked.Dreams is Yoshihide's second record with his jazz band, though the first was billed as the New Jazz Quintet. The first record saw Yoshihide struggling to strike a balance between modern electronic improvisation and traditional hard bop. This one is altogether different, most notably due to the presence of female vocals, provided by Phew and Togawa Jun. Phew is no stranger to fans of experimental Japanese music, and her earthy voice turns many tunes that would be straight-ahead jazz ballads into introspective tone poems. Jun, meanwhile, doesn't quite possess Phew's command of atmosphere, but adds a less weighty compliment to the music nonetheless."

When the pandemic began, she decamped to her family’s home in Maine, where she reconnected with nature and wrote a collection of songs called Surrender—which is also the name of her 2022 Harvard Divinity School thesis. Oh yeah: While working on the follow-up to her 2019 debut Heard It in a Past Life, Rogers was enrolled in a year-long masters program focused on the presence of religion in public life. For the 28-year-old singer-scholar that meant considering questions like: Does an artist hold a responsibility to their audience? And how can performance be a conduit for a transcendental experience?If it sounds a little Ivy League Hannah Montana—finals by day, Met Gala by night—Rogers’ return to academia served her well. On Surrender, she sounds renewed, submitting to the pull of her heart without apology. She plays hooky from adulthood on the upbeat “Be Cool” and gives into her carnal instincts on “Want Want”; she’s turning off the radio and listening to the wind instead of suffering through “that song I’m supposed to know/By some fucking bro,” as she teases on “Anywhere With You.” She’s still processing her whirlwind rise to fame, and learning what to prioritize: “Took me all this long to figure out/It’s not worth it/If I can’t touch the ground,” she sings on the ballad “Horses,” which uses the titular animals as a symbol for the freedom she so badly desires.The album itself reflects Rogers’ newfound autonomy: She’s trimmed back on her debut’s stable of producers, co-producing Surrender herself alongside Kid Harpoon (Harry Styles, Shawn Mendes). One of the best moments, the escapist fantasy “Anywhere With You,” was co-written with an old friend, Holden Jaffe, who makes music under the name Del Water Gap (Rogers performed in an earlier version of the project while in college). On the song, Rogers lifts a companion out of their existential malaise before the pair hit the road in search of something bigger than themselves. Like so many road songs, it’s also a declaration of devotion, a commitment to journeying forward together even as their thoughts on forever differ: “You tell me you want everything you want it fast,” Rogers bellows atop a cathartic crescendo that would not sound out of place on an early Arcade Fire record. “But all I’ve ever wanted is to make something/Fucking last.”"

Maybe last year's DJ mix album, the reasonably decent Brothers Gonna Work It Out, should have been the clue, but Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons have clearly been raiding a library- sized record collection since their last offering of ""original"" music.""Music: Response,"" the album's leadoff, starts like a ride on the Autobahn with Kraftwerk circa the mid '70s, with its analog synth blips and monotone computerwelt voices, before tossing in some ferocious beats to bring Krautrock into the new millennium. The mood carries through on ""Under the Influence"" with more Kraftwerk- styled noodlings. Meanwhile, their best instrumental effort is ""The Sunshine Underground,"" an eight- and- a- half minute ride through chiming tones, wafting flute- like sounds, and sputtering and gurgling synths that intertwine with the briefest of dreamy vocals. Actually, it wouldn't have been out of place on the last Orbital album.Surrender will receive a ton of hype based on its superstar guest appearances, and none more historically relevant than ""Out of Control"" with New Order's Bernard Sumner on vocals. Being electronic dance music freaks from Manchester, New Order is like the holy grail to the Chemical Brothers and it's easy to see why. The Chemicals share with their Manchester predecessors an obsession with hypnotic, melodic, dance beats. ""Out of Control"" works so well it could be a lost track from Low Life. After his turn on ""Setting Son"" with the Chemicals in 1996, Oasis' terminally out- of- style Noel Gallagher returns for another psychedelic, Beatles-esque anthem on ""Let Forever Be,"" again snagging the rhythm track from ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" off Revolver.Surrender is both the Chemical Brothers most immediately satisfying work and, perhaps not coincidentally, the most like a rock album of their career. Unlike a fair share of techno, these songs feel like ""songs,"" not a collection of clever samples and a race to the fastest BPM on the planet. Yeah, you can go out and buy your jungle, your trance, your trip-hop and your ambient, but why would you when you'd be sacrificing the greatest gift of all: Surrender's love and understanding."

Today, we revisit an album that changed ambient music forever.","The facts were thin on the ground. Richard D. James was from Cornwall, yes—a geographical outsider in the context of early-1990s UK rave, a kind of coastal cowpoke. He’d been at college for an engineering degree, one he never finished, and was known to pick at the innards of his analog synths. He collected aliases like another young man might sneakers, trotting each one out when the occasion called for it, never letting any of them get too worn: Polygon Window, Caustic Window, Power-Pill, the Dice Man, GAK, Blue Calx, Q-Chastic, AFX, plus his clear favorite, Aphex Twin.James claimed to sleep just two hours a night; claimed, too, that he could control his dreams, even wrote much of his music in his sleep. He is said to have gotten the jackhammering sounds for “Quoth” from a day job digging tunnels. Did he really drive a decommissioned tank? And as for the bit about being named after his dead brother, you kind of didn’t even want to know. Some people swore he’d cried in interviews, talking about his perished namesake sibling; others were sure it was part of the long con.Try as you might, you couldn’t quite separate fact from fantasy, or figure out where the truth ended and the fib began. James thrived on ambiguity, possessing a gaslighting nature, David Toop wrote in his 1996 book Ocean of Sound, that “indicates either a serious person who has never been taken seriously or a practical joker who has been taken seriously for way too long.”I don’t think James ever made anything up maliciously; I think he just liked to talk, to amuse himself, to keep himself from getting bored in the endless parade of interviews a rising star gets subjected to. It’s no wonder an ornery young artist, a prodigy, really, might tell a gullible journalist that, by his 20th birthday, he’d completed 1000 songs, enough to fill 100 albums. No matter how tall the tales grew around this Cornish Paul Bunyan, none of them ever came close to eclipsing the music itself.James emerged in 1991, at 20 years old, just as UK producers were scrambling to keep up with the newfound domestic demand for electronic dance music. The sound was born in Chicago and Detroit in the mid-1980s and imported to the UK in 1987 when a handful of London DJs stumbled upon acid, the musical style—along with ecstasy, the chemical compound—while on holiday in Ibiza. Their horizons instantly broadened, they connived to bring the stuff back home, and wham: a canary-yellow smiley face landed upon fair Albion like a pallet of rations air-dropped by a benevolent conqueror. Within a few short months, trend-happy (and MDMA-happy) England was consumed with the fever for all things house and techno, but it soon became clear that America simply wasn’t producing enough of the stuff to keep up with British ravers’ ravenous appetites."

He is an acknowledged inheritor of Miles Davis and Teo Macero's experiments in electric jazz and studio-aided collage composition, and yet the ambient nature of his work often lands his discs in the new age racks. Hassell studied with Stockhausen and Pandit Pran Nath, played on the first recording of Terry Riley's In C, and collaborated with the likes of La Monte Young, Talking Heads, David Sylvian, and Ry Cooder. He's also the inventor of something he calls Fourth World, ""a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques""-- a phrase that's hard to shake free, in 2009, of associations with Putumayo compilations, or Burning Man. It's difficult to think of another contemporary jazz musician whose reputation encompasses such opposing poles: conceptual rigor on the one hand; easy listening on the other.Hassell's new album, Last Night the Moon Came Dropping Its Clothes in the Street, does in fact make for easy listening-- profoundly warm, immersive, relaxing listening. It's electric-blanket music, isolation-tank music, lucid-dreaming music that moves as assuredly as if by the power of your own suggestion. I've been tempted to call it ""yoga for the mind,"" except that the phrase sounds way too glib, too slack, for music this rigorous. But it's also a puzzle, a non-Euclidean rendering sourced from small-ensemble sessions and recomposed via digital editing. It's as hard to separate out the music's discrete pieces as it is to discern between its structure and sense of drift.Much of the album's pleasures are immediate and visceral. This is as sumptuous as ""ambient"" music gets. The album opens with a glowing song, ""Aurora"", that sounds exactly like its title suggests, with scratchy, glowing drones of uncertain provenance taking on a daybreak shine as Hassell's trumpet rises like a heat mirage in echoing, overlapping lines; there's a faint echo of dub in the bass. ""Time and Place"" is slow, spelunking funk, descending ropey bass lines through chambers where ambient shimmer illuminates melodic figures as lifelike as cave drawings: bluegrass violin, panting organs, and of course Hassell's reverberant horn melodies, which slide around the edges of the song's key signature, highlighting its contours in slippery relief. A dubby pulse echoes the percussive rattle of Hassell's Earthquake Island and, on a more contemporary note, the Moritz von Oswald Trio's Vertical Ascent, which might not be surprising, given that von Oswald has professed his admiration for Hassell's work. The track leads almost seamlessly into ""Abu Gil"", where violin and electric keys blow its modal structure wide open. One of the album's centerpieces, the 13-minute song is grounded in more loping percussion and a pinging bass line that wobbles like a taut clothesline; Hassell's trumpet is refracted through delays and a harmonizer effect, throwing shadows in fourths and fifths as it slinks, catlike, around the changes."

In 2003 he was releasing an abundance of music, including further volumes of his Disintegration Loops. This record was released in that year as well, and listening to it now, over 10 years after it originally surfaced, it feels like a natural successor to his best-known work. The mechanics behind it are similar; Basinski returned to the same source material used for The Disintegration Loops—a series of tape loops he’d made in the 1980s—to again discover a rich sound world in the degraded patterns that emerged.Basinski was working in microscopic detail on these pieces, essentially using a method that picked at infinitesimal pieces of sound to see where they would lead him. Something that ties it to The Disintegration Loops, aside from the core operating principle, is the way he uses small movements to express larger feelings. If his preceding work was overwhelmingly about death, Melancholia sees hope approaching in its aftermath. It’s an album split into tracks, although it’s almost impossible to regard it as such, especially as it’s easy to pin a narrative on it when tiny pin-pricks of light rip through the surface in its backend.This reissue of Melancholia, gorgeously packaged on high quality vinyl by the always interesting Temporary Residence, goes some way to advancing its reputation. It’s the type of record that deserves this kind of treatment in order to get the most out of it, making it easier to sink into the feelings of concern, threat, faith, and belief that are suggested as Basinski delicately plods through this world. The arcing piano motifs are reminiscent of Harold Budd’s collaboration with Brian Eno on The Plateaux of Mirror—an album released in the same decade as Basinski’s source material, and one that shares its sense of dysphoria morphing into optimism.Occasionally Melancholia drops like a lead weight, with darker transmissions emerging just as set patterns threaten to take hold. “Melancholia XIII” is the most effective of these; sequenced as the penultimate track to the album, it works as a subtle reminder of the ills in Basinski’s world, even if he does appear to be on a slow, upward trajectory during everything that surrounds the track. “Melancholia VII” is an earlier downturn in mood, highlighting how well he suggests struggle in his work—here, it feels like the ghostly loops are last gasp remnants of some dying planet, struggling to make one final broadcast before the darkness overwhelms.Something this album toys with occasionally is a wistful, almost folky kind of ambience. On “Melancholia IX” Basinski gets tangled up in the kind of atmosphere that lutist Jozef Van Wissem occasionally inhabits, where the sense of sadness is underpinned by a rustic air, giving it the feel of a place that’s centuries old. It’s a key reason why Basinski’s work can resonate so hard—the tools he uses may be modern, but the feeling he foments in his work is positively ancient. It makes the slow movement through Melancholia instantly relatable on a very human, almost primordial level, like looking at an old cave painting and realizing how much of it reflects our current identity."

The piece, which opens with wispy synths that give way to glowing orbs of sound that dart about in interlocking shapes, is engrossing in the same way watching an incoming storm can be; it provokes constant anticipation, the complex swirl impossible to take in all at once.Barbieri’s music reflects a longstanding interest in the tension between the mechanical and the emotional, how one can blur or melt into the other. It’s a quality that many of the contributors here miss, and Fantas Variations loses the metaphysical wonder of her work. The collection is split between musicians arranging the piece for various instruments and electronic musicians attempting to translate the piece for the dancefloor. Though each artist accentuates something unique, there is something lost in nearly every single adaptation.Several of the most compelling arrangements on Fantas Variations are the ones that stray furthest from the original. Saxophonist Bendik Giske hypnotic version zeroes in on one specific, repetitive pattern and gradually builds on top of it, the clicking sound of the keys audible on top of distant, wordless vocals. Kali Malone’s arrangement for two organs does away with hyperspeed counterpoint, molding the basic chord progression into her characteristically slow-motion slabs of sound.While these, as well as Evelyn Saylor’s adaptation for four voices, use “Fantas” as a jumping-off point, others, including electric guitarist Walter Zenetti and producer Carlo Maria (who recreates the piece using Roland TR-808 and MC-202 units), offer flattened adaptations that sound imitative in comparison. On the other end of the spectrum are jarring, awkward remixes by the typically brilliant Nyege Nyege affiliate Jay Mitta and LA-based producer Baseck, both of whom dial up the BPM and end up obliterating the piece’s nuance and delicacy.The album ends with “Fantas Morbida,” an abbreviated, sparse variation for solo piano by Kara-Lis Coverdale. It boils the piece down to its essence, a pensive melodic line that glides over an open, syncopated arpeggio, reminiscent of the gorgeous piano interludes on Aphex Twin’s Drukqs. After nearly an hour of variations on the same theme, hearing that refrain laid bare feels like a rebirth, finally bringing the piece’s emotional impact into focus. The mechanics of the piano are simpler than those of the synthesizer, the human behind the music more immediately apparent. It’s a reminder that even when aided by machines and algorithms, human minds and human emotions give music meaning and power.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

While he started out in the early 1990s as a jingle writer in São Paulo before moving to rock production and performing, his subsequent move to techno was motivated primarily by the desire for control: He wanted to be able to run his own studio from his living room. And control he did: Chromophobia, his 2007 breakthrough on Kompakt, evangelized the steady bass pulse and austere dissonance of contemporary techno within the context of inviting, discrete songs. In 2007 Boratto and Axel Willner, aka the Field, mixed a powerful serum of pop-aware techno. They posited consumer-friendly full-length albums that appealed to rock listeners skeptical about dance music's extreme repetition and track-driven culture.Take My Breath Away, the follow-up, folds the cold abstractions of techno into the lyrical sheen of synth-pop. You can take the album's title any way you like-- a reference to the Top Gun Berlin jam, a mawkish platitude, or a winking jab at both. In any case, the record is quite different thematically from Chromophobia. The latter was an elemental evocation both aesthetic (reflecting Boratto's desire to expand his expressive palette) and political (""Chromophobia"" being a veiled reference to the racial and sexual tensions of the style). Cover art comparisons rarely do their subjects justice, but here it suffices: Boratto approached Chromophobia as an abstraction of design; Take My Breath Away is a living, breathing portrait painted in simple (maybe even simplistic) terms.For better or for worse, Take My Breath Away feels comfortable and content. Boratto battered Chromophobia opener ""Scene 1"" with skittering rhythms and gong-like bass revelations, pushing the mix so far in the red it almost knocked the track off its rhythmic foundation. ""Take My Breath Away"" purrs in comparison, winding up tension not via rhythmic interplay, but by the fact that he's actually playing it straight. Single ""Atomic Soda"" offers the same sort of view from 10,000 feet, playing like a streamlined mix of Chromophobia's ""The Blessing"" before burning into and re-constituting itself via glitchy beats in the breakdown. The lead synth lines on ""Colors"" and ""Azurra"" could have been cribbed off a ""Legend of Zelda"" game, but Boratto contextualizes them within a sentimentalized backdrop and sells them convincingly: they are discrete little packets of schmaltz.Fittingly, ""No Turning Back"", this record's standout track, reaches for the same heights of pop idolatry as Chromophobia's ""Beautiful Life"". Slower and kissed with cymbals from his drum machine's ""Rock"" kit, ""No Turning Back"" delivers on Boratto's unstated notion that techno's best grooves are really just rock riffs extended over longer time periods. Vocalist Luciana Villanova (Boratto's wife) also sang on ""Beautiful Life"", and her simple and divine verses again arrive pregnant with empty meaning. Yes, Boratto's loudest denial of techno strictures, smack dab in the middle of an album full of such denials, arrives in the form of a house music diva verse. The words themselves are so dull, they verge on parody; her voice is detached but holds dear to the song's platitudes as the siren-wail of guitars surrounds her, sublimely unexpected. It's one of the best songs of the year so far, but it may have delivered the final stroke in painting Boratto into his own corner of semi-serious banality. No turning back, indeed.Boratto once told Stylus Magazine of ""Beautiful Life"": ""There's that bassline at the end of the track-- well, I made a little joke. I was pretending to be like [New Order's] Peter Hook. It was just a little joke."" I never really believed that New Order jab was really a joke. Boratto's fluency with the pop music idiom informs his eloquence within the hard jargon of techno. But what really makes his work special is his ability to speak two musical languages at once without sounding like he's pandering to either side. His deliberate inflections of melody often emerge with a ring of truth, especially as he guides his repetitions through the peaks and valleys of his little mostly-nonverbal anecdotes. One gets the sense, however, that in acknowledging where his inspirations came from and figuring out where his compositions will go on Take My Breath Away, he's misplaced the present tense and the once-present tension."

It is a warm and delicate pop album about life as a young gay man.,"I’m willing to go out on a limb and say that Troye Sivan gets it. The Australian YouTuber-turned-pop star has all the qualifications you’d look for in a modern-day gay icon—a devoted army of long-time fans, elfin features, celebrities and designers on speed dial—and the good sense to recognize how meaningless and outmoded that kind of title is. “I just don’t represent everybody, because I’m extraordinarily lucky,” Sivan told British style magazine Another Man in May. “I come from a middle-class white family in Australia, and all of my dreams have come true by 22. I had the easiest coming out in the world… There are plenty of other people who need to be heard first.”Give him an opportunity, and he’ll happily rattle off the names of other musicians at the vanguard of queer representation: Sam Smith, Halsey, Kehlani, Perfume Genius, Kevin Abstract, Hayley Kiyoko. He invited Kim Petras on tour as an opening act and deftly handled the ensuing backlash over her work with Dr. Luke, making donations to the Ally Coalition and RAINN. His humility would feel performative and cynical if it weren’t so thorough. Blink and you might forget why Sivan is holding court on these topics in the first place: He’s an evolutionary artist, one whose existence and career is the product of decades of baby steps and boundary-pushing. Being gay is an integral and visible part of Sivan’s art, just as much as his voice or his choice of collaborators.Bloom, Sivan’s second studio album, is best described in terms you rarely see associated with male pop stars: delicacy, transparency, and vulnerability. He sings about experiences that are commonplace for young gay men in 2018 but feel totally transgressive in a broader pop context. He wrote opener “Seventeen” about sneaking onto Grindr with a fake ID and hooking up with older men, and the title track captures bottoming for the first time in all of its agony and ecstasy.The subject matter draws headlines, but it’s less revelatory than what’s between the lines. You can feel the power dynamics underpinning each of these songs shifting in unpredictable ways. Sivan starts both “Seventeen” and “Bloom” in a playful mood, teasing his partner, flirting, issuing commands. He’s an object of desire, and that puts him in control. “I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break,” he taunts on “Seventeen.” “Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me.” Just a few seconds later, he’s lost his footing: the older man he’s sought out for a virgin fling might not be so easy to manipulate in the heat of the moment. The “Bloom” pre-chorus is a nervous whimper—“I need you to tell me right before it goes down/Promise me you’ll hold my hand if I get scared now”—just before Sivan relaxes and enjoys the ride."

He’s a platonic doofus, a happy-go-lucky heel, and a distillation of Los Angeles’ most garish impulses. The canary-yellow Lamborghini shrieking through red lights on Sunset Boulevard? That’s Tyga. A pseudo-pensive pose on the glass-ringed balcony of a rented Hollywood Hills mansion, Instagram captioned: “it took alot of grindin to get here”? That’s Tyga. The guy in a gold backwards cap getting served legal papers at an L.A. Gear event? That, quite literally, is Tyga.It’s appropriate, then, that his latest career move is a preposterous one. Kyoto is a pleading, quasi-introspective R&B album by a rapper previously best known for unsubtle lyrics about his unyielding acquisitiveness—he gets laid, gets money, and gets high. Why the sudden change in tack? “The last five years of my life has been a lot of me in the media because of my relationships,” he recently told Billboard, presumably referring to his time with Blac Chyna and a youthful Kylie Jenner. “I can’t even go to the movies with a girl anymore. It’s a gift and a curse. I really wanted to step in front of the narrative and create my own story.”After 52 minutes of Kyoto, it remains unclear what that story is. Instead of addressing the alienating nature of celebrity, or the motivations for his romantic choices, or the past (and maybe necessary) falsity of his public persona, Tyga mostly opts for bad puns and shallow platitudes. On “Temperature,” a dancehall-style dud that recalls “1 of 1” from—sigh, deep breath—Bitch I’m The Shit 2, he intones in a half-assed patois, “I lost my watch and I still found time.” Or, on “Hard2Look” (more like “Hard2ListenTo,” amiright?), he sings, “I know this bustdown Patek won’t switch sides/I know this Lambo won’t switch sides/I know my true fans won’t switch sides.” Or, worse, on the hazy “King of the Jungle,” he admits, “I’ve been unfaithful/I’ve been lyin’ like the king of the jungle.”More obvious than its spiritual emptiness is the album’s somnambulance. As is de rigueur in contemporary R&B, Kyoto tries to pass off silken textures and washed-out vocal samples as sensual and vulnerable. But those sensual, vulnerable tones should, ideally, boil at some point into something with a burning immediacy. These songs don’t, and much of the album just sounds exhausted. These inert instrumentals don’t do Tyga any favors: He’s more of a melodic, vibing vocalist than an outright singer, and the sparseness only serves to highlight his limited range.Eventually, the yawning void of imagination at the center of Kyoto becomes downright oppressive. The album is nearly an hour of rote box-checking: two dancehall songs—check (“Temperature” and “Holdin On”); an EDM-inspired club track—check (“Leather in The Rain”); near-scandalous revelations about another celebrity, in this case Kylie Jenner—check (“King of the Jungle”); an A-list guest verse—check (Gucci Mane mails it in on “Sip A Lil”). I’ve seen more daring artistic flourishes on the walls of gas station bathrooms.Sadly, this album seems likely to generate a crossover hit or two. My predictions: “Temperature” is going to score the transfer of a communicable disease at a Las Vegas pool, and “Leather in the Rain” will ooze from tinny fitting-room speakers at fast fashion stores across the country. For a project with a sexualized cartoon cat-woman on the cover, recorded by an artist known for his horniness, the whole of Kyoto is, well, flaccid."

Then she split with Interscope and resurfaced on the indie circuit, carting Jay-Z and her sister Beyoncé to Grizzly Bear concerts on the Williamsburg waterfront and offering up a cover of Dirty Projectors' ""Stillness Is the Move"". At cynical first glance, it seemed like Knowles was simply backtracking and rebranding, hoping to claim some available indie turf. But this fall, she released ""Losing You"", a gleaming and spirited new song that transcended the labels she'd been assigned. Released via Terrible, the label co-owned by Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear, the sly single hinted at the possibilities open to an artist who eschews a traditional model of pop stardom. True, the EP that follows, delivers on the fresh promise of ""Losing You"" and marks the sound of a singer hitting a graceful stride, in her own time and on her own terms.Producers and songwriters in the pop world sometimes lurk in the background, leaving the vocalist to be the face of the project. But Solange upends that model by presenting Devonté Hynes, her co-songwriter and True’s main producer, as a full-fledged partner. His name is credited prominently and he appears hand-in-hand with Solange at listening parties and in press photos. And True, a thematically consistent whole, sounds like the product of a lovingly forged artistic bond. The EP shares DNA with Hynes' solo outlet Blood Orange. Like the best bits of his 2011 album Coastal Grooves, it feeds on humble but compulsively listenable tunes that reference the silken grooves of late-80s pop. But Hynes thrives in a supporting role. ""If there's a better voice [than mine] suited to a song-- I usually have a female voice in my head, anyway-- then I would rather her sing it,"" he told me during an interview earlier this year. ""It makes me happier.""Hynes has met an ideal female vocal muse in Solange, who executes each cut with simple grace and yearning naïveté. These songs often reconcile girlish optimism with worldly wisdom as though the two are one and the same. ""Maybe I lost you, but I was not done having my fun/ Played around with your heart, now I'm playing around in the dark,"" she apologizes on ""Lovers in the Parking Lot"". And on “Bad Girls”, she captures the uneasiness of waking up in last night's smeared makeup and feeling unmoored: ""I look down on you, so deep down I know that we're the same/ It's stupid thinking that you would want to come play my game,"" she sings, ending the EP over a twinkle worthy of a closing scene in an early John Hughes film.Like much of True, it's the sound of a complicated slow dance during a night's dwindling last minutes, fueled by pounding hearts and racing minds. The record never builds to a huge chorus; instead, its hooks bubble up quietly and quickly, then dissipate as the songs return to their downbeat simmer. Hynes tinkers with non-traditional structures, letting the tunes meander in and out of grooves, but while this occasionally causes True to fall slack (""Look Good With Trouble""), it’s a largely effective approach.True also benefits from its unorthodox length: At seven songs, it's fuller than most EPs, yet too short to be considered an album-album. Somehow, it works. Why add filler just to call it an album? It's another example of Knowles and Hynes forgoing conventional wisdom and doing things their own way. Seven songs can be the perfect length; a collection of accessible and authentic pop can come out on an indie label; you can reshape the typical producer/songwriter/pop star model; you can create unassuming music that still sounds like a big deal. And ultimately, for Solange, you can retrace your steps and find yourself somewhere entirely new."

The NYC band's lead singer, Jorge Elbrecht, was a founding member of the now-dormant ""art collective"" Lansing-Dreiden, who last signed off full-length-wise with 2006's murky, equally new wave and OMD-worshipping The Dividing Island. Violens' 2010 debut, Amoral, ditched the shadows and fog for pop-rock bounce and Boo Radleys impressions that were impressively faithful, if not totally memorable. For the band's follow-up, True, they've moved to perpetually in-vogue indie pop revivalist mecca Slumberland. In general, Elbrecht and his latest project haven't strayed too far from the same sonic mission announced circa L-D's excellent The Dividing Island cut ""Two Extremes"": All sonic roads still end shortly before Bill Clinton first took residence in the White House, the previous Echo and the Bunnymen comparisons joined here by takes on the jangly roar of first-wave shoegazers like Pale Saints, Slowdive, and Ride.Those slight changes in genre-based sound are the results of True being Violens' first true full-band effort, as the record's writing sessions began while the band's current lineup was touring behind Amoral. This turns out to be a boon, since True sounds more melodically pretty and dewy-eyed than its predecessor. If you're the ceiling-staring type that gets chills from just a few seconds of chiming guitar, or maybe a snatch of achingly sung vocals, this record might be just your thing. Undoubtedly, these simple pleasures seem all the more pleasurable because the bar's been lowered over the past few years when it comes to ""this kind of stuff,"" which gives True a whiff of ephemerality; on the other hand, ""enjoy it while you can"" doesn't seem like particularly terrible advice as long as you can, well, enjoy it.When I say ""this kind of stuff,"" I'm referring to the current and ongoing guitar-indie embrace of shoegaze-derived texture and feel, which wasn't very present in the sparkling clarity that Amoral wore like the prettiest nail polish. On True, that's been replaced by the kind of production touches you'd expect from a Slumberland release-- reverb, distanced vocals, guitars coated in a warm glow. Over the past few years, those things have become synonymous with representing guitar-focused indie music that's tagged as ""lo-fi,"" but there's not much about True that sounds home-recorded or shabby. As he did on Amoral, Elbrecht handled the production duties on True, and his able ear makes True less a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP and more of a studio professional's idea of what a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP would sound like. It's the small details, like the howling wind and bird cries that open ""Sariza Spring"" or the exquisitely applied layers of echo on closer ""So Hard to See"", that mark this album as a headphones listen.Here's why I hold some reservation against Violens: True shows that Elbrecht and his band are more than capable of recreating moments from the past in a way that is reverent and still provides pleasure to those who grew up listening to those past sounds and relative newbies alike. But I'm not so sure that they're good at doing much more than that. Violens seem to have hit their sweet spot here, though, so hopefully they'll continue drilling in the same place instead of looking for more history that's ripe for plundering."

Like the best bits of his 2011 album Coastal Grooves, it feeds on humble but compulsively listenable tunes that reference the silken grooves of late-80s pop. But Hynes thrives in a supporting role. ""If there's a better voice [than mine] suited to a song-- I usually have a female voice in my head, anyway-- then I would rather her sing it,"" he told me during an interview earlier this year. ""It makes me happier.""Hynes has met an ideal female vocal muse in Solange, who executes each cut with simple grace and yearning naïveté. These songs often reconcile girlish optimism with worldly wisdom as though the two are one and the same. ""Maybe I lost you, but I was not done having my fun/ Played around with your heart, now I'm playing around in the dark,"" she apologizes on ""Lovers in the Parking Lot"". And on “Bad Girls”, she captures the uneasiness of waking up in last night's smeared makeup and feeling unmoored: ""I look down on you, so deep down I know that we're the same/ It's stupid thinking that you would want to come play my game,"" she sings, ending the EP over a twinkle worthy of a closing scene in an early John Hughes film.Like much of True, it's the sound of a complicated slow dance during a night's dwindling last minutes, fueled by pounding hearts and racing minds. The record never builds to a huge chorus; instead, its hooks bubble up quietly and quickly, then dissipate as the songs return to their downbeat simmer. Hynes tinkers with non-traditional structures, letting the tunes meander in and out of grooves, but while this occasionally causes True to fall slack (""Look Good With Trouble""), it’s a largely effective approach.True also benefits from its unorthodox length: At seven songs, it's fuller than most EPs, yet too short to be considered an album-album. Somehow, it works. Why add filler just to call it an album? It's another example of Knowles and Hynes forgoing conventional wisdom and doing things their own way. Seven songs can be the perfect length; a collection of accessible and authentic pop can come out on an indie label; you can reshape the typical producer/songwriter/pop star model; you can create unassuming music that still sounds like a big deal. And ultimately, for Solange, you can retrace your steps and find yourself somewhere entirely new."

The NYC band's lead singer, Jorge Elbrecht, was a founding member of the now-dormant ""art collective"" Lansing-Dreiden, who last signed off full-length-wise with 2006's murky, equally new wave and OMD-worshipping The Dividing Island. Violens' 2010 debut, Amoral, ditched the shadows and fog for pop-rock bounce and Boo Radleys impressions that were impressively faithful, if not totally memorable. For the band's follow-up, True, they've moved to perpetually in-vogue indie pop revivalist mecca Slumberland. In general, Elbrecht and his latest project haven't strayed too far from the same sonic mission announced circa L-D's excellent The Dividing Island cut ""Two Extremes"": All sonic roads still end shortly before Bill Clinton first took residence in the White House, the previous Echo and the Bunnymen comparisons joined here by takes on the jangly roar of first-wave shoegazers like Pale Saints, Slowdive, and Ride.Those slight changes in genre-based sound are the results of True being Violens' first true full-band effort, as the record's writing sessions began while the band's current lineup was touring behind Amoral. This turns out to be a boon, since True sounds more melodically pretty and dewy-eyed than its predecessor. If you're the ceiling-staring type that gets chills from just a few seconds of chiming guitar, or maybe a snatch of achingly sung vocals, this record might be just your thing. Undoubtedly, these simple pleasures seem all the more pleasurable because the bar's been lowered over the past few years when it comes to ""this kind of stuff,"" which gives True a whiff of ephemerality; on the other hand, ""enjoy it while you can"" doesn't seem like particularly terrible advice as long as you can, well, enjoy it.When I say ""this kind of stuff,"" I'm referring to the current and ongoing guitar-indie embrace of shoegaze-derived texture and feel, which wasn't very present in the sparkling clarity that Amoral wore like the prettiest nail polish. On True, that's been replaced by the kind of production touches you'd expect from a Slumberland release-- reverb, distanced vocals, guitars coated in a warm glow. Over the past few years, those things have become synonymous with representing guitar-focused indie music that's tagged as ""lo-fi,"" but there's not much about True that sounds home-recorded or shabby. As he did on Amoral, Elbrecht handled the production duties on True, and his able ear makes True less a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP and more of a studio professional's idea of what a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP would sound like. It's the small details, like the howling wind and bird cries that open ""Sariza Spring"" or the exquisitely applied layers of echo on closer ""So Hard to See"", that mark this album as a headphones listen.Here's why I hold some reservation against Violens: True shows that Elbrecht and his band are more than capable of recreating moments from the past in a way that is reverent and still provides pleasure to those who grew up listening to those past sounds and relative newbies alike. But I'm not so sure that they're good at doing much more than that. Violens seem to have hit their sweet spot here, though, so hopefully they'll continue drilling in the same place instead of looking for more history that's ripe for plundering."

Maybe you'll move across the ocean, change your hair, pick up a new hobby. For Amélie Rousseaux, the French-American musician who performs as Sofia Bolt, post-breakup reinvention entailed swapping Paris for L.A., getting into surfing—and oh, writing a slightly clumsy, mostly lovely debut album called Waves.The first thing you notice about Waves is the atmosphere. On opener “London 2009,” Rousseaux recalls the initial spark of attraction over snippets of party chatter, clinked glasses, and pouty-lipped surf-rock guitars. “I was so drawn to you/Artistic, timid, cute,” she sings. Her lyrics are often messy, with endearingly clunky rhyme schemes and the occasional cliché, but she’s aided by talented session musicians and oceans of reverb.Sometimes, Rousseaux plays it a little too cool for her own good. On “Ojai,” she casts her disaffected eye across a room full of “wannabe hippies,” sounding not so much above it all as detached. After pontificating about hot springs and horizons, she switches to French and allows a beach-rock guitar solo to see her out. The arrangements are distinctive, but Rousseaux’s own voice gets a little lost.The title track, which comes in two versions, offers the biggest surprise. The first version sounds like every other song on the record: moody, chic, simmering. The second, appearing at the very end, is arranged by the legendary Van Dyke Parks. The master L.A. weirdo’s trademark orchestral flourishes move through the flimsy song like a summer storm spinning a weather vane; it’s a trip to hear Parks’ work punctuating lines as facile as “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” and “hella easy.” But ultimately, Waves is a debut. It’s an asymmetrical listen, and that’s fine; there’s more than enough promise here. Amélie Rousseaux moved halfway across the world to heal, and it is a pleasure to hear her processing."

Before every other mainstream rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101 was the album T.I. should've made. Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done.All that changes on King. From the opening seconds, something is different: low ominous strings, a regal horn fanfare swooping over funk guitars, and eerie horror-movie pianos welling up from some unseen abyss. The track's producer, Just Blaze, never makes tracks for Southern rappers, but here he's given T.I. a monstrous banger, something very few rappers will enjoy in their careers, and the emcee takes it like it's his birthright, stretching his drawl over the hectic boom like he just didn't have anything better to do. Over the first four tracks, nothing lets up. Texas legends UGK revisit one of their classic trunk-rattlers on ""Front Back"", and T.I. sounds like he's doing them a favor.Single ""What You Know"" is truly epic, DJ Toomp's swollen synth woozily curling up and T.I. eating the track for lunch, beating Jeezy at the ad-lib game before delivering one of those choruses that gets stuck in your head all day and you don't even mind. And ""I'm Talkin' to You"" brings back Just Blaze again, laying down horn-blats with Bomb Squad urgency and T.I. coming heated and dangerous as fuck, utterly destroying some unnamed opponent (""How many different ways is it to say I'm getting cheddar more/ Than niggas twice as old, more popular and even selling more?"") before busting out a head-spinning double-time flow on the last verse. When the dust finally settles, it's for ""Live in the Sky"", a maudlin but pretty ballad, T.I. bitterly lamenting dead friends before going on to regret his own mistakes, the storied seven felonies that mean his life could basically end after one slip-up, Jamie Foxx gingerly cooing the chorus."

His new album testifies to those talents without calling too much attention to itself.,"Michael Milosh was born with the gift of a golden voice. His swooning, androgynous countertenor—which has been compared to Sade’s so many times she should probably receive a portion of Milosh’s royalties by now—seems to radiate desire and longing with every vibration. At times, he sounds a little like Marvin Gaye at his most weightless, with the anguish shaved off.That voice has been the beating heart of nearly every song released by Rhye, the musical project Milosh founded a decade ago with producer Robin Hannibal and of which he is the only continuous member. So it’s striking that Home, the group’s latest, is the first Rhye album to make significant use of voices other than Milosh’s. Forty-nine voices, in fact: Home begins and ends with ghostly, wordless cantos sung by the 49-piece Danish National Girls’ Choir, which took advantage of Danish grant money to travel to Los Angeles to record with Rhye. Midway through “Holy,” the album’s muted climax, those cherubic voices “Oooh” and “Aaaah” their way into the groove, like sunlight streaming into a dim room.Perhaps the moment resonates because it evokes a particular kind of musical togetherness that’s been lost to the pandemic: large choral groups singing together in the same space. (Since the early spread of COVID-19, choir performances have been linked to outbreaks in the United States, Germany, England, and other countries; these recordings, thankfully, are from 2019.) It’s a form of communion that’s clearly meaningful to Milosh, who sang in a choir as a child. Or maybe it’s just a supremely well-engineered slice of downtempo bliss, as Rhye is wont to deliver. But the choir also stands out as one of the few aspects of Home that breaks substantially from the group’s by-now-familiar soft-pop formula.Otherwise, all the usual elements of a Rhye album are here and accounted for. Milosh still slips in and out of falsetto with enviable grace. He still addresses most of his lyrics in the second-person—“The more I love your face/The more I get to taste,” “Can you feel my fire deep inside/Can you feel my fire growing high,” etc.—cooing sweet innuendos to the object of his desire. The album cover once again depicts a woman, naked and tastefully cropped. And the title is another one-word noun—Home—meant to signify the house in the Santa Monica Mountains that has been both a home and creative base for Milosh and his partner/collaborator, Geneviève Medow-Jenkins, since 2019. (That’s where the album first took shape, and where the couple has been broadcasting experiential events incorporating ambient music, massage, and meditation in recent months.)"

Today, we revisit a pure and quiet record from 2002, when the Dixie Chicks were the most righteous band in country music.","As the summer of 2001 drew to a close, Natalie Maines invited her bandmates—the sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer—to play some bluegrass in her living room in Austin, Texas. They’d been off the road for a few years, and their plan was to hang out, catch up, and remember how good it feels to hear their voices blend in harmony, for no audience but each other. Earlier that year, they’d sued their label for withholding royalties from their first two blockbuster albums. In the years after, they’d find themselves in a righteous battle against the industry, leaving their future as a band uncertain. But for now, they were enjoying the most relaxed, unburdened creative experience of their lives.It was Maguire on fiddle, Strayer on banjo and dobro, and Maines with a voice like a gut-punch. No amplifiers. No drums. One song Maines suggested they try was Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide,” a classic rock staple that Stevie Nicks wrote at the age of 27. Maines, who had just turned 27 herself, found new resonance in its words after the birth of her first child and she thought she could hear her bandmates’ voices in its bittersweet sunshower of a melody. Also on the setlist were two songs written by the folk artist Patty Griffin. One was about speaking your mind in the face of public dissent; the other was about winding up on your deathbed with a long list of regrets.They weren’t planning on making an album. And even if they were, because of the lawsuit, they figured they couldn’t release it anyway. As the music started coming together and Maines enlisted her father, behind-the-scenes steel guitar legend Lloyd Maines, to produce the sessions, they brainstormed a couple of strategies. After the surprise success of the bluegrass soundtrack to the Coen Brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou?, they thought maybe these songs would be served best in a film. They contemplated going indie. They considered breaking the mold and sharing the music directly on their website for free, a way to thank the loyal audience they’d amassed as a major breakthrough act in the late ’90s.At the time, their lawsuit with Sony was the biggest controversy the Dixie Chicks had ever faced. But it was far from their first battle. By now, they were used to fighting for everything they wanted. There were problems with their Little Feat-inspired band name: the label didn’t like “Chicks,” other corners were uncomfortable with “Dixie.” At least one sound guy refused to plug in their instruments at a show, assuming them to be mere props. In the studio, there was the man who thought the iconic title track of their 1998 major label debut Wide Open Spaces wasn’t country enough for them to track; and then there were the industry people who thought it was too country and asked for a remix without banjo and fiddle. Their answer, of course, was hell no. They learned quickly their instincts were right."

He contributes to a few charming songs here but is only part of Home's appeal.","As the de facto leader of the collective Phantom Posse, New York-based multi-instrumentalist Eric Littmann (whose solo project Phantom Power gives the group its name) has overseen several low-key collections of hazy electro-pop. But in the year and change since the group's last set, one of the musicians in the orbit of the amorphous crew has seen his profile raised substantially. On the strength of a Drake remix and a well-received EP of similarly blunted ballads, iLoveMakonnen was one of rap radio's strangest successes in 2014. But while he was working with the likes of Mike WiLL Made It and Sonny Digital, he also found time to lend vocals to four of the tracks on Home, Phantom Posse's latest full-length.While the Makonnen connection is the most likely entry point to the record, his contributions are only a small part of what's going here. Each contributor brings something uniquely warped to the LP's seasick atmosphere, starting with the first timid vocal on the album, courtesy of Renee Anderson of Melbourne, Australia's Private Life. Amidst swooning keyboard passes and the gleeful dips and dives of a nylon-stringed guitar, Anderson's breathy vocals suggest sighs, winks, and smirks. Throughout the record, there's a sense of humor and playfulness implicit in each syrupy saxophone part (on album opener ""Separate Ways"") or deadpanned vocalizations (often courtesy Makonnen or Littmann himself).Ariel Pink has employed the same sort of tongue-in-cheek approach to arrangements, but Littmann and company depart from the legions of Pink acolytes by rejecting post-millennial irony. Instead, Phantom Posse offer sincerity. There are chintzy horn lines, sure, but there's also endearingly bare reflections on dissolving relationships (""She Gets Lonely""), urban disaffection (""Come to Chicago""), and other simple woes. When Makonnen dedicates ""I'm Stranded"" to his dad, then lazily drawls that he doesn't feel like calling him anyway, it highlights the charming disconnect that lies at the heart of this record. At one moment distant and goofy and the next heartwarmingly bare, Phantom Posse spans the gamut of indie pop songwriting.The emotional range of Phantom Posse is evident in the solo work of the constituent members (Littmann pens self-serious love songs under the jokey moniker Steve Sobs and Makonnen has been known to pair even his most heartfelt ballads with Andy Milonakis videos), so they have practice balancing these impulses, and Home succeeds in crafting a delightfully dizzying headspace out of that divide. It can be tricky to handle serious subjects with a smile and Littmann's crew keeps getting better. It's only a surreal bonus that an internationally famous rapper had a hand in its construction."

Their debut album's dozen tracks are stuffed to the brim with disparate parts and unfold in unexpected ways.","We're in the middle of a golden year for British pop music, one that has found young artists digesting the future-forward sounds of their formative years and distilling them into ruthless, radio-ready pop forms. Some of these debut efforts, like Disclosure's masterful Settle and AlunaGeorge's R&B-leaning Body Music, have already hit North American shores; others, like singles from smoky, soulful crooner John Newman and garage producer Naughty Boy, have yet to make a transatlantic connection. The latest salvo from across the pond comes courtesy of London quartet Rudimental, whose debut record Home earned a #1 British debut in April on the heels of two chart-topping hits, ""Feel the Love"" and ""Waiting All Night"".Rudimental's members-- Piers Aggett, Kesi Dryden, Amir Amor, and DJ Locksmith-- pride themselves on lending an earned musicality and eclecticism to dance music. The group's name draws from Dryden's childhood piano lessons: he was routinely disciplined for forgetting his rudiments, a book containing elementary principles of rhythm and musical theory. Their experiential approach to songwriting is evident throughout Home's dozen tracks, many of which are stuffed to the brim with disparate parts and unfold in unexpected ways.More than a few songs on Home feature frenetic drum 'n bass loops, and the success of those songs varies. ""Feel the Love"" launches warped synth lines and horn riffs alongside a gritty guest performance from Newman before abruptly switching gears in its final third; ""Waiting All Night"" rides a star-making spot from young vocalist Ella Eyre to similar heights. But the tracks that follow a similar template feature soaring but ultimately bland vocals overwhelmed by their rhythmic counterparts.Home's finest moments occur when Rudimental stray from the sound that led them to chart success. The album's two best songs were co-written and sung by British up-and-comer MNEK, who possesses a rich, nuanced voice at the age of 18. ""Spoons"" glides on a gently pulsing synth and a clicking percussive line tapped out on the titular instrument; the skittering, mid-tempo ""Baby"" features interplay between MNEK and a sparkling, sassy Sinead Harnett. The relatively straightforward house of these songs stand with the best of this year's strong batch of British pop singles.Home's American release is poorly timed. In recent months, their contemporaries have released well-crafted, self-assured debuts. Rudimental are casting a wider musical net than their peers, which has the unintended effect of magnifying their flaws by comparison, making for a decent but ultimately second-tier effort in a crowded year for big-ticket dance-pop."

Yet even Mapfumo, an outspoken critic of Mugabe's destructive and dangerous dictatorship, can no longer call Zimbabwe home, having relocated from Zimbabwe in 2000 to the not-very-exotic environs of Eugene, Oregon, where he's lived as in exile ever since, safe but homesick. Much of his family remains in Africa, and so, clearly, does his heart.That certainly explains how Mapfumo has been able to sustain his anger over three productive decades of music making, which have not just extended but deepened his reign as folk hero. What's been even more remarkable has been the prolonged power of his songwriting itself. Even in Oregon, away from the horrors and vast disappointments of Zimbabwe, Mapfumo's no lion in repose. He's kept up a prolific pace, releasing nearly a disc of his Chimurenga (or ""music of struggle"") a year while constantly touring with his band Blacks Unlimited.Originally released as a download-only album but picked up last year by Peter Gabriel's Real World, Rise Up features a slightly more pared-down Blacks Unlimited, who now include a few Americans in their midst. Yet most of the hallmarks of classic Mapfumo remain intact: the circular guitar patterns, the pulses of organ, the pluck of multiple mbira, the call of horns, the cry of female backing singers. Mapfumo's often drawn comparisons to Bob Marley, and the melodies and performances here do share a certain soulfulness, spirituality, and conviction. If Mapfumo chose to sing in English rather than his native Shona, who knows? Maybe frat guys across the country would be listening to him as well.They're not, of course. Nor are they likely troubled by the same issues that trouble Mapfumo, even if they're delivered with a hint of a reggae (particularly in the drum fills) and hypnotic polyrhythms. As Mapfumo's anthems helped fuel Mugabe's 1980 rise to power-- Mapfumo's ""songs of struggle"" were originally enlisted against then-Rhodesia's white-minority rule-- the singer no doubt feels the need to pay penance in the form of his critical songs, his moral authority heightened not hampered by the ironic role he played in the corruption of his own ideals."

They dress like spangley futuristic mime robots, which I suppose is sort of annoying, but that really doesn't have anything to do with their music. They bankrupted their record label and waited way too long to put their first album out, but again, all that stuff is strictly extra-musical. They actively and knowingly marketed themselves as electroclash, but Fischerspooner has much more in common musically with the Scissor Sisters than Miss Kittin or A.R.E. Weapons. They've never managed to make anything as great as their first single, but then ""Emerge"" was such a dizzy, searing monster jam that it'd be hopeless to hold any group to that standard forever.So the only real reason I can think of to hate Fisherspooner is the vwerdle-vwerdle-vwerdle oscillating synth-bass sound they use on every single song. This can grow tired after an entire album, but it's a good, malleable sound, as effective on breathy, luxuriant opium-disco tunes like ""A Cloud"" as on swooping, lazy filter-Fleetwood-Mac tracks like ""Happy"". And plus you can ratchet up the pitch a bunch on the chorus and the song will automatically sounds way more intense.On Odyssey, the group piles on huge, clattering drums, mournful house pianos, deliriously sleazy strutting white-funk guitars. The album's production is clean enough to sterilize needles; everything has a lavish, glossy cocaine sheen. The group has recruited help from pop-music pros like Mirwais (who produced Madonna's ""Music"", which is fucking awesome) and Linda Perry (who wrote Pink's ""Get This Party Started"", which is fucking awesome). They got the now deceased Susan Sontag to write the lyrics for ""We Need a War"", which is nice, but it's not like anyone ever listens to the lyrics on Fischerspooner songs.Odyssey is Fischerspooner's attempt at kicking and screaming their way out of punchline hell, so it's a bit of a surprise how good everything sounds. The deluxe, swirley disco tracks that begin the album slide nicely into the brittle new-wave funk and imperiously sighed synthed ballads. All of this builds beautifully to the group's cover of the Boredoms' smeary psychedelic symphony ""Circle"". It's something of a shock hearing the Boredoms' messy drum-circle monolith translated through Fischerspooner's glammy synths, but the group approaches the song with the majestic fervor it demands, and the result is a truly gorgeous pileup.Odyssey isn't a great album: Many of the vocal hooks are weak and underfed, the group never finds the widescreen abandon of ""Emerge"", and there's that synth burble on every song. But the group has managed to come up with an appealingly grand, ridiculous epic, more than anyone could reasonably expect from these forgotten freaks. So find some other band to hate. May I suggest Kings of Leon?"

Their woefully overlooked 2008 debut full-length, Parc Avenue, was ripe to be expanded upon. Full of spacious, mostly acoustic almost-folk sounds, it spackled rich, otherworldly harmonies and honeyed, finger-picked guitar lines over rambling epics. On Parc Avenue, P&A drew a direct line between the bearded Laurel Canyon folk-rockers of the 1970s and the modern psychedelia of bands like Animal Collective. But La La Land, unfortunately, is more concerned with plugging in and cranking up the volume than it is with the subtleties that colored its predecessor.As its title suggest, La La Land sounds very much like the glitzy, tough L.A. It's not just song titles like ""Tom Cruz"", ""American Idol"", and ""Kon Tiki"" (named for a tacky L.A. hotel) that recall the entertainment capital, but also the album's fuzzed-out Sunset Strip guitar tones, kinetic, urban rhythms, and glossy production makeover. Yet while there is laudable roughness and robustness to these harder charging tracks, no amount of energy or amplification can obscure a song's bloat or lack of memorable hooks. Plants and Animals' strong suit was never the sing-along chorus or the earworm melody, but this new album's aggressiveness-- which plays in stark contrast to the casual, country-stoner pace of its precursor-- combined with the punch of its guitar sound, makes you long for tight pop hooks that never come.However, amid the album's overstuffed and more conventionally paced tracks, some beautifully strange gems can be unearthed. Unsurprisingly, the album's best moments most closely resemble the meandering songs of Parc Avenue. Songs like ""Game Show"" and ""Undone Melody"", which hinge on gritty acoustic foundations and climax with uplifting harmonies, represent the band's most logical progressions from Parc Avenue. The best use of their new plugged-in sound is ""American Idol"", which, with the rhythmic patter of its vocals and the percussive groove of its riffs, sounds more like Talking Heads than Plants and Animals. So while La La Land may not be the stellar follow-up that Parc Avenue deserved, it does offer something for fans willing to look beyond its tarted-up exterior."

His new album Holographic features singers Olga Bell and Caroline Shaw.","With 2013’s Corps Exquis, composer Daniel Wohl offered a set of concise, punchy pieces joining glitchy electronic verve with traditional chamber music lyricism. At some points, the digital manipulations were identifiable as processed versions of parts being played by the musicians, and at others, they operated independently of each other. In the best moments, you couldn’t tell what was live and what was pre-programmed.On his follow-up, Wohl includes a pair of two-movement works that show how suited he is to larger canvases. A slowly moving, two-note drone launches ""Replicate, Pt. 1,"" and operates in the background throughout, while the live musicians work with pitched percussion figures that build on themselves slowly. Brisk electronic beats introduce the piece’s second half—though the composition never scales the frenetic peaks of Corps Exquis.This comparative restraint pays off when a gorgeous vibraphone ostinato emerges in the closing minutes of ""Replicate, Pt. 2."" Wohl playfully manipulates the groove, letting the tempo quicken and slack unpredictably. ""Holographic,"" another piece that stretches across two tracks, also builds its momentum in a natural, relaxed fashion, underlining the subtler chops of the musicians who make up the often-clangorous Bang on Can All-Stars group.The album’s initially deliberate, patient air ensures that its hyperactive set piece registers strongly. With an evident love for unusual, junkyard sonorities and febrile rhythm, ""Progression"" brings the maverick sound of mid-century American composer Harry Partch into the electro-classical present day. And its tightly interwoven writing for strings and percussion also suggests that Wohl could compose just fine in purely acoustic settings if he wanted.In between these pieces are a few items that sound slight next to the more ambitious material. It’s not difficult to imagine how the singers who show up for ""Source""—Olga Bell and Pulitzer-prize winner (and Kanye West collaborator) Caroline Shaw—might inspire Wohl, though the meeting winds up sounding merely pleasant. Elsewhere, the Mivos Quartet—the same group who pairs up so winningly with Mantra Percussion on ""Progression""—have much less to do during ""Formless."" Still, the electro-acoustic balance on these tracks is expertly handled. It just happens to be the case that this notoriously hard-to-perfect blend might not be Wohl’s greatest talent, after all."

Last we heard from the multitasking Into It. Over It. songwriter, he was pouring out his heart on Standards, one of the more sophisticated albums to emerge from the emo revival, but Weiss has a band for every occasion. In his side project with Mike Kinsella, Their/They’re/There, he indulges his inner math-rock geek, paying homage to some of the more niche corners of Polyvinyl’s discography—much as his old project Stay Ahead of the Weather reveled in the sugary emo of groups like the Get Up Kids. His defining records have been passion projects crafted for people who love these genres as much as he does, but when he’s just looking to goof around, he turns to Pet Symmetry, his trio with a couple of Chicago pop-punk vets, Dowsing’s Erik Czaja and What Gives’ Marcus Nuccio.Until now the group has mostly defined themselves by their love of puns. Their 2015 full-length Pets Hounds tossed them off at a clip seldom witnessed since Elvis Costello’s Get Happy!! phase, and in concert the band dials up the silliness even further, taking the stage in matching varsity jackets or Hawaiian shirts. In a certain light, there’s something radical about that irreverence, especially given the more serious tendencies of emo’s fourth wave. Acts like the Hotelier and the Wonder Years have raised the stakes with each record, documenting grief and depression in discomforting detail. Sorority Noise and Modern Baseball’s recent releases have doubled, sometimes literally, as suicide prevention hotline advertisements, giving emo a renewed sense of purpose. Meanwhile, Pet Symmetry have taken the opposite track, pulling back the curtain on one of emo’s great secrets: Behind all the sobering prose and artful conviction, there’s usually a bunch of guys who love sports and find it hilarious every time their drummer farts up their tour van.On their sophomore album Vision, Pet Symmetry look to emo’s more carefree corners, particularly the pop-centric emo of bands like the Promise Ring and the Smoking Popes. Vision delivers on that promise of a good time. “St. John” sets its frothy mall-punk riff to a pogoing bassline, while Weiss breaks out a surprisingly convincing Frank Black impression on the manic, alterna-punk throwback “Eyesores,” one of several tracks that slide in under the two-minute mark. It’s all so brisk and agreeable that it takes a few spins to notice the band’s recalibration: They’ve dialed back the indiscriminate humor of Pets Hounds, bringing their songwriting closer in line with Weiss’ heartfelt Into It.

Death often forces fans and critics to prematurely unpack a rapper’s legacy, whether they were cut down in their prime or before they began to truly blossom. Some don’t live to see 30. Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., two of the most important rappers of all time, were murdered in their mid-20s, barely six months apart. Over the last three years, the rap community has lost a string of young talent to gun violence (Pop Smoke), drug overdose (Juice WRLD), and other unfortunate circumstances. This makes it all the more special when a rapper does cross over into middle age, a privilege only some of the genre’s legends have been able to enjoy.DMX had just turned 50 before he passed away on April 9, 2021. Since the early 1990s, X had funneled a life of unspeakable adversity into music as pious as it was grisly, a guttural voice confronting his own personal hell in order to see heaven. His constant struggles with drug addiction and mental health were a frequent topic in his music, coloring a tumultuous 30-year career that included five consecutive No. 1 albums, several hit singles, and film roles. DMX wasn’t the first rapper to turn their demons into jet fuel, but he lived to build an inspiring legacy that persisted even as his personal problems became public fodder for jokes and memes.Exodus, his posthumous eighth studio album and first proper album since 2012’s Undisputed, was sparked by the overwhelming fan support shown during his Verzuz battle against Snoop Dogg in July 2020. According to longtime collaborator Swizz Beatz—who also executive produced the project—X wrestled with thoughts of retirement during the recording process, so they attempted to make Exodus as emotionally and musically varied as possible. “There are many different sides of X,” Swizz recently told Complex. “We wanted to channel all those sides on this album.” It may have sounded like a fitting tribute on paper, but Exodus is largely sloppy and inconsequential, a sour note to bookend a storied legacy.In all fairness, Exodus wasn’t initially intended to be the swan song for DMX’s career. On the contrary; it was supposed to be a comeback album of sorts. Swizz insists that the album was finished within X’s lifetime and that the only change made to the record was subbing out a previously used Pop Smoke verse for one by Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo on the aptly titled “Money Money Money.” If this truly was X’s vision, his attempt to come back with a big bang with his partner-in-crime by his side, it sputters more often than it pops."

But for DJ and music video director Alex Moulton, the two aren't mutually exclusive. As the founder of media production house Expansion Team, Moulton lords over scores of tightly wound marketing storylines for corporate clients like Target and McDonald's. His debut full-length Exodus gives him the freedom to confront those filmic aspects while wearing his DJ hat. With Exodus, Moulton constructs an instrumental science-fiction adventure that, unencumbered by lingual constraints, functions as a narrative mirror, its proggy signifiers pursuing only an obsessive sense of escapism.The single visual that accompanies Exodus, its cover, depicts such a sci-fi scene: A shirtless stud holds a damsel in distress, both suspended in time, frozen in flight from a fiery cityscape. The CD's label is a mockup of printed vinyl grooves. And from the first stabs of Moog arpeggios cutting across ""Overture"", the proverbial laser-stringed harp of Jean-Michel Jarre looms large. Moulton said of Exodus: ""I wanted to make something like a Pink Floyd record, where you put it on and you listen to the whole thing all the way through and it takes you on this crazy journey."" The nostalgia that he invokes is clearly the kind that imagined an analogue future.However, Moulton's idea of psychedelia is more Tangerine Dream's Klaus Schulze than Floyd's Roger Waters, embracing the Berlin school knob-twiddler conflict between man and machine rather than any Cambridge or Canterbury absurdity. In the course of Exodus, he bounces between his retro muse and one of its fast-forwarded descendents, filter disco, and the shadows of Daft Punk and Alan Braxe appear out of his gauzy synthesized lines in ""Out of Phase"", ""Meridians"", and ""Paradise"". Just as often, however, his dance beats give way to live drums and even tribal rhythms. Interludes play a central role in Moulton's story, linking nightclubby action scenes, otherworldly jungle chases (""The Sacrifice"") and somber love themes (""Together Again""). Indeed, the mood changes so drastically and so often-- nearly every song-- that it's sometimes hard to feel in tune with his greater conceit.That's one of the reasons why Exodus leaves so many unanswered questions. ""Exodus"" sounds like the climactic battle, and the final two cuts, ""Ad Astra"" (""to the stars"" in Latin) and ""L'Arc en Ciel"" (""the rainbow"" in French) hint at some sort of romantic transcendence, but Moulton leaves the details up to the listener. As its conceptual cousin Interstella 5555 visually depicted, the success of an otherworldly storyline can't mask the awkward realities of his medium. Exodus's 14 tracks and 68 minutes rise and fall like 14 little films, with the larger narrative rising almost exclusively from the songs' shared analog antiquity. Moulton's concept falters when the listener tries to piece these sensory experiences into a linear progression, but Exodus is still a fascinating and problematic listen as a whole. It's the individual works, however, that emerge as the stars of their own little show. In that sense, Moulton has not only met his goal of the simultaneous concept album and DJ mix-- he's exceeded it by light years."

Their oft-delayed debut album features Tricky, Sia, Planningtorock, the xx's Romy Madley Croft, Alejandra Deheza of School of Seven Bells, and others.","CREEP seemed to fade away before they really got started. The Brooklyn-based duo of Lauren Dillard and Lauren Flax showed promise with their 2010 single ""Days"", only to find their momentum diluted by a minor controversy and an affiliation with a fly-by-night genre. That song was a joint effort with Romy Madley Croft from the xx, who was the first in a string of collaborators to come on board with Dillard and Flax to help flesh out the band's sound. CREEP have surfaced intermittently over the last three years, often as remixers, but also with occasional advances on their own take on trip-hop. Some of the artists they helped remix come on board as collaborators here (Planningtorock, Alejandra Deheza of School of Seven Bells), on an oft-delayed album that plunges into the darkness and never looks back, pulling in a mix of old and new tracks on the way down.If nothing else, Echoes is a timely release, coming at a point when artists such as Arca, FKA twigs, and DropxLife are developing a potent strain of 21st century trip-hop. Where those artists take the genre as a starting point, CREEP remain fully immersed in the sound, siphoning off some of its dingiest moments as a primal source. As such, Echoes is more Mezzanine than Blue Lines, recalling the point where Massive Attack sucked any remnants of optimism out of their sound. For a collection of tracks culled from such a long period of time, and with a different guest vocalist on each, it's a surprisingly coherent and linear album. ""Days"" doesn't sound out of place from (presumably) more recent recordings, such as the mournful ""Vertigo"", which features the welcome return of Lamb singer Lou Rhodes.In among the shade there's a sense of drama forcing through the fog, with most tracks shaped by sparse arrangements and echo-y vocals. It has the unfortunate effect of making CREEP sound like they're trying too hard to make a bold statement with every turn they take, perpetually searching for a spine-chilling moment that's just beyond their reach. Mostly the execution is lacking—the beats on ""Empty Church"" are ghostly thin, the synths on ""Jessica King"" are set to the ""plume of smoke"" preset for the nth time, the Sia-featuring ""Dim the Lights"" rubs stodgy strings up against a too-predictable music box sound. The guest vocalists occasionally shine despite their surroundings. Tricky's turn on ""Call Her"" is particularly notable, reaching whispery Maxinquaye peaks while Deheza works up perfectly floaty harmonies behind him.What binds the original trip-hop artists, who were reluctant (to say the least) to be grouped together under the banner, was a sense of people digging deep into introspection, often reaching a point that was uncomfortably personal. There was a grit to what they were doing, a sense of beats that had been labored over for months, of samples that had been endlessly tweaked through the night. Echoes, despite its long gestational period, resembles the work of a couple of ""Twin Peaks"" freaks playing trip-hop dress up, even going so far as to channel David Lynch collaborator Julee Cruise on ""The Key"". Their best moment is still the skittering ""Days"", but sticking a song from 2010 on an album from 2013 feels like the actions of a band who are coming up short of ideas on how to move forward."

What you're increasingly witnessing at every club, at every show, with every passing night, is the death of the horrible, awkward, uncomfortable tension of devoted music fans pretending not to enjoy music they have paid to see. Finally, we are shaking off the coma of the stillborn slacker 90s and now there is movement. Arms uncross, faces snap to attention, and clarity hits like religion. We have buried irony and pissed on its grave and for the first time we are realizing what rock music, rock shows are all about.Fuck, was that a dream? Pavement playing the Showbox in Seattle to throngs of unwashed hippie revivalists acting as if they'd been imprisoned there by a cruel master of ceremonies, their peer and equal Stephen Malkmus? Eddie Vedder iconically scrawling PRO-CHOICE up his left arm like he bore the weight of the entire fucking world and was the only living person with this Great Important Answer to all the world's problems? That the Dismemberment Plan-- among the first to envision this future at which we've now arrived-- called us out to our faces with ""Doing the Standing Still"" and we actually still just stood there? It's almost impossible to believe in light of music like this, music that finally places as much emphasis on real, true, palpable fun as it does on art.As brilliant as this music sounds on paper and CD, nothing compares to experiencing it live. I saw it taking shape (""but I was there!"") at the beginning of this summer in Chicago: The Rapture unleashing their primal digifunk on Chicago's stuffy Metro. As the band took the stage, two kids behind me absolutely lost their shit. Whatever it was they were doing, they were doing it alone-- at first. I've never seen anything like that: You could see it visibly sweeping the whole room. And these kids didn't have a clue ""how to dance,"" which was part of the brilliance of it: For one, it complemented the overcompensating freaks onstage not knowing how to play, but beyond that, it was the very spirit of punk. The revelation that you didn't need formal training to start a band in 1977 and the realization that you don't need to be Merce Cunningham to dance are one and the same. Fucking nobody knows how to dance at these shows-- in fact, you'd look like a jackass if you did."

The 23-year-old rising star Lor Scoota died in 2016 and local phenom Young Moose became the target of a Baltimore Police Department raid that resulted in him being imprisoned for eight months.Despite all this, Baltimore’s rap scene is thriving today. The loudest (and most nasally) voice in the city belongs to Shordie Shordie, who rose to prominence as the designated hook-man of Peso Da Mafia before leaving the group to try his hand at a solo career. Shordie’s melody-first approach to songwriting made him stand out in his former group. Reading the lyrics to his 2018 breakout single, “Bitchuary,” you’d think the song sounded closer to a questionable argument you hear through thin walls than a tense, flirty back-and-forth, but that’s Shordie’s appeal: Any vulnerability he’s willing to show is always going to be cloaked with a hook you want to sing in the shower.Memory Lane, Shordie’s follow-up to 2020’s >Music, is set on convincing you that he and “Nice for What” producer Murda Beatz have unrivaled chemistry—and for the most part, their ideas are in lockstep. The lone-producer project is new territory for Shordie, but he seems comfortable with Murda Beatz taking control. Early standout “Same Niggas” is the bread-and-butter that makes up the bulk of his discography. The subtext of every “Fuck you” he snarls is “And it don’t have to be this way.” This is just the first of several songs he spends licking his wounds—he’s a scorned lover, and he doesn’t care who knows it. “Keep your cheating to yourself and your phone, I don’t wanna cry,” he sings a song later on “Stuck in Between.”Shordie continues to push himself as a writer, slowly becoming worthy of the “Captain Hook” nickname he adopted while with his former group. Even so, Memory Lane is a bit of a mixed bag; for every fleshed-out story of love and loss, there’s a song that’s all hook with a blasé verse added as an afterthought, like the Frank Ocean-flipping “Moral to the Story.” Shordie makes up for that miss with “LOVE,” where his cries for “L-O-V-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E” and make-up sex are a welcome, yet unexpected callback to “Loveeeeeee Song.”Murda’s skeletal production is effective at establishing simple feelings like sadness and lust. Superstars like Drake and Cardi B flood the space on Murda’s beats with their charisma. Shordie, on the other hand, needs beats that aid his storytelling. Too often on Memory Lane is he left to do the emotional heavy lifting with his singing. These synergistic problems are only magnified by the one rapper/one producer format; a producer with a tag as recognizable as Murda’s should be bringing Shordie closer to being a household name. Instead, Murda’s contributions feel closer to the guy who you have to force to turn in his part of a group project. The album’s closer, “Ride with Shordie,” with a beat made up of just string plucks and handclaps, whisks you away to a beachside bonfire, and leaves you wondering if there were other songs with more imaginative production culled from the final tracklist. Shordie’s no stranger to stretching his voice to add an extra layer of emotion to the track, but Murda’s beats sound like they’re waiting for a second act that never begins.In 2019, Shordie told The Fader that it could sound like he was just doing “the easy part” with Peso Da Mafia, since he was focused on hooks. Going solo has let him flourish creatively; his hooks have only become a deadlier tool in his arsenal. At their simplest, Shordie’s love stories are lucid daydreams of what a situationship could’ve been, but when he puts it all together on Memory Lane, they’re storyboarded short films detailing the ups and downs of young love.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Their latest is full of billowing vocal harmonies, seismic rumble, and turbo-charged trap beats.","In the past couple of years, chill has become ubiquitous, not just as a verb (“Netflix and chill”) but as adjective (the “chill bro”), prefix (chillstep, chilltrap), and even noun: Per SoundCloud hashtags, at least, “chill” has become a genre unto itself. Contra Moore’s Law and all the breakneck terrors of an accelerated age, chill has been elevated to something like a state of being: a lifestyle, a philosophy, a categorical imperative.A whole musical scene has evolved to satisfy the urge to decelerate. But as the aforementioned chillstep and chilltrap (faded variants of dubstep and trap, if you hadn’t guessed) suggest, ironically enough, the chill scene, at least in electronic music, is inextricable from its main-stage, peak-hour EDM counterparts. It derives its power from super-sized subtlety, exaggerated gestures, a kind of weaponized softness; in its side-chained whoosh and billion-watt sparkle, it practically screams: YOU ARE VERY RELAXED NOW! (It seems not coincidental that the rise of chill has appeared alongside not just marijuana’s widespread legalization but also its lab-grown, gene-spliced, THC-boosted explosion in potency.)Odesza may not be the biggest stars of this movement (that distinction probably falls to Australia’s Flume), but they’re close. If their YouTube stats are impressive—23 million views for 2014’s “Say My Name,” 14 million for “Sun Models”—their numbers on Spotify are just mind-boggling: More than 82 million plays for “Sun Models,” nearly as much for “Say My Name,” close to a third of a billion cumulative plays across their top 10 songs on the platform. Not bad for a couple of guys who started making music together just five years ago, shortly before graduating from Western Washington University.The first Odesza album, 2012’s Summer’s Gone, offered a fairly innocuous contribution to the emerging chill canon, taking cues from Bonobo, Tycho, and Four Tet and smoothing them into a tantalizing array of chimes, feathery textures, and powdery drum hits. Two years later, In Return bathed in an even more opulent abalone glow; it also honed their pop instincts, fleshing out their usual ribbon-like strips of sampled vocals with chirpy guest turns that channeled the decade’s default pop-EDM vocal style into whimsical, helium-fueled shapes. It was original and meticulously produced, but it got cloying real fast, like chugging from an oversized hummingbird feeder.Today, Odesza are a proper stadium act. In May, they did two sold-out nights at Colorado’s Red Rocks, complete with electric guitar, eight-person choreographed drum line, and visuals by in-house live creative director Luke Tanaka. The new album is accordingly ambitious; it wants to be a lot of things, trigger a lot of feelings. It’s full of billowing vocal harmonies and seismic rumble and turbo-charged trap beats; its default mode is a kind of eyes-closed beatitude, and every climax is but a stepping stone to a bigger climax. That it’s an album about desire is obvious; you can sense their anticipation at feeling that brass ring brushing beneath their fingertips."

At age 20 or so, she answered the Kentucky five-piece’s call for a female backing vocalist, but never heard back. In one way, you can imagine it: both subtly violent acts from their respective south, with the accents to prove it. But even at the turn of the 1990s, the idea of Polly Jean Harvey bringing up the rear is hard to fathom—her Westcountry leer would have unleashed the devil incarnate into Slint’s whispered intimations of evil. Instead, Harvey’s debut single, which came nine months after Spiderland, in December ’91, confronted the danger of fulfilling someone else’s ideal.Released on indie label Too Pure off the back of a mailed-in demo and John Peel’s enthusiasm, “Dress” is a young woman’s desperate and naive attempt at seduction. Where riot grrrls in the Pacific Northwest were pouring acid on the grotesque mating charade, Harvey, fresh out of her first relationship, intensified the danger by playing the willing ingenue. In the song, she struggles against femininity’s constricting bodice; Eve drowning in apples, “spilling over like a heavy loaded fruit tree.” For all her efforts, it’s the wrong outfit: “‘You purdy thang,’ my man says, ‘But I bought you beautiful dresses,’” she mimics, sneering like the creep in a western. Her “clean and sparkling” dress instantly becomes a filthy rag, her identity abject: “Better get it out of this room/A falling woman in dancing costume.” Harvey’s identity, though, was immediately forged: Funny, furious, and capable of writing hooks—the taunted “If you put it on, if you put it on”—that burned like lit fuses.Two months later, in February 1992, Harvey followed “Dress” with second single “Sheela-Na-Gig,” a vocal tour-de-force: wheedling as she implores a man to gaze upon her “ruby-red ruby lips,” puffed up on revulsion—or is it awe?—as he dismisses her with a comparison to the titular Celtic fertility carving that depicts deranged women spreading their engorged vulvas: Her shout of “You exhibitionist!” sounds at once like a Puritan splutter and a belly laugh__.__ She vamps through a line from South Pacific (“Gonna wash that man right outta my hair”) and has her paramor recoil at her “dirty pillows,” like the mother in Stephen King’s Carrie, reinforcing her portrayal of a young woman doomed to humiliation through mimicking the candied sexuality of films and magazines. Capable only of seeing her as virgin or whore, this guy’s dismissal is horrifying, but Harvey’s extremes make it funny, and she channels her beloved Pixies’ loud-quiet dynamic into thunderous slapstick."

Chiefly, the folks who used to trip the visions fantastic via brown ones and orange ones have mellowed out on a cannabis tip. Freak-outs have been replaced by blissful highs, and acid flameouts like Brian Wilson's and Syd Barrett's have been replaced by stoner warlocks like Yume Bitsu and Richard Youngs. Or, if the hemp weed isn't your thing, just try slacking a bit more and take it easy. Today's psychedelic experience is peace, love and very, very slow tempos. And it can be a beautiful thing, brother.Nagisa Ni Te is the main event for Japanese hippie-titan and Org Records head Shinji Shibayama. Shibayama's been at it since the 1980s, when he started playing hyped up dada-psych with Idiot O'Clock and the more toned-down Hallelujahs. Well before mystic folk became fodder for VW commercials, Shibayama was conjuring up the spirits of Tim Buckley and Tim Hardin to the delight of the Japanese psychedelic scene. Nagisa Ni Te carries on that tradition, opting for natural highs and frequent moments of naïveté via slightly out-of-tune vocals and perfectly amateur acoustic guitar dedications. Shibayama started the band as a solo venture, but has gradually included his girlfriend Takeda Masako and various percussionists, as well as working with members of Eastern psych powers Maher Shalal Hash Baz.Feel is the band's fourth album, and is generally a step in a clearer direction, even if its relative clarity never really threatens to push the music into mainstream realms. The instrumentation is quite full, featuring guitar, percussion, classic Leslie organ and group vocals to emphasize general communal harmony. All of the lyrics are ir Japanese, and all of the songs are very slow, so any disorienting sensations you experience here might be due to more than just the forest green haze (which radiates not just from the rather gorgeous cover).Opening epic ""The New World"" starts things with a brief brainfreeze, as feedback guitar and backwards cymbals introduce a very earnest ballad-dirge. Pixie-vocalist Masako carries the solemn tune, as Shibayama strums his guitar and provides distant backing vocals. The prevailing mood is quite close to low-key Sigur Rós, or any number of symphonic post-Floyd balladeers. Masako never even attempts to inject any extraneous passion into the song, and comes across as being completely content to drag alongside her partner in carefree melancholy. When the mellotron strings come in, things take a turr for the spacey, but the fact remains this is pretty peaceful stuff.""Strength of the Wind"" pulls out all the retro stops, pumping up the mandolin and Leslie switches to summon the ghosts of the Small Faces and The Band, while simultaneously staying true to Nagisa Ni Te's folkish roots. This time, Shibayama takes the lead, and his modest tenor is a bit more confident, though never more aggressive than a child of nature should be. It's still a dirge, and when the ocarina comes in, straight out of Sherwood Forest, medieval chanson becomes the mode of choice. The backing vocals are still quite thick, and though the clear stereo separation betrays the modern recording, this tune could have been performed exactly as it appears here any time ir the last 35 years.Since most of the tunes share the same basic feeling of molasses-lader harmony, small variations tend to stick out. ""Morning Glory"" plays up the haunting triangle resonance and the elastic slide-guitar accompaniment; ""Speed of Fish,"" featuring the Boredoms' Seiichi Yamamoto on 'seaweed guitar,' emphasizes the pattering percussion and ambient overtones floating around the band. Closer ""Stars"" features a full ensemble of dual drummers, guitars, piano, mandolin and Leslie organ, and is probably the closest to an uplifting anthem as you'll find on Feel. Shibayama sings of the ""ancient light of stars"" and ""gazing at the retreating sail"" of some distant ship over music that is emotional without ever becoming maudlin. Reference points might be solo George Harrison or, again, Sigur Rós or early Small Faces, but the story is the same: benign psych-folk can cure your ills, and if it doesn't, at least it's got a shot at curing your insomnia. That's not an insult, but you should know Nagisa Ni Te are quite comfortably numb."

Centerpiece track ""Stupid Things"" is even more sublime, beginning with some tranquil, exploratory guitar noodling from Ira Kaplan that summons a brushed-snare beat resembling a krautrock skiffle, and sets its chorus aflight on a pillowy bed of strings.

Fade threatens to become too preoccupied with understated details during its increasingly subdued second act, and yet that sense of restraint just makes the triumphant finale ""Before We Run"" soar all the more gloriously, elevating Hubley's humble melody with a euphoric brass-and-string fanfare.

The only thing faster than the 19-year-old rapper’s flow is the prolific pace at which he releases music—Xan has released almost 30 projects on mixtape-hosting service Spinrilla in the past three years, though only a handful of those have made it over to Spotify. He’s been making music for much longer than he’s been releasing it: Xan started rapping at age 5 and had his own studio by the time he was a preteen. A six-month stint behind bars on undisclosed charges briefly interrupted his output, but he’s been grinding harder than ever since his release in May. He’s released multiple projects this year, but Broken is the first that approaches retail-album length.Given his age, Xanman’s extensive discography is made even more impressive by being mostly self-produced. Like the state he hails from, Xan’s beats—which he refers to as “Xanstyles”—split the difference between North and South. There’s heavy Zaytoven influence to the glittering keys, MIDI strings, and organ swells on songs like “Broken, Pt. 1,” but an undeniable East Coast love that comes through in his affection for hip-hop instrumentals that he’s barely old enough to remember, like 50 Cent’s “Many Men,” Mary J. Blige’s “Family Affair,” and Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing).”Whether his words arrive over straight-up trap or something more soulful, Xanman has a fondness for hashtag rap, using punchlines to detail his plans to cause physical harm: “Flava Flav/You get clocked in the head,” “I put that bitch underground/Harriet Tubman.” At its best, Xan’s love of non-sequiturs gives his lyrics a light surrealism, but it encourages some cringier instincts: casual homophobia, jokes about Paul Walker’s death, and some especially regrettable bars about R. Kelly and Bill Cosby.Even then, he lets out his soulful side enough to keep the whole project mostly serious. For as many colorful metaphors Xanman comes up with to describe his guns, there’s an underlying sense of heartbreak, as the album title and cover indicate. His hooks are more often repeated expressions of emotional uncertainty—“Why you gotta be like that?”; “Have you ever been in love?”; “How would you feel?”—than declarative statements.In classic DMV fashion, Xanman doesn’t let the beat dictate the direction his flow takes, almost as if he’s in competition with it. He crams words into tight spaces and lets them spray in rapid bursts, sounding most at home over menacing, mosh-ready beats like “Brick Paper” and “Back Up.” Reigning rap queen Rico Nasty shows up for a co-signing spot on the remix to “Gucci Down,” the closest thing Xan has had to a hit thus far.Xan’s vocal delivery is the kind we’re used to hearing digitally manipulated, but he’s comfortable enough pushing himself into different registers, from a gruff low end to a twinkling falsetto, that he doesn’t need a computer to do it for him. Xanman has a mixtape series called “Luther Xandross,” which seems to suggest how he’d like to think of himself: as a soulful vocalist, not just a rapper. It’s hard to catch every single word he says, but the skill is clear enough."

He released only two solo full-lengths and an EP this decade, and those have been handily overshadowed by his hired-gun work with Martina Topley Bird, Melissa Auf der Maur, and the Baldwin Brothers, as well as his collaborations with Greg Dulli and Isobel Campbell. He could easily take the lead on any of these projects, but Lanegan seems to think we'll like him better in small doses. That, or he's planning a sort of Yojimbo double-cross that will pit the Twilight Singers against Belle and Sebastian.Who knows where Soulsavers would come out in such a melee? The British duo-- Rich Machin and Ian Glover-- are something of an unknown quantity, especially on American shores. They formed in 2003 as an electronica outfit specializing in remixes for bands iike Starsailor and Doves. Their distinguishing characteristic seems to be their fascination with American traditional forms, texturing their songs with buzzy threads of blues, gospel, folk, and jazz. Reportedly, touring behind their second album, It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land, shifted their priorities even further, away from programmed beats and toward live instrumentation to create a cinematic atmosphere on Broken, their third album and second with Lanegan.If How Far You Fall was formatted to fit your screen, then Broken is in CinemaScope. Spaghetti-western strings swell and shiver on ""Shadows Fall"", guitars grind vigorously on the Gene Clark cover ""Some Misunderstanding"", stray synthesizer blips shoot through ""Death Bells"" like sparks, and a lone piano provides an almost gothic solemnity on the Palace Brothers cover ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"". The record features a sizable cast that includes Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, Mike Patton of Faith No More, Richard Hawley, and Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers, and Australian newcomer Red Ghost, aka Rosa Agostino. Entering late in the album, she makes a good supporting actress, her smooth voice a nice compliment to Lanegan's rougher textures on ""Rolling Sky"". Perhaps she'll get more screen time on the sequel.Lanegan, however, remains our main protagonist, roaming Soulsavers' musical landscape mostly in isolation. His miles-of-bad-road voice is an obvious match for Soulsavers' gothic Americanisms, and he sounds like just another instrument in their arsenal, communicating meaning via sound more than lyrics. That's a good use of him, especially when his lyrics veer toward Biblical overstatement, as on ""All the Way Down"" when he sings about ""crystalline dawn"" and ""six white horses."" Also, there's this gem from ""Can't Catch the Train"": ""Sure as the shovel is blind, deaf, and digging/ One day you're alone at the end of your road.""And that's perhaps the problem with Broken: Too often its soundtrack atmosphere is too thick, its arrangements as obvious as a painted backdrop. The strings sound too much like Morricone, and ""Wise Blood"" recalls the quieter moments from Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman's score for The Last of the Mohicans more than the John Huston movie. On ""Unbalanced Pieces"" the whispered backing vocals dogging Lanegan have all the spooky effect of a horror trailer, and the menacing bassline is both seedy and Bad Seed-y, which only reinforces the unflattering comparison with the recent soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. In trying to literalize the often dismissive term ""soundtrack rock,"" Soulsavers emphasize the former to the neglect of the latter."

They match the mood and fervor you want from a Rashad track quite often, but it is hard to ignore their skeletal and fragmentary nature.","Posthumous art is always going to be a tad controversial. At its worst it feels like a tabloid-style ransacking of an archive. At its best it's a thoughtful and prodding collecting of memories—the ultimate memorial to a life in art. Most of the time it falls somewhere in the middle. We turn to the rough drafts of greats because they might offer hints of the magnum opus always on the horizon. And without the presence and guiding hand of the art’s creator, quality rests solely in the skill of curation and editing.The 26th of this month will mark the two-year anniversary of Rashad Harden’s (DJ Rashad) passing, and in the 730 days since, the pulse of his legacy remains strong. Fifteen of Rashad’s previously unreleased collaborations have been compiled as Afterlife. The editors of the collection intelligently admit a fallibility in the face of the materials, and even offer a tantalizing hint of things still lurking in the vault, saying ""it would be impossible to present a definitive collection of DJ Rashad's music"" and that ""many many classics will remain unreleased for ever."" And like all posthumous art, Afterlife raises a very hard question: Does the trove of tracks significantly affect the ways we evaluate and interpret Rashad’s legacy?In short, the answer is no, and the fifteen songs in Afterlife all feel incomplete in some way or another. They match the mood and fervor you want from a Rashad track quite often, but it is hard to ignore their skeletal and fragmentary nature. Many of the songs feel like sonic bridges between tracks in a DJ set; they can ferry one moment to the next, but seem to lack the legs to stand on their own. And as befits an album cobbled together from unfinished stuff, you can see the stitching exposed. It doesn't have the same complete narrative push of Double Cup, the concision of the Rollin’ EP. In composition it is closer to Rashad’s Just a Taste, Vol. One, a survey of work rather than an album perhaps.Not to say that there aren’t highlights throughout. The opener, ""Roll Up that Loud"" is classic Rashad, ebullient from start to finish. It has the inimitable quality of a Rube Goldberg machine, with all the moving parts of the track whizzing back and forth. It's hard to know where artistic intentions and listener interpretations begin with posthumous work, but large chunks of this project reflect a surprising melancholy. This same feeling in Rashad’s work was most present in the Rollin’ EP, where high-speed funkiness was blended with a languorous mood. ""Oh God,"" one of the most simple songs here, is composed of a lone synth arpeggio and gentle drum patterning, and its tone is as plaintive as 160 BPM music can get. Rashad’s collaboration with DJ Paypal, ""Do U Wanna B Mine,"" meanwhile, counts as one of the odder songs Rashad had worked on. The melding of their two musical personalities leads into something that surprisingly sounds like earnest chiptune.What Afterlife succeeds in above all is capturing the spirit of familial connection and experimentation integral to the Teklife crew. Teklife has always been a family affair. Not a single release from the collective has existed without collaboration. What made them so vital on stage and across blistering tracks was the ethic of teamwork. In all the times I’ve seen Rashad and the extended Teklife crew, I was witness to the exuberance of familial genius. The mixer was their hearth and they all took turns stoking the fire, whispering into each other’s ears, grinning because they all knew what five minutes into the future looked like: a mass of writhing bodies losing their shit in the face of something nearly ineffable. It was something I endlessly appreciated as a seventeen-year-old who had never even heard the whisper of a synth or the bump of a drum machine. To discover Teklife and Rashad then felt like walking across a mile of hot coals—throttled by the sheer force of realization at the other end."

The drums build from a tribal romp to a panicked bubbling, rife with stealthy, undercover bass—the kind that unintentionally nods to a techno-master’s version of footwork. Jonny Pierce of the Drums swoops in to set the scene for a distant dystopian landscape, crooning with a combination of innocent yearning and pop-worthy sentimentality. That pop sensibility is solidified once a wave of dubstep bolsters his hook: “We gotta leave before we dieeeee.” On the surface the song feels like a relatively natural progression after Trentemøller’s 2010 Into The Great Wide Yonder, an album that benefited from these types of wide-reaching cinematics. Whether Trentemøller’s newest album’s successes are indeed its songwriting is another matter.The fact that more than half of the songs on Lost carry guest vocalists is surely a sign of something. Or, at the least, that this producer is looking to test the boundaries of his abilities in the indie-pop/rock sphere. Sometimes his knack for blending minimal techno and house works towards that, sounding both progressive and true-to-self. Other times, the DJ's innovation is lost in the mix. Take “Gravity”, an opening track which features Jana Hunter of Lower Dens. The song carries Trentemøller signifiers—a ping-ponging, bleepy synth pattern and minimal, plodding bass—but add Hunter and the singer’s haunting moans are immediately lifted into a swirl of psychedelic grooves. An enveloping of strings and a somber horn ballad sweep the track into becoming something that’s dictated by Hunter’s presence; “Gravity” is a perfectly fine Lower Dens track.“Come Undone” features Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead and the producer’s role similarly becomes second-string to his singer. Perhaps it’s the distinct way Makino bends her melodies into syrupy moans, but “Come Undone”'s slow burn sounds like something that could have come from a futuristic, alt-universe issue of Misery Is A Butterfly. But then there’s “Deceive”, featuring the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner, where we see Trentemøller's behind-the-scene skills stretched to their greatness. What begins as an exercise in the dark techno he's especially great at becomes much more. A feverish, unhinged synth buzz resonates as the speed picks up, making Wagner’s whispers of treacherous love sound increasingly harrowing in the process—all the while, “Deceive” ends up as one of Lost's most danceable tracks.Needless to say, the straight instrumentals on Lost are where Trentemøller ’s technical prowess is highlighted. As Philip Sherburne mentioned in his review of The Last Resort, this is a man who “deftly fuses minimal techno, big-room house, and the itchy-scratchy fidgeting of IDM without sounding tokenistic.” Here the DJ stays true to this idea while leaping into other universes altogether. “Trails” unfolds as a krautrock stomp where crashing chimes and furious guitars take cues from Indian folk before hopscotching into a spacey laser-light show. (It's too bad he didn't pull Hunter onto something like this.) “Constantinople” jumps on a similar ship: a shrill accordion melody sampled from old Bollywood cruises through a bombardment of electric guitar and driving drums. Add the bass and the whole thing plays out like his own version of a wild jam session in a Turkish nightclub.It's worth noting ""Never Stop Running"" was released on vinyl, its B-side featuring the instrumental track of the song. Listening to it stripped of its vocals, there's no doubting that the clever structuring of epic dance-floor blends is one of Trentemøller's greatest strengths. ""Still On Fire"", for example, is a simply-presented industrial escapade with grunting reverb, gloomy singing synths, and the tinkling of a million percussive embellishments—yet it still manages to deliver an emotive punch. The question for the producer going forward is whether any of these strong, statement instrumentals are more restricted by or benefit from collaborative effort. Because sometimes he's better off dancing on his own."

It’s a simple yet personal statement, in keeping with the Swedish producer’s love of vocal samples that cut to the quick. But it’s also a little jarring to hear something that sweet on one of his records. Armand Jakobsson launched the project as a means of processing a breakup; his early singles and debut album were murky, melancholic house, filled with euphoria but also imbued with an inescapable sense of longing and sadness. That sample is a hint that something important has changed.Gone are the clunky snare beats and muffled hi-hats that were everywhere on his debut, along with the saturated tape effect that coated everything else. Instead, thick and at times almost groovy basslines are everywhere, and soaring Day-Glo synths have taken center stage. Jakobsson has always had a strained relationship to the “lo-fi” tag that attached itself to his productions early on, and here he seems to revel in making music that feels nothing like his old stuff. “Walking With Your Smile” has a garage shuffle that suggests a sunnier Burial, until a gloriously cheesy processed piano reminds you who is actually making this. Closer “Song for the Lonely” feels like Jakobsson trying to prove he can make a proper club banger, with its relentless energy, constantly shape-shifting melody, and pounding kick drum. Everywhere on Mirrors the production has become crisp, smooth, and polished until it shines. Only “These Things Will Come to Be” feels like something out of the old playbook. The song’s syncopated chords build for two minutes, then fade out behind a wistful voicemail from a woman longing for days gone by. But even this moment takes an unexpected turn: The message ends on a note of acceptance and hope, and the music builds back up to transmit a sense of catharsis.Jakobsson has always been adamant that, despite the goofy name, DJ Seinfeld was never meant as a joke or a one-trick pony. Indeed, he has hinted at a shift in his music for a while, namely on the four EPs he released on his own Young Ethics label over the past two years: All have stretched and pulled his sound, testing out variations of everything from Italo-house to large-scale trance. Making good on the sense of bliss that he has been striving to capture in his music for years, Mirrors is a culmination of these experiments—a way for DJ Seinfeld to show exactly how far he has come.Die-hard fans might be disappointed that Jakobsson appears to have shed nearly all of the outward trappings that made his music so distinctive in the first place, trading the intimacy and mystery of his early work for something more refined and crowd-pleasing. With Mirrors, Jakobsson is making his ambition clear: He’s trying to go as big as Jamie xx did on In Colour. It’s easy to imagine many of these songs soundtracking humongous outdoor festivals, perfectly synchronized with the setting sun. Yet even in his earliest days, what made Seinfeld’s music special were the melodies hidden below the surface. Mirrors brings them into the light, in all their glory. What Jakobsson has always tried to accomplish with DJ Seinfeld was to try to tap into some grand universal emotion, a sense of want inside us all. This time, he finds it in joy instead of grief.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

But even then, you could feel him striving to separate himself from the constraint of genre, and indeed, his best music emerged when he shelved his cursory or redundant beats and explored more ambient, textural terrain. Eventually, he became frustrated and uninspired, and briefly abandoned electronic music; he joined How to Dress Well’s touring band, and started working at the Toronto label Arts & Crafts, looking for something new.He appears to have found what he was looking for. His new album, Falling Apart, finds him in an exploratory mode, moving away from idiom and crafting a sound anchored by synths, piano keys, and a sense of narrative build. The record begins Eno-ambient and slowly builds into a momentous, sometime triumphant gloom that recalls a range of other electronic experimentalists from Shigeto to Daniel Lopatin. In an interview with Fact Magazine, Reed said that he did not want to be “saddled to a style or a genre,” and he has made good on that pledge.The challenge for him, then, is to bring the different sounds and textures that he explores into harmony with each other. On the best tracks here, Reed takes his knowledge of a diverse array of styles and creates music with a sense of story. This holds true on both a track-to-track basis (the build from “Dub Music” to “Twin Peaks” to “Falling Apart” is exquisite), and within individual tracks. “Swept Stairs” is one of the longest tracks on the album, but it's constantly introducing something new, beginning as a buzzing ominous landscape and then shedding that skin in favor of a joyous, piano-powered anthem. “Things That Were Not” is another highlight, a haunted and unhinged cacophony that Reed manages to tame into a sensible moving machine.Reed has freed himself to pursue music that isn’t easy to categorize or predict, but his sense of adventure can work against him. Falling Apart is uneven. “The Bells”, for instance, is one of the best tracks here, a propulsive dance-floor track banger. But it operates at about twice the speed as the rest of the album and it seems like an interjection from another record. Then too, there are songs like ""Plucks"" and ""The Walker"", which fail from lack of momentum. They might have made sense if they’d been placed in the first half of the album, when things are still moving at tortoise-pace, but they seem out of place and unnecessary here. Reed has found an admirable sound on Falling Apart, but his promise not to honor any one style ultimately hurts the album’s cohesion."

That band-- formed by bored, obsessive teenagers in mid-1980s Birmingham, England-- sped up death metal into a chaotic, borderline comical blur; their best-known early song is probably still the one-second John Peel favorite ""You Suffer"". The frenzied style that these kids pioneered came to be known as grindcore, and their debut album, Scum, is now regarded as a stone classic in underground metal. But all the original members drifted away; the band remains a touring machine staffed by grizzled vets who regularly crank out more albums of still-potent bloodlettings. You have to wonder how it feels to be a grown man, making your living playing in a band that was started by children, children who no longer have any real connection to what you're doing. And you have to wonder how it feels to be one of those children, moving on to other things in life and watching your childhood creation continuing to pound away.One of those children is Justin Broadrick, whose post-Napalm Death body of work is a varied and fascinating thing. With Godflesh, he built a brutal slow-thud form of electronic rock, a sound so heavy you couldn't rightly call it metal. He's also made various forms of scraping noise under different names: Techno Animal, Final, Pale Sketcher. And for nearly a decade, he's been the man behind Jesu, where he's done something more startling than anything he did under his other guises: He's created beauty. Jesu's music is a kind of tidal slow-churn take on sad-bastard indie rock, Broadrick burying his muttery one-note vocals under avalanches of guitar fuzz and slathering them in prettily reverbed synth figures.Jesu have released most of their music on Hydra Head, a label that specializes in contemplative metal, but lately they've been recording for Calo Verde, the label founded by the Red House Painters' Mark Kozelek. Broadrick has cited the Red House Painters as an inspiration, and it's easy to see how those two could form a mutual admiration society. Jesu, especially on the new Ascension, do a pretty incredible job evoking the feeling of depression through music, its melodies buried under so many oceans of impossibly slow sound that you just barely notice they're there. Nothing Broadrick has ever done with Jesu would give you any clue he was ever in Napalm Death, but on his last two albums, a punishing riff or a gnarled roar would occasionally flare up out of nowhere. And there was also a punk-rock directness about the music; more than one critic compared Jesu to Jawbreaker. But on Ascension, Broadrick never allows himself a moment of catharsis or hope; it's music for rocking back and forth in a fetal position."

Quickly after releasing Un Verano Sin Ti, he made stops that reflect two major themes of the album. The first was a cute, intimate celebration at the last Puerto Rican social club remaining in Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the Caribbean Social Club (also known as “Toñita’s” after one of its owners, Maria Antonia Cay). As one of the most regarded Latinx-owned bars to survive the area’s gentrification while also preserving Boricua history, its existence symbolizes resistance. The day after, he appeared in the Bronx to record a music video for one of the album’s highlights, the upbeat hip-hop dembow fusion “Tití Me Preguntó.” Sporting a T-shirt honoring bachata legend Anthony Santos—whose “No Te Puedo Olvidar” is sampled at the beginning of the track—he was seen turning up with Dominican youth, taking part in the street revelery known simply as teteo. This release-week schedule reflects two of Un Verano Sin Ti’s animating forces: Benito’s bori pride and appreciation of Dominican culture.Recorded in his native island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, Un Verano Sin Ti is a cohesively packaged voyage through the various sounds synonymous with the Caribbean region—reggaetón, reggae, bomba, Dominican dembow, Dominican mambo, and bachata, among others. The album’s 23 tracks are conceptualized through an A side and B side scheme that separates high-energy party and fun sonidos from tranquility and conscious thinking. Its enticing musical patchwork further lures listeners into El Conejo’s universe of experimental arrangements, sharp and nostalgic synths, and unexpected genre fusions. It’s a loving ode to Caribbean culture that embraces marginalized scenes within Latin America, from the ostracization of Black-rooted genres like bachata, dembow, and mambo to the criminalization of reggaeton.Since his early Latin-trap beginnings (which he nods to here on “Dos Mil 16”), Bad Bunny’s adventurous tastes have catapulted him to become one of the most prolific global tastemakers. That versatility, paired with impeccable delivery, wordplay, and lyricism, has permitted him to exist creatively in a way no one else in Latin music, specifically within El Movimiento—to push the boundaries of gender conformity and fashion, for example, while simultaneously branching out to wrestling and acting. His range is represented throughout his discography, which spans pop-punk-meets-trap tracks like “Tenemos Que Hablar” (from 2019’s X 100PRE), “Hablamos Mañana” (2020’s YHLQMDLG), and “Yo Visto Así” (El Último Tour Del Mundo, his second album of 2020 and the first all Spanish-language album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200). As he’s gone on to become Spotify’s most-streamed artist two years in a row, Bad Bunny has set records never before seen in the industry. Yet, despite all the accolades and fame, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio can still be found in a narrow, Puerto Rican-owned bar in Brooklyn."

Her last record, 2010’s Kairos, was woozy both instrumentally and conceptually, leaning toward gossamer dream pop. Baby, her newest, sheds the downtempo beats of Kairos, experimenting with more jagged percussion and orchestral flourishes, notably horns. Dienel learned Protools and built a studio in the basement of her parents’ house, and the methodical approach to the recording, arrangement and production yields a work that feels homegrown (Pitchfork contributor Matt LeMay mixed the record). But for all the sonic change-ups, her idiosyncratic voice remains the music’s signature.Dienel is in a line of vocalists who subvert traditional diction—Fiona Apple with her asymmetrical couplets, Björk’s ability to contort syllables. She tucks whelps and cries between verses, moving from opera-worthy falsettos to pained whimpers, at times recalling Zola Jesus’s blackened folk and even the indie pop falsetto crawl of Portugal. The Man frontman John Gourley. Baby’s opener, “Wait Until Dark,” features nearly a minute of tense near-silence, with Dienel spitting irregular verbs in the dark, creating an effect that’s uncomfortably intimate—not to mention riveting. “Show me respect, maybe then I’ll let you ride with me,” she growls and howls, curling the words behind the acid-keys of the record’s grooviest number, “Metronome.” Dienel can also belt with a diva’s range, especially on the Saturday night club-ready tracks such as “White Noise”. But the album also presents an interesting paradox: Dienel’s voice, the record’s most gripping element, can also be alienating. Occasionally, her ambitious approach lead in over-singing, such as on “Ring the Bell,” where her background vocals get in the way.On the whole, Baby is an exceptionally cautious work and is, at times an uncomfortable listen; it’s an account of a woman wrestling with and tackling self-doubt and insecurity, exploring how it feels to lose control. “Is this my weakness?” Dienel asks as the instruments fade to black in the record’s title track. Over the song’s duration, the question evolves from an admission to a mantra, as Dienel’s voice gains traction and grows in power. Corrosive lyrics also make it an exceptionally heavy listen, when she delivers likes like, “Pushed your head under the water till all your breath gave out” on the title track. But even though it’s filled with stark admissions, Baby is ultimately an unflinchingly hopeful record that sees an already talented artist finding finding new ways to grow."

At times, they seem to want nothing more than to channel a 45-minute MTV rock block from 1995.","""I wish it was the 60s. I wish we could be happy.""""The kids of today should defend themselves against the '70s…look what it did to us.""""The '80s almost killed me, let's not recall them quite so fondly.""Though delivered with various levels of irony, each of those lyrics makes the same point: Retromania is inevitably a practice in revisionist history. For those of us coming of age during this Kennedy administration, I present Baby, the debut album from Camden quartet Tribes. Though ""We Were Children"" is ostensibly meant as a narrative of youthful indiscretion, there's nowhere near enough specificity in Johnny Lloyd's lyrics to hear ""these things happen, we were children in the mid 90s"" as anything other than Baby's mission statement. It essentially recreates a 45-minute MTV rock block from 1995 in its most accurate and often unflattering terms.I can't stress the MTV aspect of it enough. Tribes are hardly alone in their studious appreciation of Clinton-era guitar rock these days, but unlike Surfer Blood, Male Bonding, or Yuck, they have absolutely no sonic or philosophical ties to indie rock whatsoever. If you're in a generous mood, you might hear the regally draped ""Corner of an English Field"" occupying the same cross-section of glam-rock and Britpop that Suede's Dog Man Star did, and ""We Were Children"" pretty much steals the riff and song structure from ""Where Is My Mind?"" wholesale. But due to the arrow-straight performances, slick and sober production, and overeagerness to please, a more accurate assessment would say that we're dealing with third-genners like Spacehog or the Toadies. These are two of Baby's maybe five memorable songs, for what it's worth... which for a supposed pop-rock record is worth everything.There is a good amount of hooky fun to be had when Tribes come off like the band on Baby's album cover-- scrappy but stylish, in search of the next available good time. In a weird way, the album actually feels like an alternative of some kind in 2012 if you're all but ignoring major-label rock: Lloyd's vocals are loud and brash, but in a charming way that's utterly necessary if you're gonna sell lyrics like, ""I scream from California,"" pronounced like, ""ice cream from Californ-eye-uh."" Likewise, the liftoff achieved by the choruses on ""We Were Children"" and ""Whenever"" packs a tremendous kick in large part because Tribes harbor no delusions about being a garage band. This is market-tested and fail-proof keg-rock with all grunge and grit sanded off so it can leap out of jukebox speakers with the utmost velocity."

All throughout Baby, her second full-length release under the name Bosque Brown, she comes across like Texas' answer to Portishead vocalist Beth Gibbons, with her cold, ghostly timbre wrapped up in a strong country twang that is as intriguingly incongruent as it is limited. Though her narrow, expressive range can yield some very moving moments in individual songs, it effectively paints her into an aesthetic corner, particularly as she insists upon singing over some extremely stark arrangements. Without the sort of textural and rhythmic options available to Gibbons' collaborators in Portishead, Miller's thin, tinny vocals are forced to the center of every cut on her album, resulting in an exhaustingly uniform style and tone.With only a few exceptions, Miller's songs are far better at suiting a pre-existing mood than evoking one, but that mood is somewhat hard to pin down. The record is most obviously influenced by the darker side of old-school country music, acoustic gospel, and traditional southern folk, but in its modern context, her work fits nicely alongside Cat Power, Scout Niblett, and Beth Orton. Even still, it's not easy to figure out the most ideal conditions to hear these songs. Whereas Chan Marshall's output can be divided into two basic categories-- the listen-intently-and-feel-her-pain recordings, and the music that can sit comfortably in the background during brunch-- Bosque Brown occupies the awkward no-man's land between those extremes, which has a way of making the record feel purposeless even when it communicates sincere, relatable emotions.While the songs on Baby essentially sound the same, they are not all of equal quality. Several of the selections feel somewhat directionless and insubstantial, though the majestic march ""Oh River"" and the heartbreaking album opener ""White Dove"" have immediately ingratiating melodies that emphasize the strengths of Miller's voice. ""This Town"", a relatively upbeat tune led by simple, jaunty piano chords is another highlight, and it mercifully adds a touch of levity in the midst of an otherwise dour and bleak set of tunes.It's not exactly a coincidence that the best songs on Baby happen to be the numbers that boast memorable instrumentation. Just over half the tracks on the album open with Miller's unaccompanied vocals, and most seem like compositions that were written a cappella, with guitars, pianos, and percussion added later on to fill out the sound. Left to her own devices, Miller's melodies tend to meander, but the fuller arrangements give them shape and power. ""Oh River"", the album's most successful piece, benefits greatly from dynamic drumming that gives Miller's voice a nice lift up into its chorus, allowing the entire song to crest dramatically along with her vocal part. This is a marked contrast with ""Texas Sun"", which conveys an appropriate sense of desolation but also sounds very much like a band lagging behind its singer as she goes off and does her own thing. It's difficult to listen to Baby without wondering if an undue amount of emphasis has been placed on the vocal performance. Too often Miller seems like a talented character actress who has somehow been cast in a lead role against type, and the very qualities that would make her charming and memorable in a smaller role become unflattering when exposed to too much spotlight."

First, it's a catchall descriptor for fans of creaky old r&b; and soul singles. For them, Cobras albums are crackling pieces of heaven, combining all the music's sex and danger with the detail of an archivist. Plus, buying stuff like Baby or their memorable 1998 debut Mink Rat or Rabbit saves hours wasted trolling mildew-y record shops and the back alleys of eBay. But ""Shangri-La"" also references the Cobras' connection to Memphis and Stax/Volt, Cooper-Young cool. They're conduits for the city's soul history, but they also have a contemporary link in Greg Cartwright: Baby's co-producer and lately a fulltime Cobra, Cartwright was a member of Memphis garage rock instituions the Reigning Sound, the Oblivians, and Compulsive Gamblers, the last two of which recorded for...Shangri-La Records. That the Cobras' bash-and-slink versions of those old songs paint them as both interpreters and garage rock revivalists only completes the Shangri-la daisy chain.Baby was released on Rough Trade in the UK and Europe earlier this year, but in America it's the band's Bloodshot debut. They've picked out 12 more r&b; obscurities, but also thrown in an original, the shamelessly salacious ""Hot Dog (Watch Me Eat)"" (""You bring the drinks, and I got the buns...""). Covering old cuts of r&b; and soul as they do, you might expect Cobras vocalist Rachel Nagy to try on her damndest Carla Thomas or Aretha Franklin, or at least sing with cockeyed arm on hip. But instead Nagy sings with a cocky, slow-burn confidence that's throaty enough to handle the material but is all kinds of unique, too. Her voice places the Cobras on the cusp between purism and reinterpretation. Plus, if you want to push the intro bit even further, on ""It's Raining"" and ""Real Thing"" she suggests the dusky girl group growl of the Shangri-Las.While Nagy's delivery is the Cobras' centerpiece, much of their famously kinetic groove comes from guitars that wrangle all trebly over drumming that's heavy on cymbals and wet snare. ""Cha Cha Twist"" is part fire, part whisper, and wants to turn your living room into a clothing-optional dance party, while Bobby Womack's ""Baby Help Me"" alternates its pleading verses with big trashy chords in the chorus and still finds time to reference the Percy Sledge version with a silky bass line.The Cobras can crank out shimmy-ready numbers like ""Cha Cha"", ""Everybody's Going Wild"", and opener ""Slippin' Around"" (""We're making love 15 miles from town!"") in their sleep. But because things come easy for them, the Cobras might be tempted to coast a little-- and that's a factor on Baby. They're always raucous-- and Nagy is always on-- but the album can also leave you wondering, ""What if the Detroit Cobras covered this one or that one, or the deeper-in-the-stacks one?"" Luckily, they'll never run out of material for the very same reason.

YHLQMDLG, released in March, flirted with the top of the pops and dominated the Latin charts; he’s graced awards-show stages and the covers of Western media’s storied publications; he’s evolved into a vocal ally of marginalized communities, with a willingness to acknowledge and rectify his mistakes; and with the release of El Último Tour Del Mundo, he’s made history with the first-ever No. 1 Spanish-language album on Billboard’s album chart. No other artist had more Spotify streams in 2020.For El Último Tour Del Mundo, Bad Bunny transports himself a decade into the future, imagining the music he’d play on his final world tour in 2030. It’s not his best record, but that’s almost beside the point. You’ll still find vestiges of his particular nuevo reggaetón sound on tracks like “Te Mudaste” and “Dákiti,” even if the latter is one of its weakest examples, pummeling the dembow riddim into submission with a thumping four-on-the-floor that’s devoid of any actual flavor. But by track four he takes a sharp left turn from the rap and perreo that defined previous LPs in favor of a morose, introspective vibe that pulls from British post-punk and the rock en español of Central and South America as much as it does the hip-hop and R&B of the American South.For better or worse, El Ultimó Tour Del Mundo’s rock sound leans heavily on producer Marco “MAG” Borrero (and, to a lesser extent, Borrero’s human riff machine Mick Coogan), best known for crafting pop hits for the likes of Flo Rida, Bebe Rexha, and Selena Gomez. The collaboration doesn’t always work; tracks like “Te Deseo Lo Mejor” and “Antes Que Se Acabe” suffer from a saccharine sound that’s generic enough to blend in with Top 40 radio. But when it does, it’s sublime. “Yo Visto Así” and “La Droga” inhabit the same universe of distorted emo rap as the late Lil Peep and Juice WRLD, with grunge guitars ringing out over rumbling trap beats. And “Maldita Pobreza,” a poor man’s lament that effortlessly bounces between buoyant new-wave riffs and booming 808s, evokes Café Tacvba, New Order, and modern-day traperos in equal measure, offering a glimpse of the brilliance that can result from Benito’s experimentation."

Weeks of isolation tested the limits of his ability to entertain himself—and us—without leaving the house. As he told Rolling Stone, he grabbed some old beats, called up some OGs, and pulled up to his engineer La Paciencia’s crib to track some vocals. And less than three months after dropping YHLQMDLG, the high-water mark of his career, Bad Bunny had a new album out.The title of that album, LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR, loosely translates to “The ones that weren’t coming out,” a play on words that references both the songs on the record as well as Bad Bunny himself, holed up in an Airbnb with his partner since March. Nine of the 10 tracks were pulled from the cutting room floor of the YHLQMDLG sessions; unfinished, unmixed, and unmastered beats with no vocals that Bad Bunny resurrected while in isolation, with a little help from his friends. Most of them appeared in some form during his marathon home quarantine concert broadcast live on Instagram earlier this month.The record plays quick and dirty, with uncharacteristically crunchy production value and lo-fi aesthetics. Even the album cover is lo-res. YHLQMDLG was a slickly produced homage to marquesina mixtapes; LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR sounds like it could actually be one, the kind of record a teen Bad Bunny might play at one of those underground garage parties. He says he put the record together in two days, and it shows. But far from detracting from the experience, the loose grit is part of the appeal. “Reggaetoncitos” that smooth out reggaeton’s rougher edges may have helped it merge with the mainstream, but Bad Bunny’s career has been defined by pulling the mainstream closer to him, as opposed to vice versa. Even as he’s reshaped urbano in his own image, he’s shown a healthy respect and admiration for its underground outlaw beginnings, and consistently made the case that there’s room for perreo on the pop charts.A quick glance at the guest features reveals the dichotomy of old school and new school—legends like Don Omar, Yandel, and Zion y Lennox represent the OGs, while nascent hitmaker Jhay Cortez offers a glimpse of the talent in urbano’s next generation. And while YHLQMDLG standout “Safaera” felt like a five-minute tribute to DJ Playero’s genre-defining mixtapes of the 1990s, he tips his cap to them even more directly here. “BAD CON NICKY,” his collaboration with Medellin-via-Puerto Rico reggaetonero Nicky Jam, samples Daddy Yankee’s “Donde Mí No Venga,” a seminal track in reggaeton’s history from Playero 37 that makes plain the lineage that connects reggae en español and reggaeton."

In some ways, it is: Album opener “Amarillo” (Yellow) teems with funhouse horns sampled from French hip-hop collective Saïan Supa Crew’s “Angela,” as Rompiendo pumps the sample into an addictingly—or, depending on your sensitivity, annoyingly—incessant loop.

His offbeat mix of influences has made way for neon dye jobs, Spongebob grills, and luminous tours like last year’s Arcoíris Tour (named for Colores’ penultimate track), where a leopard-haired Balvin centered himself in what can only be described as an army of kawaii Michelin Men and emoji-adjacent mascots, recalling the work of Japan’s matchless visual artist Takashi Murakami.Speaking of whom: Balvin’s latest cover art is credited to Murakami.

Such was Ozuna’s dilemma as he headed into 2019. His first two LPs (2017’s Odisea and 2018’s Aura) sold more than half a million units each, and he had just been crowned YouTube’s most-viewed artist of 2018, featuring in four of the platform’s top 10 most-streamed videos of the year. He teased his third LP, Nibiru, three months after Aura’s release, and the excitement was palpable. But things didn’t exactly play out as planned.Behind the scenes, the 27-year-old Dominican-Puerto Rican was being extorted over an “intimate” video from his teen years, which ended with his extortionist’s murder (Ozuna was never a suspect). He was nominated for a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Song, but lost out to an artist who isn’t even Latin. And after two years of releasing an album each August, he was still working on Aura’s followup through the fall. By the time Nibiru was released at the end of November, expectations had reached a fever pitch that would prove almost impossible to meet.Nibiru is a self-described urbano record—that umbrella term that encompasses the reggaetón, trap, and R&B currently dominating the Spanish-language pop charts. Reggaetón is made for the dancefloor, fueled by a classic, irresistible riddim. And Latin trap can trace its roots back to Atlanta’s strip clubs, with basslines that ooze sex and sleaze. Ozuna typically occupies the space in between, a romantic reggaetonero who softens the edges of the traperos he often collaborates with. Tracks like “Se Preparó” and “Síguelo Bailando,” from his debut LP, crystallize this notion, conjuring a suave and sophisticated aesthetic imbued with both confidence and vulnerability. Nibiru extends him beyond this comfort zone, and in the process, loses some of what made him unique.Named for a fictional planet where Ozuna makes his music before bringing it back down to earth, the LP hints at the scope of his ambition: He’s been beyond the clouds, searching for new territory after so thoroughly and quickly conquering YouTube. There are glimpses of that otherworldly talent on Nibiru. His agile flow en español shines on “Yo Tengo una Gata,” a kush-cloud duet with Panamanian reggaetonero Sech, with a simple synth melody that yowls with heartache. And “Baila Baila Baila” may be almost a year old, but it has endured as one of the biggest dance tracks of the year and reveals Ozuna’s mastery at writing hooks."

Their 1994 hit “Lamento Boliviano” was drenched in self-medication and singer/bassist Marciano Cantero’s romantic pathos offered the kind of lyrics that get screamed back at you when sung to packed stadiums: “Y yo estoy aquí, borracho y loco (And here I am, drunk and crazy)/Y mi corazón idiota, siempre brillará” (And my idiot heart, always shining). For J Balvin, Sky flipped part of the original hook to turn Balvin from the heartbroken to the heartbreaker: “Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará” (“And your idiot heart will always miss me”). Over the course of a single day, what began as a half-serious gag—what if we got Cantero in the booth?—ended with a phone call from the Argentine asking for stems. “It was kind of a joke in the studio,” Sky told Rolling Stone. “But they take the jokes very seriously.”“Un Peso” captures the appeal of Oasis; frothy music made by serious talents. The reigning princes of urbano spend much of the album’s 31-minute runtime promoting tropical hedonist pursuits: too-tiny bikinis, excessive alcohol consumption, ostentatious displays of wealth, and unprotected sex.

When Bad Bunny sings lines like “Ese booty es un paraíso como Bora Bora” (“The booty is a paradise like Bora Bora”), you can almost hear him smirk.

His nasal Auto-Tune croon christens every song he appears on, regardless of the style he’s working with. The 34-year-old Balvin, ever the chameleonic wave-rider, is more content to go with the flow.

They dress like spangley futuristic mime robots, which I suppose is sort of annoying, but that really doesn't have anything to do with their music. They bankrupted their record label and waited way too long to put their first album out, but again, all that stuff is strictly extra-musical. They actively and knowingly marketed themselves as electroclash, but Fischerspooner has much more in common musically with the Scissor Sisters than Miss Kittin or A.R.E. Weapons. They've never managed to make anything as great as their first single, but then ""Emerge"" was such a dizzy, searing monster jam that it'd be hopeless to hold any group to that standard forever.So the only real reason I can think of to hate Fisherspooner is the vwerdle-vwerdle-vwerdle oscillating synth-bass sound they use on every single song. This can grow tired after an entire album, but it's a good, malleable sound, as effective on breathy, luxuriant opium-disco tunes like ""A Cloud"" as on swooping, lazy filter-Fleetwood-Mac tracks like ""Happy"". And plus you can ratchet up the pitch a bunch on the chorus and the song will automatically sounds way more intense.On Odyssey, the group piles on huge, clattering drums, mournful house pianos, deliriously sleazy strutting white-funk guitars. The album's production is clean enough to sterilize needles; everything has a lavish, glossy cocaine sheen. The group has recruited help from pop-music pros like Mirwais (who produced Madonna's ""Music"", which is fucking awesome) and Linda Perry (who wrote Pink's ""Get This Party Started"", which is fucking awesome). They got the now deceased Susan Sontag to write the lyrics for ""We Need a War"", which is nice, but it's not like anyone ever listens to the lyrics on Fischerspooner songs.Odyssey is Fischerspooner's attempt at kicking and screaming their way out of punchline hell, so it's a bit of a surprise how good everything sounds. The deluxe, swirley disco tracks that begin the album slide nicely into the brittle new-wave funk and imperiously sighed synthed ballads. All of this builds beautifully to the group's cover of the Boredoms' smeary psychedelic symphony ""Circle"". It's something of a shock hearing the Boredoms' messy drum-circle monolith translated through Fischerspooner's glammy synths, but the group approaches the song with the majestic fervor it demands, and the result is a truly gorgeous pileup.Odyssey isn't a great album: Many of the vocal hooks are weak and underfed, the group never finds the widescreen abandon of ""Emerge"", and there's that synth burble on every song. But the group has managed to come up with an appealingly grand, ridiculous epic, more than anyone could reasonably expect from these forgotten freaks. So find some other band to hate. May I suggest Kings of Leon?"

Though varied and sometimes powerful, its themes feel undercooked.","Joey Bada$$ began his career rapping about his rapping. The subject matter was secondary to how deftly he jammed together as many words as he could into his bars and most often, he executed effectively. Now on his second LP, Joey has elected to use his elevated exposure to address the societal ills of our time. As he said recently, “I personally feel like I was put here on this Earth not only to inspire, but to wake people up.” On All-Amerikkkan Bada$$, Joey raps about police brutality, systematic oppression and its consequences, and of course, Donald Trump. It’s a thoughtful and mature step for the 22-year-old Brooklyn rapper, five years removed from his days as the precocious teenager behind 1999. On the new record, Joey favors lyrical clarity over the tongue-twisting rhymes of his younger days. Despite the directness, however, he does not surpass surface-level awareness, rendering AABA little more than a good intention.Joey aims for positivity on AABA. The first half, which he calls “The Heroes Side,” is relaxed—a return to form after the darkness of Summer Knights and B4.DA.$$. It’s light and melodic music with boom-bap drums providing the rhythm—the kind of unimposing tunes to soundtrack a backyard party; they just happen to veer near dark topics. The opening tracks (“Good Morning Amerikkka,” “For My People,” and “Temptation”) reflect the sunny mood, sounding like polished and complete updates of the spare Golden Age music Joey revered so greatly on past releases. Later, he cements his commitment to hope when he raps, “I exchange my negative for a positive,” on the back-half cut “Super Predator.” (As with other backwards-looking efforts, it brings to mind Q-Tip’s own 1991 request to “get in the zone of positivity, not negativity.”) The upbeat attitude both underscores and undermines the album. Optimism is an asset in times of progress, but it can sound like blissful ignorance, as on “Temptation,” where Joey chides someone who is “complaining all day but in the same condition,” and apparently “enslaved by their religion.” Yet, he offers no alternative to this ill-established problem, rapping only, “Watch me use my prophets/Get them all to listen/I’ve been on a mission.” The panacean message and “mission” remain unclear.Joey excels greatest on AABA when he does not try to use the album as a thesis paper that tries to scan as many injustices as possible. “Rockabye Baby” and “Ring the Alarm,” which slot into “The Vindictive Villainous Side,” are tough songs that embody Joey’s anger. They are also his greatest lyrical showcases. He doesn’t prescribe advice, nor does he seek solutions. The former is a boastful call-to-arms, and the latter is a lyrical barrage with lines like, “It’s the double entendre monster/Taking haunting constant trips through your conscious,” which is among his best ever. While constant one-liners were a bit leaden on B4.DA.$$, they are sorely missed on AABA."

There’s that coda to “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” (“You and I know we gotta die someday” sandwiched between one lyric about giving yourself to God and another pledging to “have fun every motherfucking night”); there’s the title track, which opens the album by signaling that the whole thing might be a fever dream, and ends with Lisa Coleman cooing, “Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?” It might have been tempting, in 1982, to see Prince’s experiments with synthesizers and programmed drums to be of a piece with these anxieties, emerging sounds turned against emerging fears. It might be tempting, now, to let those once cutting-edge technologies—which now read as obvious date markers—cast those same anxieties as relics of a far-off era.But those competing threads that Prince drew out so well—a smirking nihilism and a kind of empathy that posits lust and humanism as the same thing—have never disappeared from pop music, and his ability to marshal the Reagan years and the LM-1 for his own purposes, the way he had already done with the tropes of rock and funk, has rarely been replicated, before or after the Berlin Wall came down. And so 1999, which is now being reissued by Warner Records as part of a five-disc set that also includes B-sides, demos, unreleased songs, and concert footage, is the rare record that has come to define its era while also existing outside of it, a masterpiece that immediately precedes the albums Prince fashioned, conspicuously, as masterpieces.The album proper sounds, as it always has, like a computer breathing. (The songs have been remastered, and while they sound rich and clear on car speakers and in headphones, it feels beside the point to listen to “D.M.S.R.” out of anything but the nearly-blown monitors inside an overheated First Avenue.) Even a massive, mainstream hit like “Little Red Corvette”—the first Prince song that charted higher on Billboard’s pop chart than the R&B one—begins as if it’s climbing out of a digital muck. “Delirious” sounds like it comes from a very sexual lab experiment that went exactly according to plan. The music is unfailingly funky while still remarkably controlled, precise in the way that a purposefully askew movie prop is precise.And still, 1999 sprawls: ten of its 11 songs clock longer than five minutes, spiraling outward or, in the case of “Automatic,” locking into a long groove that asks, as we all have at one time or another, ‘What if the aliens fuck?’ It is exploratory without ever becoming impenetrable, “indulgent” but never boring. There is as always the tonal slipperiness that makes Prince’s music so rich to revisit: All the in-jokes and scathing subliminals of “All the Critics Love U In New York” come just two tracks after “Free,” which is marked by disarmingly sincere patriotism. Of course, there’s only one utterance of the word “sincere” on the album: “I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth.”"

The 23-year-old rising star Lor Scoota died in 2016 and local phenom Young Moose became the target of a Baltimore Police Department raid that resulted in him being imprisoned for eight months.Despite all this, Baltimore’s rap scene is thriving today. The loudest (and most nasally) voice in the city belongs to Shordie Shordie, who rose to prominence as the designated hook-man of Peso Da Mafia before leaving the group to try his hand at a solo career. Shordie’s melody-first approach to songwriting made him stand out in his former group. Reading the lyrics to his 2018 breakout single, “Bitchuary,” you’d think the song sounded closer to a questionable argument you hear through thin walls than a tense, flirty back-and-forth, but that’s Shordie’s appeal: Any vulnerability he’s willing to show is always going to be cloaked with a hook you want to sing in the shower.Memory Lane, Shordie’s follow-up to 2020’s >Music, is set on convincing you that he and “Nice for What” producer Murda Beatz have unrivaled chemistry—and for the most part, their ideas are in lockstep. The lone-producer project is new territory for Shordie, but he seems comfortable with Murda Beatz taking control. Early standout “Same Niggas” is the bread-and-butter that makes up the bulk of his discography. The subtext of every “Fuck you” he snarls is “And it don’t have to be this way.” This is just the first of several songs he spends licking his wounds—he’s a scorned lover, and he doesn’t care who knows it. “Keep your cheating to yourself and your phone, I don’t wanna cry,” he sings a song later on “Stuck in Between.”Shordie continues to push himself as a writer, slowly becoming worthy of the “Captain Hook” nickname he adopted while with his former group. Even so, Memory Lane is a bit of a mixed bag; for every fleshed-out story of love and loss, there’s a song that’s all hook with a blasé verse added as an afterthought, like the Frank Ocean-flipping “Moral to the Story.” Shordie makes up for that miss with “LOVE,” where his cries for “L-O-V-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E” and make-up sex are a welcome, yet unexpected callback to “Loveeeeeee Song.”Murda’s skeletal production is effective at establishing simple feelings like sadness and lust. Superstars like Drake and Cardi B flood the space on Murda’s beats with their charisma. Shordie, on the other hand, needs beats that aid his storytelling. Too often on Memory Lane is he left to do the emotional heavy lifting with his singing. These synergistic problems are only magnified by the one rapper/one producer format; a producer with a tag as recognizable as Murda’s should be bringing Shordie closer to being a household name. Instead, Murda’s contributions feel closer to the guy who you have to force to turn in his part of a group project. The album’s closer, “Ride with Shordie,” with a beat made up of just string plucks and handclaps, whisks you away to a beachside bonfire, and leaves you wondering if there were other songs with more imaginative production culled from the final tracklist. Shordie’s no stranger to stretching his voice to add an extra layer of emotion to the track, but Murda’s beats sound like they’re waiting for a second act that never begins.In 2019, Shordie told The Fader that it could sound like he was just doing “the easy part” with Peso Da Mafia, since he was focused on hooks. Going solo has let him flourish creatively; his hooks have only become a deadlier tool in his arsenal. At their simplest, Shordie’s love stories are lucid daydreams of what a situationship could’ve been, but when he puts it all together on Memory Lane, they’re storyboarded short films detailing the ups and downs of young love.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

Instead of aiming for retro-funk bullseye, they made the weirder, more ambitious Higher.","Steve Arrington is one of the great underheralded figures in funk, a drummer/vocalist who transitioned from lounge acts to gigs with the Escovedos before joining the Dayton funk band Slave for a five-year stretch of hitmaking. After a successful solo career stretching through most of the 80s, he left the business at the turn of the 90s for the ministry, about the same time as g-funk was starting to mine his catalog for inspiration and a kid from Pasadena named Damon Riddick was traversing over that same turf for his own early demos. The lineage is so clear and traceable that pairing up Dâm-Funk with the recently unretired Arrington seems like an intersection of a no-brainer homage and a dream come true. Anyone who's heard classics like “Just a Touch of Love,” “Weak at the Knees”, or “Dancin' in the Key of Life” can probably picture how natural and comfortable it'd sound for Arrington to jam over the spaced-out, smooth-gliding bounce of the style that made Toeachizown so immersive. Played straight and aiming right for the retro-funk bullseye would probably result in one of the most effortlessly crowdpleasing throwback records of the year.That's not quite what they did. Higher is messier than that, and weirder, and ultimately more ambitious. Instead of a straightforward selection of boogie jams that effortlessly recall 1982 and leave it at that, Arrington and Riddick put together something spontaneous, potentially polarizing, and joyously strange. Arrington's lost none of his range or power over the years, and he sounds instantly recognizable as the same man who laid a rubbery, often unearthly voice over tracks three decades ago. But he willfully goes off on odd tangents and improvised-sounding flights, spends a bit of time dodging a traditional on-the-one delivery for a more off-beat performance, and overall treats Dâm-Funk's backing track more like a suggestion to be elaborated on than an authoritative, meter-driving pulse. This is that rare record where the singer beats all the critics in the race to call a sound “angular”-- “that angular approach that's so funky and new,” to be specific, as he points out on “Tap That.” It's a phrase that touches on all the quirks and brow-furrowing curveballs that come with that territory.Granted, it's not that out of character for Dâm-Funk, though it does seem less experimental than he's been of late. Keeping in mind some of his more daring post-Toeachizown work, from his amped-up yet faithful cover of Human League's “Things That Dreams Are Made Of” to last year's New Wave-via-Minneapolis jam “I Don't Wanna Be a Star,” this feels a bit more like a reversion to still-funky, but less eclectic, turf. That means a lot of similar tempos, boom-clap drum machine patterns, and flowing chords-- sounds that barely stray from the Toeachizown palette-- and the musical simplicity threatens to fall into a droning sort of repetition, albeit a pleasant one. On the bright side, it never actually drags, and the production's still a good complement: it feels like Dâm-Funk decided to cede the spotlight to Arrington, leaving his work to buoy Arrington's voice, give him a springboard to riff off, and leaving the more eccentric touches to the singer himself."

Seyi Vibez),0.0,0.0,1.0,0.307,meditative,7.8,The L.A. producer's second LP dredges up a jaggedly delicate sound that merges gently wafting electronic tones with intricately decaying rhythmic atmosphere.,"Establishing a sonic personality without lyrical assistance or some unique personal backstory can be tricky, especially when you're in the middle of a room crowded with your peers. The space in question is the one with a ""for fans of Flying Lotus"" sign posted over the door, and there hasn't been a ton of vacancy in there lately. Those who've broken out have done so by tweaking the sonic imprint of decaying beats and melting analog chords until they come across as distinctly tactile things, humid and slippery, blown-out and elastic.Reaching out to clutch the music on Shlohmo's Bad Vibes might cause it to crumble in your grasp-- and then cut the hell out of your fingers. The L.A. producer's sophomore full-length comes after a handful of singles, EPs, remixes, and compilation appearances, as well as last year's disorienting debut, Shlomoshun Deluxe. And in that short yet busy time, Shlohmo has dredged up something strange: an aesthetic that's jaggedly delicate, filled with melodic beauty but jostled by abrasive percussive hitches, undercut with sandpapery patches of ambient fuzz. It's a deft merging of gentle, wafting electronic tones and intricately beat-to-shit rhythmic atmosphere, the sounds of old technology trying to reconcile its former gloss with its fading functionality.The cynical ears that still can't get past the nostalgic surface of chillwave might have their own bone to pick with the cassette-deck/VHS fidelity of Bad Vibes, which stands out pretty prominently in hissy tracks like ""Same Time"" and ""Parties"". But instead of celebrating corroded, neon-pastel magnetic-tape detritus for its own sake, the music on this album leans closer to an appreciation of the actual rhythmic counterpoints, quirks, and resonant qualities of white noise. Alongside the moments that seem to revel in the flutter and crackle of old equipment are stretches that draw similar vibes from the sound of literal rainfall (""Seriously"") or birdcall-strewn field recordings (""Big Feelings"")-- not to mention the texture you can get from good old-fashioned feedback, like the keyboard squall of ""Trapped in a Burning House"".The beats themselves are striking enough, whether they're the distant trickling clicks of ""Sink"" or the sharp, crisp snap-thump grooves that push along cuts like ""Places"" or ""Same Time"". Yet even the moments where the beat feels secondary to the other instrumentation have a pulse to them, run through floaty guitars or humming synthesizers that converse with the ambient hiss in compelling ways. Still, neither the melody nor the ambience overwhelms the other. It's easy to hear the silky, billowy tones through the dying-battery distortion, but hard to picture what they'd sound like without it."

Since the Long Island quartet emerged near the end of the last decade with the charmingly lo-fi indie rock of Vampires With Dreaming Kids, they have pursued a number of alternate avenues—squishy synth-pop, stiff funk, starry disco. You could imagine plucking their eclectic, softly strange 2011 LP, In Heaven, from the aisles of Tower circa 1996, the disc alphabetically and musically lodged between Cibo Matto and Stereolab. Their self-titled 2014 album pushed their dance-oriented tendencies, flipping the way “dream pop” had often been used to describe their hard-to-classify stuff.Mr Twin Sister’s third full-length, Salt, adds new flourishes to that electrified approach— moonlit jazz-pop reminiscent of the increasingly influential British act the Blue Nile, the placid environs of chillout, slinking R&B, Auto-Tuned outré-pop. There’s a distinct downtown New York City vibe that runs throughout these songs. Sure, Salt elicits imagery of rain hitting a cab window after a night out. More important, Mr Twin Sister, like city contemporaries Yaeji and House of Feelings, tap into a distinctly urban vein through gentle mutations of house and techno, their sound reflecting the cosmopolitan, body-moving pulse of the nightlife and the post-club comedown.Salt’s highest points happen when the band’s impressive textures shape tuneful, easy-to-grasp songs, providing a lovely counterpoint to lead vocalist Andrea Estella’s millennial musings on digital desensitization, the melting pot of global culture, and the ills of consumerism. “Jaipur” thrums steadily beneath Estella’s commanding voice, fluttering woodwinds creating a fine mist around her. “Tops and Bottoms” pairs her introspective musings on fashion, body image, and the pressures of existing in public over a bed of brittle rhythms and luscious keyboards, while propulsive opener “Keep on Mixing” fashions hyperspeed pop from a skipping beat that suggests UK Garage and 2step.Such conventions have become the reference points of copyists during the last decade, but Mr Twin Sister synthesize them differently, crafting distinct moods around them in a manner that feels out-of-step with indie trendspotting. The production throughout is astounding, especially when considering Mr Twin Sister’s modest beginnings. The details are vivid in the mix, like the saxophone curlicue that rolls into the piano-and-drums arrangement of “Alien FM” or the horns that burst forth in “Taste in Movies.”Although Mr Twin Sister’s first release preceded chillwave, they gained prominence around the time the micro-movement took hold through the likes of Toro Y Moi and Neon Indian. Mr Twin Sister were briefly but incorrectly tagged this way, too, which made less sense as the band established their own genre-amorphous identity. But Mr Twin Sister have always been more than capable in establishing vibes, the essential quality of chillwave’s otherwise-nebulous form. On Salt, they’re sometimes too good at mood-setting music. The rippling, Vocalcity-like textures of slow-burning tracks such as “Deseo” and “Set Me Free” are just two of several instances that sound immaculate but offer little melodically except wispy atmospherics. But over-scrutinizing Mr Twin Sister’s capacity for vibe-setting feels like witnessing a rare bird in its natural habitat: attempting to examine them any closer risks disrupting the simple joy of watching them exist."

There are only a few artists for whom I'd waive ...","""You're only as good as your last album."" There are only a few artists for whom I'd waive this rule of thumb. Luckily, they've never really tested me. I was less keen on Nocturama than most of the rest of Nick Cave's catalog, and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's latest threw me a little-- but there was enough virtue in each record to keep me enthralled by their respective franchises. Bowie repeatedly disappoints me nowadays, but I have reconciled this by imagining two distinct Bowies, one on either side of the 80s. Salt, however, has me reassessing everything Arto Lindsay's ever released, the extent to which I ever really loved him, and whether I need to forgive him, too.Lindsay's always been irreverent of the mainstream, unscrupulously dipping in and out of pop. The public has held his work in fittingly whimsical regard, as a given release might briefly capture the zeitgeist, only for the next to follow less relevant tangents. Lindsay flirts with avant-rock and pop, never fully subscribing to a genre, though an enduring affair with bossa nova colors most of his work. Reminiscent of a youthful Leonard Cohen about to lose himself entirely in listless day-dreaming, Lindsay has always let his soft, elusive vocals glisten like a layer of honey over their contained melodies.Salt, much in step with Lindsay's more recent mode, recalls neither his ""fake jazz"" combo The Lounge Lizards, nor his dance/noise project Ambitious Lovers-- and it's a long, long way from the no-wave DNA project that he began with back in 1978. Instead, it carries forth the Brazilian electronic theme instilled during Lindsay's mid-90s experiments with such artists as Vinicius Cantauria. ""Twins"" typifies this approach, pairing loose world and trip-hop flavored beats with glitchy electronics and recalling that era's The Subtle Body LP.What disappoints here, compared to, say, 2002's Invoke, is a conspicuous distance between Lindsay's sexually charged and insightful lyrics and their rightful musical home. You get the feeling that the vocal tracks could be indiscriminately swapped between songs and you'd never notice. On ""Kamo (Dark Stripe)"", Arto's Mick Hucknall-esque croon drifts meaninglessly on the technically proficient yet bland and subdued backing. Too many songs go by unnoticed, polished to such a blinding sheen that their surfaces reflect little discernable color or character.The album isn't without its pleasant moments, though. ""Into Shade"" is subtle and delicate, melting into gorgeous strings and perfectly restrained guitar phrasing. Here, Lindsay's voice interacts fully with the instrumentation rather than floating somewhere nearby in ponderous detachment. ""Personagem"" is a rich bossa nova excursion dotted with clever melodic interludes and an infectious, recurring guitar riff. The album rotates around ""Jardim da Alma"" (or ""Garden of the Soul""), a cluttered but accomplished amalgamation of Lindsay's transcontinental influences.Salt does some disservice to Lindsay's progression without entirely disgracing it. There's ample prettiness here to ensure second and third listens, but this will be no one's favorite Arto Lindsay album. As the music flickers with poise and confidence, the vocals fail to emote the seductive implications of Lindsay's words. Maybe it's this lack of cohesion that ""De Lama Lamina"" descends into squawky discordance to protest. Although Salt is mixed, frustrating, and hardly reflects the twenty-odd years Lindsay spent getting here, it's a peccadillo amidst an otherwise admirable legacy. Guess I'll be back for more after all."

A significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor.","The Albatross became a self-fulfilling prophecy for Foxing. While the St. Louis band's relentless touring enabled the slow-build success of their debut, the aching opening track on Dealer recounts the effect of Conor Murphy having to repeat ugly truths about himself night after night for the better part of two years: ""I am caught up in the guilt/ Making a living off of drowning."" Though Dealer is an artistic triumph and a significant advance from The Albatross, it's even heavier, more compositionally complex, and more personally revealing than its predecessor. And that's why, from its very first second, Murphy sounds drained over the prospect of doing it all over again—Dealer is not an easy listen. It sounds like it was very difficult to make, and reliving it is going to be even harder.It's in Foxing's nature to welcome a challenge. Of all the leading figures in the Fest-centered post-emo world, they made the most demanding, unique and self-assured debut. It certainly earned the genre tag—silvery guitar figures streaked and twinkled like tiny Explosions in the Sky, while Murphy's keening vocals delivered confrontational and caustic lyrics with spasmodic, burst-and-bloom dynamics. To paraphrase the slow-motion self-evisceration of ""Rory"" (think the Wrens' ""This Is Not What You Had Planned"" stretched to four minutes), he ripped his heart out while it was still beating and shoved it directly in your face. But Foxing are more interested in a renaissance than a ""revival"", and they mirror the adaptive and forward-thinking qualities of their scene, creating a new voice for familiar sentiments: There was certainly hints of Cap'n Jazz on Albatross, but also actual jazz, as well as Sufjan Stevens' baroque Americana and touches of avant-garde R&B.The Albatross darted fitfully and stretched out in all directions, while Dealer pulls all of Foxing's influences inward. Inverting his typical role of making burly post-rock bands sound delicate, producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Caspian) boosts Foxing's fragility—Dealer is constructed like an expensive timepiece where you can see every exacting movement behind a thick, glossy lacquer. Murphy's much-improved vocals negotiate the curvature of ""Weave""'s mournful melody and the band's syncopated sway—imagine what the Chicago late-'90s post-rock scene could've accomplished if they hooked up with the guys downstate in Urbana-Champaign. While there were short instrumental interludes on The Albatross, ""Winding Cloth"" is a full-on string orchestration, offering four minutes to absorb the shellshocked war reportage of ""Indica"" before segueing into the heavy-hearted poetry of ""Redwoods""."

Instead of aiming for retro-funk bullseye, they made the weirder, more ambitious Higher.","Steve Arrington is one of the great underheralded figures in funk, a drummer/vocalist who transitioned from lounge acts to gigs with the Escovedos before joining the Dayton funk band Slave for a five-year stretch of hitmaking. After a successful solo career stretching through most of the 80s, he left the business at the turn of the 90s for the ministry, about the same time as g-funk was starting to mine his catalog for inspiration and a kid from Pasadena named Damon Riddick was traversing over that same turf for his own early demos. The lineage is so clear and traceable that pairing up Dâm-Funk with the recently unretired Arrington seems like an intersection of a no-brainer homage and a dream come true. Anyone who's heard classics like “Just a Touch of Love,” “Weak at the Knees”, or “Dancin' in the Key of Life” can probably picture how natural and comfortable it'd sound for Arrington to jam over the spaced-out, smooth-gliding bounce of the style that made Toeachizown so immersive. Played straight and aiming right for the retro-funk bullseye would probably result in one of the most effortlessly crowdpleasing throwback records of the year.That's not quite what they did. Higher is messier than that, and weirder, and ultimately more ambitious. Instead of a straightforward selection of boogie jams that effortlessly recall 1982 and leave it at that, Arrington and Riddick put together something spontaneous, potentially polarizing, and joyously strange. Arrington's lost none of his range or power over the years, and he sounds instantly recognizable as the same man who laid a rubbery, often unearthly voice over tracks three decades ago. But he willfully goes off on odd tangents and improvised-sounding flights, spends a bit of time dodging a traditional on-the-one delivery for a more off-beat performance, and overall treats Dâm-Funk's backing track more like a suggestion to be elaborated on than an authoritative, meter-driving pulse. This is that rare record where the singer beats all the critics in the race to call a sound “angular”-- “that angular approach that's so funky and new,” to be specific, as he points out on “Tap That.” It's a phrase that touches on all the quirks and brow-furrowing curveballs that come with that territory.Granted, it's not that out of character for Dâm-Funk, though it does seem less experimental than he's been of late. Keeping in mind some of his more daring post-Toeachizown work, from his amped-up yet faithful cover of Human League's “Things That Dreams Are Made Of” to last year's New Wave-via-Minneapolis jam “I Don't Wanna Be a Star,” this feels a bit more like a reversion to still-funky, but less eclectic, turf. That means a lot of similar tempos, boom-clap drum machine patterns, and flowing chords-- sounds that barely stray from the Toeachizown palette-- and the musical simplicity threatens to fall into a droning sort of repetition, albeit a pleasant one. On the bright side, it never actually drags, and the production's still a good complement: it feels like Dâm-Funk decided to cede the spotlight to Arrington, leaving his work to buoy Arrington's voice, give him a springboard to riff off, and leaving the more eccentric touches to the singer himself."

His funk-flecked house tracks fit right in with Dua Lipa’s slick ’80s basslines and the Weeknd’s retro glitz, Jessie Ware and Kylie Minogue’s strobe-lit resurgences. But Lewis has braided disco into dance music for years. In 2014, he signed to the same label as Ware, PMR, after remixing one of her songs. Since then, his flickering singles and trio of concept EPs have revolved around obvious, easy themes: We’re young, dancing’s fun, tonight is all we have.His full-length debut, Times, arrives nearly a year after most clubs closed, when the minutiae of what used to be a normal night out have taken on a kind of reverence. In the blank expanse of quarantine, music made for dancefloors becomes a eulogy and a prayer, an act of mourning and a symbol of hope. Times is compact and glossy, competent and earnest. The first song opens with a muffled declaration about the power of house music: “There was harmony in the music, there was harmony in the behavior of the people, and we had a good time.” Lewis rejoices in the mundanity of nightlife with surprising tenderness and grace.His influences are blatant—the burble and glide of labelmates Disclosure, the packaged funk of the Neptunes—and sometimes homage slips into imitation. The bassline at the start of “Chemicals” is a dead ringer for Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky,” and it lingers long enough to miss the source material. Once the track unfolds, though, it reveals more: glittering snarls of synths, an intricate layer of strings in the background. “I might be seeing double, but I need you both,” Lewis croons, wrenching intimacy out of drunk desperation. “Time” builds off a Dennis Edwards sample, sliced and warped as Rhye writhes his voice over the tingling beat.Nile Rodgers stops by for a kinetic blast of guitar on “One More,” a glistening ode to party flirting and the best track on the album. Lewis distorts and layers his vocals, smearing them over cinematic synths and a twirling drum pattern. He focuses on the tiny, fleeting choices that stitch together a night: a cigarette on the balcony, a move to another bar. “I know you’ve got friends in the bathroom stall,” he sings, pleading. “Can we just stay here for one more song?”"

And yet, one bum line from Phonte still threatens to derail it with every listen-- ""Applied for the job of rap nigga/ But I was overqualified."" For better or (mostly) worse, this sort of mindset has boxed in just about everything he's done since with Little Brother, his project with rapper Big Pooh. Though obviously in pursuit of commercial adulation and positioning himself as a vanguard of thinking man's hip-hop, Phonte too often casts those who are more successful in simple and condescending terms while offering a one-step solution to all hip-hop's ills-- increased sales of Little Brother records. A slew of missed opportunities and disillusion with the game have resulted in a whole lot of disappointing Phonte projects. But knowing this can't prepare you for just how closely Leave It All Behind hews to its title, as Phonte opts out of hip-hop with a nearly full-on R&B record with exactly two rapped verses. And there's really no way of preparing for how good it actually turned out.I mean, Phonte's never shied away from doing hooks, but who knew he wanted to go all-out like this? But go straight long enough from the grid of the mainstream and you'll end up where you were-- word is that rapper-ternt-sanger is a pretty big with the kids these days. But while Leave It All Behind can certainly be judged in a different light post-808s and Heartbreak, it actually has more in common with Yo La Tengo's *And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-*Out, a similarly muted, lovely, and humane take on adult relationships worth working for (which makes it the complete opposite of the often embarrassingly juvenile petulance of 808s). Grown and maybe not-so sexy, but certainly lived-in. ""All or Nothing/Coming Home to You"" begins with the always-charming intro where its narrator arguing with a woman you can't see or hear. But when Phonte mutters, ""That's cool-- I wanted to play Xbox on the big TV anyways"" after being shuttled off to the couch, it's reminiscent of the kind of knowing detail Mike Skinner used to master in before coke and zen fucked up his brain.Phonte's voice isn't really suited for heavy lifting, but he's hardly alone on Leave It All Behind, getting contributions from Nicolay's more unheralded collaborators and making it rightfully feel like a conversation. Darien Brockington's easygoing lilt raises ""Take Off Your Blues"" out of a dangerously Love Below sentiment, while Musinah and Yahzarah give earthy counterpoint to the siesta soundscapes of ""Daykeeper"" and ""If She Breaks Your Heart."""

Portland, Oregon's A Weather, however, have managed to create an album full of songs that are both sonically expansive and painstakingly private. Their debut full-length is bursting with intricately plotted melodies and lush arrangements that sound like they were made in a bedroom, but meant for a ballroom.Sure, the news angle here is how a relatively unknown quintet from the Rose City snagged an opening slot on last year's Bright Eyes tour and a spot on Team Love's roster. But, despite their organic instrumentation and reluctance to deviate from sad, slow songs, they have little in common with their labelmates, and thus Conor Oberst's involvement is a mere parenthetical to the real story: these elaborately plush songs. Like Beach House without the gossamer reverb or Stars stripped of their most upbeat pop impulses, A Weather uses warm organs, folk-influenced guitars and the hushed interplay between the male and female vocalists to weave a tapestry of tenderly crafted chamber-pop that pays as much attention to its straightforward choruses as it does to its evocative details.Singer/drummer Sarah Winchester has an emotive yet controlled coo reminiscent of Aimee Mann's, and sexy, sad album opener ""Spiders, Snakes"" sounds like ""Save Me"" from the Magnolia soundtrack if Mann's version was fleshed out by fuller instrumentation and complemented by breathy male vocals. (Also, notably, that track references Bedhead, another band that knew that slow and somber didn't mean boring.)Those male vocals are provided by frontman Aaron Gerber, who, against his partner's Mannish tones, shapeshifts his winsome, pliant voice into disparate pop guises depending on each song's mood. For ""Pilot's Arrow"", a muted acoustic number that uses flight as a metaphor for a failing romance (and, curiously, finds Gerber singing to his drummer by name), he gets in touch with his inner whispery Elliott Smith. And on ""Hanging Towers of Baltimore"", he embodies the creamy-smooth tenor of Paul Simon, which is apt since the track softly alludes to the parts of Graceland that Vampire Weekend didn't already steal.Though the interaction between Gerber and Winchester's voices is the dramatic throughline of the album, its heart is her drumming. She plays a threadbare three-piece set, but its sparseness anchors these tracks-whether they're plumped with layers of instruments or spare and folky-in immediacy. ""Pinky Toe"", which takes the most familiar and banal hurt in the world (that of stubbing a toe) and turns it into a meditation on personal pain, builds anticipation with its raindrop-delicate percussion simmering against the withholding electric guitar line that never seems to fully fill out its melody.Assured in their quietness, A Weather don't back away from their most vulnerable moments-Gerber and Winchester inhaling in tandem or the rustle of their mouths against the microphones-and it is those tiny, aural imperfections that make this collection so sensual. But unlike the slowcore heroes who have influenced them, this fivesome isn't restrained or careful. Even if the volume on Cove is ubiquitously low and primed for headphone listening, there is a crashing power within. No wonder they named themselves for meteorology; A Weather are, quite literally, a quiet storm."

Something about that bittersweet spectacle—as both a celebration of life and a gathering of grief—has never quite left her music. But that was years ago, when Silva was still a child growing up in Bogotá, Colombia, long before she moved to Los Angeles to escape the slut-shaming she endured in high school. Now, she makes music under the alias Loyal Lobos. She’s traded funeral hymns for synth-pop arrangements. And she’s found a way to marry the tough blow of a life left behind with the freedom that starting over allows.On Everlasting, this freedom isn’t wasted. Silva refuses to fit into the sometimes narrow mold of singer-songwriters in the U.S., where a handful of women dominate a scene Silva once called, aptly, “very American and very white.” She tinkered with their sparse folk-rock on her 2018 EP The Fall before abandoning the limits of that genre for something else entirely: an ambitious, bilingual record that hops between influences, echoing the liminal state that comes with being a 26-year-old immigrant in America. Everlasting slips into this uncertain space and manages to thrive not in spite of it, but because of it.Doing so meant letting go of some of Americana’s starry-eyed trappings. Some can still be heard on the album’s first single, “Criminals,” which balances the sad nostalgia of a time before meeting your platonic half with the addictive promise of their newfound love. When Silva’s voice swarms to the heavens, singing, “I’d kill for you,” it invokes a teenaged lust to evade the world’s rules together, her fingerpicked riff scoring the getaway. But on the rest of Everlasting, it sounds like Silva’s done running away from reality. Nearly a year after the longing “Criminals” was released, she’s leaning into herself more and opting for fun as an antidote to trauma. It’s a new kind of safeguard, heard in the whimsy of the album’s percussive pop elements—a surprise that only begins to make sense upon hearing that Silva landed Shawn Mendes’ hitmaker, Teddy Geiger, as her executive producer.Traces of Silva’s upbringing in Colombia often illuminate these playful moments. Grand telenovela soundtracks, the dreamy haze of the countryside, and the machista culture that drove her away in the first place are all hinted at in experiments in shoegaze and reggaeton-reminiscent rhythms. It takes frisky songs like “Si Te Portas Mal (Be Bad)” and the Auto-Tuned “Papel” to break up the haze of Silva’s double-tracked vocals—a sonic shift that also seems to give way to more pointed language in her mother tongue. On “Si Te Portas Mal (Be Bad),” Silva reminds the guys that she’s a “perra, pero el alma baby/Entera,” or a slut whose soul is whole. This makes the lawless, cinematic slant of 2019’s “Criminals” feel schmaltzy in comparison.That isn’t to say that the simpler balladry on Everlasting is without substance. When Silva quips on the record’s title track, “The stars are now aligned/L.A. people seem to care/Never got to see them/City lights over shine outer space,” you get a sense of a place back home where people can actually see the stars instead of just imagining them.Yet this nimble songwriting is sometimes obscured—and not only purposefully, like it is by the sizzling feedback on “Whatever It Is” or the taffeta reverb of “You Were Bored.” Silva’s words have a tendency to coast loosely into each other, blurring entire sentences into one breathless slip. Hers is nothing like the crisp deadpan we get from L.A.’s Phoebe Bridgers, who Silva often gets compared to. That difference isn’t without its redeeming qualities, however. There is something powerful in this remnant of where she came from—an insular delivery in which the Spanish-language lilt of her motherland always makes itself known.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

In a recent interview with The Boot, the 25-year-old singer-songwriter described how each track represents a turning point in her life: the moment she came out as gay, the hard conversations that followed, the resulting discomfort in the suburban Georgia Christian community where she grew up, the way it all affected her relationship with her girlfriend. The music reflects these personal trajectories. Her songs are patient but determined, navigating serious subjects with quiet familiarity.Although she came up around Nashville country venues, Pruitt writes songs that feel more aligned with the last few years of indie rock. Her penchant for stately ballads with choruses to shatter glass recalls similarly introspective but explosive work by Julien Baker, while the title track pulses with the roller-rink soft rock of Jenny Lewis’ latest records. Though the label offered to pair her with bigger names, Pruitt chose to produce the album with her friend Michael Robinson, a collaborator dating back to her days playing the weddings-and-parties circuit in college. You can sense their trust in each other: Every track is given space to unfold, building into a record that feels deeply thoughtful and unified, in step with her contemporaries yet detached from any particular scene.Along with the grand arrangements, Pruitt’s lyrics, written over four years, bind the album together. At times, she seems to respond to herself with a momentum that feels almost chronological. To the listless narrator in “My Mind’s a Ship (That’s Going Down),” there’s the casual pep talk in “Expectations.” For the painful dissonance that drives her to resent herself in “Normal,” there’s the emboldened push to follow her intuition in “Loving Her.” Giving voice to characters who feel left out by society, Pruitt occasionally runs into the same clichés that tend to box them in. But as soon as she echoes that received wisdom—say, a refrain about how the truth can set you free in “Searching for the Truth”—she exerts her own skepticism: “Everybody’s full of shit, there’s no denying,” she sings in the chorus. Many of her lyrics proceed this way, comparing lessons she thinks she should have learned by now to the ones she’s actually living day-to-day.“I used to be ashamed to write a song that said her name,” Pruitt sings of a partner in her breakout single “Loving Her.” One of several songs that describes a struggle to feel comfortable around her own family and friends, it reckons the need to be heard against the lingering desire to hide. Her songwriting now makes no such concessions, and even her singing expresses a surging confidence; her voice could carry pop songs and torch ballads, but she instead pairs it with starker, slower narratives, highlighting characters whose doubt drives them as much as their convictions. It’s complicated subject matter from a young songwriter, and Expectations arrives with the great unburdening of saying how you feel after years of keeping it inside.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Hayley Kiyoko, the 26-year-old former Disney star, is one of pop’s few openly gay female artists, whose fans have taken to calling her “lesbian Jesus.” It’s tongue in cheek, but speaks to the hunger for representation among marginalized fandoms—the hoards who flocked to Kiyoko’s early music videos, which offered rare representations of relationships and flirtations between women. Kiyoko now has to balance their interests against her own budding pop star identity, plus the demands of the mainstream that she (and label Empire/Atlantic) evidently want her to break into: Expectations seems like a particularly loaded title.For her part, Kiyoko seems ambitious. The album comes with a kind of conceptual architecture: opening with the “Expectations (Overture),” and containing a pair of two-part song suites, plus an interlude called “xx.” The sound of the sea and distant birds sometimes color the edges of the songs, giving a rough sense of a contained world, but not much more than that. It doesn’t seem like a leap of faith to guess that the elegant storytelling of Melodrama was an inspiration here, though Expectations doesn’t really use its structure for neat narrative or stylistic tricks in the way that Lorde did.For one thing, it lacks that kind of songwriting consistency. The obsessive “Wanna Be Missed” has the breathy luster of a forgotten cut off the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack, although Kiyoko’s ecstatic crescendo lands with a thud on the blankly intoned line, “I’ve never felt nothing like that,” as if waking up from dental anesthesia. “Let It Be,” the song that closes the album, and puts a lid on the tempestuous relationship that courses throughout, is as stompy of feet and jingly of bell as the Lumineers. “Palm Dreams,” a cheap postcard to Los Angeles life, sounds oddly dated and features a refrain (“Party with us”) that sounds swept from Justin Timberlake’s cutting-room floor. It’s the only song here featuring anything close to a blue-chip songwriter, in “Boom Clap” co-writer Fredrik Berger, which may indict the resources and priority levels afforded to this album.Those are the most disparate parts of a truly enjoyable if rarely remarkable record, one that lacks the budget of high-end pop but aspires to its trappings. Kiyoko isn’t yet a particularly distinctive vocalist, but “confrontational” is a mode that really suits her. Single “Curious” has a similarly choreographed shuffle in its chorus to Dua Lipa’s “New Rules,” and contains a few pin-sharp barbs worthy of Lorde: “Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?” Kiyoko taunts at a girl who’s dropped her for a dude. “Forget to bring your jacket/Wrap up in him ‘cause you wanted to?” Plus it has a perfectly turned kiss-off: “I’m just curious,” she sings, with icy mocking: “Is it serious?” (That and a textbook pop pause pre-chorus: one of those brilliant, tiny spaces that feels like taking a breath before a giant leap.)Similarly barbed is “He’ll Never Love You (HNLY)” which balances Kiyoko’s well-worn weariness with the rigmarole of being a straight girl’s experiment with deservedly bratty, indignant delivery. This is Expectations at its best: Kiyoko trading in specificity rather than generic neediness, representing an experience that rarely finds an outlet in pop (see also: Years & Years’ brilliant “Sanctify”). The writing on “What I Need” might not be of the same standard, but duetting with Kehlani on a certified Bisexual Bop is inspired, and has legs as a genuine hit if the label is prepared to attempt to push a queer love song into the mainstream. Given that Halsey and Lauren Jauregui’s comparable “Strangers” scraped the Billboard 100 at… 100, I wouldn’t hold your breath. Kiyoko’s debut won’t blow past anyone’s expectations, but it contains just enough intrigue and individuality to sustain them for a second shot."

More often than not, it ends up sounding like a Broadway tribute.","In Daisy Jones & the Six, the bestselling novel inspired by Fleetwood Mac’s tumultuous history, Taylor Jenkins Reid writes an album’s worth of song lyrics to hint at her fictional band’s pathos. In the climactic “Regret Me,” frontwoman Daisy Jones delivers a devastating burn to her co-lead and songwriting partner, Billy Dunne: “When you think of me, I hope it ruins rock’n’roll.” It’s a terrible line, but in the book it’s met with shock and awe. Reid’s lyrics are packed with zingers capturing the vocalists’ romantic tension, a strain that ultimately spells the Six’s undoing.“Regret Me” gets the full studio treatment in the Amazon Original series, an adaptation of Reid’s book. While the TV version of that song is outfitted with new lyrics, the barbs are similarly clunky: “Go ahead and regret me/But I’m beating you to it, dude.” Still, the soundtrack album accompanying the series, Aurora, is a can’t-lose proposition for producer Blake Mills. With crack session players and a fathomless budget behind him, he gets to chase his own Laurel Canyon masterpiece; the fictional conceit provides cover when he falls short. Contributors on this record include Marcus Mumford, Madison Cunningham, and Roger Joseph Manning Jr. The fact that they got the Jackson Browne to write music for the adaptation of a supermarket novel says more about the record biz than Amazon’s mockumentary possibly could.At its most ambitious, Aurora approximates the incremental trajectories of Fleetwood Mac’s late-’70s work. “Let Me Down Easy” and “Regret Me” careen through striking melodic pivots, anchored by warm Rhodes keys and the vocal harmonies of actors Sam Claflin and Riley Keough, who play Jones and Dunne in the series. On “Look at Us Now (Honeycomb),” the acoustic chords and kick drum gather momentum en route to a soaring single-chord guitar solo. It’s a clear nod to Rumours’ “The Chain,” but the degree of intricacy—not to mention the bravura guitar work—makes for a rewarding homage.Mills knows that trying to replicate Fleetwood Mac’s opus is a fool’s errand, so he hedges his bets. The title track is more redolent of the Nashville machine than Laurel Canyon, and the vocal duets betray a Broadway sheen. On “Look at Us Now,” Claflin’s exaggerated vibrato fails to compensate for underwritten lyrics: “I don’t know who I am, baby, baby, baby/Do you know who you are? Is it out of our hands?” There’s no symbolism or mystique, no white-winged doves or Rhiannons—it’s hard to imagine any of these adult-contemporary show tunes cracking the FM rotation, let alone in 1977."

Yes, it's yet another side project release from the folks that brought you Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Set Fire to Flames and the Silver Mt. Zion Hoonja-Doonja Ice Cream Symposium. The fact that there's a Motherfucker (as in Jackie-O) along for the ride doesn't change the overriding MO of the primary players. Aurora is gorgeous, cinematic stuff, dominated by cello and eccentric percussive instruments like clevises and rototom shells. And, unsurprisingly, the packaging is equally gorgeous-- an embossed gatefold CD sleeve complete with black disc envelope and postcard, as well as slightly skewed typeface setting.Folks not yet inured to this collective's bombast and grandeur might be surprised by how gentle and serene these tracks are. ""Histories Repeating..."" lists in a foggy meditative fashion for nearly 17 minutes, while the comparatively pop-length ""Why She Swallows..."" twinkles and trembles. When there's a threat of the folks rocking out in a hamfisted fashion (as on the very first track, ""Quelques Mots Pleins D'ombre""), Esmerine opts to err on the demure side of aggression. Folks unfamiliar with all things godsped, but with a predilection for groups like Rachels and the Dirty Three, might also want to give this a try.For those that got over the gorgeous instrumentation and the importance of each telegraphed loud-soft shift and the interminable song titles sometime after Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada, this disc will seem relentlessly polite and tasteful. More importantly, Aurora won't sound much different than anything this group-- together or apart-- has already produced. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that, for all intents and purposes, it's the same thing."

Alongside reissues, Unseen Worlds has also offered up an adventurous exploration of contemporary piano music. Releases run the gamut from stately solo piano pieces by Ethiopian classical composer Girma Yifrashewa to achingly slow takes on Erik Satie by founding Fluxus member Philip Corner to a stunning modern ambient album from jungle/breakcore pioneer Robert Haigh.This year the label adds two new entries to that list, first Hague-based Leo Svirsky’s River Without Banks and now Michael Vincent Waller’s third album, Moments. Waller’s 2015 double-disc debut The South Shore found the New York-based composer presenting a diverse array of works written over a five-year period, with some 20 total players performing pieces for solo cello, string quartet, flute, and a saxophone and electric guitar ensemble. On 2017’s Trajectories, Waller narrowed his focus to the interplay between cello and piano. Moments zooms in even further; five of the 18 compositions presented here are for vibraphone, the remainder for solo piano. R. Andrew Lee, pianist on Trajectories and a noted interpreter for minimal composers like Dennis Johnson and Jürg Frey, is again seated at the bench. Waller enlists William Winant—percussionist to the likes of John Zorn, Frank Zappa, and Roscoe Mitchell—on vibraphone. Both men are renowned for their restraint, and they are a perfect fit for Waller’s sensibilities. Every note and gesture on Moments seems to be deeply felt and philosophically weighed before a hand touches a piano key or lifts a mallet.Waller is uninterested in hiding behind any sort of artifice in his compositions, conveying sentiment as directly through the notation as possible. There’s little reverb to the recording, no electronic processing or layering; the sustaining pedal isn’t depressed for the duration of the album. He’s uninterested in a larger canvas when a postcard will suffice. None of the compositions last longer than six minutes, and many speak their piece well before the three-minute mark. Waller seems as attuned to the notes struck as to the overtones produced and their natural decay, which perhaps comes from his studies with minimalist composers like La Monte Young and Bunita Marcus, the latter perhaps best known for the piece that composer Morton Feldman named for her."

The New York genre, while it seemed to wither 40 years ago, is a key ingredient in his gloriously messy alchemy, which mixes flippant interpretation, heavy feedback, and agit-prop vocals with lofty traditions. The guitarist and composer has layered his scrappy voice over improvisatory jazz, crafted collections of celebratory Cuban montuno (on one track, Ribot sings in Spanish with a self-consciously bad accent), and recorded a volume of compositions by his mentor, Haitian classical guitarist Frantz Casseus. He’s been most consistent as leader of Ceramic Dog, a power trio of jazz geniuses who inflect literate rock with formidable chops. The synthesis is frenetic, potent, and at odds with the zeitgeist, even if Ribot’s lyrics decry today’s political oppression: Musically, he rejects both the voguish and the virtuosic in favor of his own whims.The band hitches Ribot with bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Ches Smith, musicians known for artfully changing horses midstream. Famously omnivorous, Ismaily is fresh off Love in Exile, a trio collaboration whose gorgeous, glacial changes are the polar opposite of Ceramic Dog. Smith, once the drummer for indie mainstays Xiu Xiu, has carved out a parallel practice as a composer and percussionist whose outsider immersion in Haitian music rivals Ribot’s. Mercurial tendencies can divide groups; they’ve kept Ceramic Dog together for 18 years, guiding the band as it skirts trendiness in favor of conviction. The three-piece offers a playfully naive idea of how rock might be in a world more invested in social justice than commerce: rambling and trenchant, like the dinnertime rant of a pissed-off family member.Connection, Ceramic Dog’s fifth LP, stretches these abundant qualities into a rollicking, leisurely hour. Ribot and co. roll through rock, free jazz, boogaloo, son cubano, and, on their thrilling cover of “That’s Entertainment,” the popular songbook as filtered through post-punk. Along the way, they bludgeon us with the most direct rock song of their career, the title track and opener, which sacrifices charming bookishness for bruising force. Later, they proffer soul-stirring free jazz on “Swan,” abandoning the irony Ribot once honed as a member of the Lounge Lizards in favor of unambiguous beauty. Aided by James Brandon Lewis’ saxophone, the track is a gem at the record’s center, its prismatic light brightening the rest of Connection’s longform improvisations.Ceramic Dog’s undersung last album, Hope, was a marvel of structure: Split along a line of symmetry, it separated Ribot’s talky concoctions from the band’s jams, a duality that felt almost spiritual. Connection dispenses with its predecessor’s deliberate formatting and, relatedly, a sense of tension. Ribot’s stylistic fascinations each get a moment in the sun: Hard-rockin’ singles adjoin conga rhythms, which bump shoulders with the political screed of “Soldiers in the Army of Love” and the dadaist babble of “Heart Attack.” Ribot previously complicated his leftist declamations with caustic zigzags, flitting between lucid indignation and cracked reasoning. “Muslim Jewish Resistance,” from 2018’s YRU Still Here, is a surprising, martial plea for the two faiths to unite against bigotry. “Hippies Are Not Nice Anymore,” from 2020’s Bandcamp-only EP What I Did on My ‘Long’ Vacation, hilariously logs the crowded road linking Woodstock idealism and cynical Silicon Valley riches."

That band-- formed by bored, obsessive teenagers in mid-1980s Birmingham, England-- sped up death metal into a chaotic, borderline comical blur; their best-known early song is probably still the one-second John Peel favorite ""You Suffer"". The frenzied style that these kids pioneered came to be known as grindcore, and their debut album, Scum, is now regarded as a stone classic in underground metal. But all the original members drifted away; the band remains a touring machine staffed by grizzled vets who regularly crank out more albums of still-potent bloodlettings. You have to wonder how it feels to be a grown man, making your living playing in a band that was started by children, children who no longer have any real connection to what you're doing. And you have to wonder how it feels to be one of those children, moving on to other things in life and watching your childhood creation continuing to pound away.One of those children is Justin Broadrick, whose post-Napalm Death body of work is a varied and fascinating thing. With Godflesh, he built a brutal slow-thud form of electronic rock, a sound so heavy you couldn't rightly call it metal. He's also made various forms of scraping noise under different names: Techno Animal, Final, Pale Sketcher. And for nearly a decade, he's been the man behind Jesu, where he's done something more startling than anything he did under his other guises: He's created beauty. Jesu's music is a kind of tidal slow-churn take on sad-bastard indie rock, Broadrick burying his muttery one-note vocals under avalanches of guitar fuzz and slathering them in prettily reverbed synth figures.Jesu have released most of their music on Hydra Head, a label that specializes in contemplative metal, but lately they've been recording for Calo Verde, the label founded by the Red House Painters' Mark Kozelek. Broadrick has cited the Red House Painters as an inspiration, and it's easy to see how those two could form a mutual admiration society. Jesu, especially on the new Ascension, do a pretty incredible job evoking the feeling of depression through music, its melodies buried under so many oceans of impossibly slow sound that you just barely notice they're there. Nothing Broadrick has ever done with Jesu would give you any clue he was ever in Napalm Death, but on his last two albums, a punishing riff or a gnarled roar would occasionally flare up out of nowhere. And there was also a punk-rock directness about the music; more than one critic compared Jesu to Jawbreaker. But on Ascension, Broadrick never allows himself a moment of catharsis or hope; it's music for rocking back and forth in a fetal position."

Rarely has percussive innovation sounded this downright satisfying.","Making your way through the formidable back catalog of long-time Fela Kuti drummer Tony Allen—one that spans nearly half a century—is a revelatory, sometimes head-spinning journey. Allen’s work has traversed styles that on the surface have little in common beyond his unique rhythmic presence. In the past 10 years, for example, Allen has tackled everything from Afrobeat (on solo album Film of Life), dreamy French pop (with Charlotte Gainsbourg), downbeat indie rock (with The Good, the Bad & the Queen), and techno (with the Moritz Von Oswald Trio). This range is a testament to both Allen’s redoubtable drumming skills and his ability to rein in his percussive ego in support of the job at hand.Curiously, though, for a drummer who absorbed so much of his percussive knowledge from the work of Max Roach and Art Blakey, there was little place in Allen’s catalog for actual jazz until 2017. In May of this year, he released a tribute to Blakey and his Jazz Messengers on legendary jazz label Blue Note. That EP, which saw Allen filter Blakey’s hard swing through his own Afrobeat elasticity, serves as a brilliant precursor to The Source, with which it shares label, musicians, and influences. More importantly, The Source shares a fascinating musical hybridity with the Blakey EP. It’s a continuation of the cultural back-and-forth between African music and jazz that, decades ago, saw Blakey absorb West African musical influences on albums such as 1962’s The African Beat, and Allen mold the influence of jazz into the Afrobeat sound.But The Source isn’t a jazz album, per se: Allen’s drums don’t typically swing so much as jitter and jiggle, with boundless syncopated rhythms that sound like a giant squid menacing a drum kit. Nor is it an Afrobeat album, with Allen’s band comprised largely of Parisian jazz musicians plus Cameroonian guitarist Indy Dibongue; Damon Albarn makes a low-key contribution to “Cool Cats.” Rather, this is an album that straddles jazz and Afrobeat in an elegant push-and-pull that sometimes edges closer to the former, sometimes wanders closer to the latter, and often sits joyfully in the middle.On “Wolf Eats Wolf,” for example, a scratchy Afrobeat groove—all sputtering, percussive organ and ecstatic brass riffs—gives way to a wandering trombone solo. Album opener “Moody Boy” goes in the other direction: a scattered, jazzy introduction that sounds semi-improvised, dissolving into chicken-scratch guitar rhythm and tough funk drums. The hybrid tone of the band is hugely important to this mix, with the Afrobeat licks of Dibongue’s choppy guitar style balanced by the more classically jazz texture of Mathias Allamane’s double bass."

Well, he did. Composer Ted Hearne's productions have tackled George W. Bush and Katrina and now the tale of Manning and what led to her 25-year prison sentence. A complex, beautiful piece of theater, Hearne has pushed to make The Source succeed as a piece of music.","More than a few of the vicious old debates in ""new classical"" music have been settled. In 2015, a composer isn’t obliged to choose melodic minimalism over atonal complexity, or vice versa. If she wants to write something that ""addresses the times,"" there’s no set aesthetic to follow. Execution is what the community of listeners has (generally) pledged to judge.You can hear this relatively new, pan-stylistic freedom quite clearly in the music of Ted Hearne. As a political animal, he’s a liberal populist; as a composer, he’s a fan of preexisting texts and musical maximalism. His 2010 protest song-cycle Katrina Ballads set real life excerpts from an American tragedy—think of George W. Bush’s famous assessment ""Brownie you’re doing a heck of a job""—to a richly textured musical backdrop that blended jazz and classical vocal approaches with aggrieved electric guitar and frenetic chamber scoring. In 2013, Hearne provided Erykah Badu with well-judged orchestrations of songs from New Amerykah: Part One (4th World War), which Badu performed live with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. (We’re still waiting for a proper studio recording of those.)With this album, Hearne gives us a distillation of an experimental stage work about Chelsea Manning (and WikiLeaks) that was presented in 2014 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Composing once again atop found texts—including logs of Manning’s chats and leaked government documents that were selected and edited by the novelist Mark Doten—Hearne’s latest project gives us some of the composer’s most intriguing music yet.In the song ""s/as boy/as a boy"", Hearne scores one of Manning’s haunting pre-arrest concerns—""i wouldn’t mind going to prison for the rest of my life/ if it wasn’t for the possibility of having pictures of me.../ plastered all over the world press.../ as boy""—by way of a somber cello-and-guitar riff that is frequently interrupted by percussive slaps. (The discrete instrumental parts swirl together with an affecting unease, circa Manning’s line, ""I'm just kind of drifting now."")Another highlight is ""Julian in a Nutshell"", in which Doten creates lyrics from shards of questions delivered to Julian Assange by reporters. At first, Hearne pairs Doten’s documentary cut-up fragments with airy individual string and vocal lines. As the journalistic narrative is better established—demanding that Assange define himself as either a ""journalist"", an ""anarchist"", or the victim of a ""smear campaign""—the vocal lines settle into sunnier harmonies. It’s the sound of the press finding an angle, though Hearne’s subtly clattering orchestration isn’t as sold on the quality of the conversation."

The American-born, Berlin-based musician has consistently deflected interpretations of her music’s meaning, eluding attempts to classify her by genre, gender, or otherwise. While her club-focused EPs have been influenced by various foundational elements of Detroit techno, those same elements—jazz, funk, a certain sci-fi sensibility—have fused in entirely unexpected ways on her full-lengths.On her Hyperdub debut, Quarantine, her untreated vocals and intimate lyrics told a story which, though perhaps not entirely literal, seemed deeply personal. Yet on Chance of Rain, its 2013 follow-up, she abandoned vocals in favour of flickering, jazzy keys and iridescent synth baths—perhaps an escape route from being bracketed by gender. “People tend to heavily focus on female artists’ voices and define their work by it,” she argued in an interview with Truants last year, noting that her instrumental work had been interpreted as having “an ‘absence of authentic human presence’.”On the ferociously ambitious Dust, an album that feels like it was constructed in zero-gravity conditions, Halo has reached a kind of synthesis of all that came before. If, as she reminds us, her instrumental music is no less “authentically human” than her vocal music, then Dust sets out to show that the human voice is not much guarantee of authentic humanity either.The album opens with Halo’s voice on “Sun to Solar.” Over slippery rhythms and topsy-turvy keys (provided throughout by Shit and Shine’s Craig Clouse) she half-sings an adaptation of “Servidão de Passagem,” a 1962 work by Brazilian concrete poet Haroldo de Campos: “Stacked man, sacked man/Served and swallowed/Sun to salt, island man/Socko sick, who's hangman.” Halo processes her words beyond recognition, blurring them with the hyper-melismatic vocals of British singer and collage-pop artist Klein, one of the many guests on Dust. It’s a disorienting starting point on an album that revels in indeterminacy.The album’s graspable melodic moments come between longer expanses of confusing and chaotic sound; on “Nicht Ohne Risiko” and “Like an L,” instruments arrange themselves in abstract patterns, orbiting loosely like weightless space debris. “Arschkriecher” drifts toward mysticism as dissonant gong strikes are drowned in dub effects and ribbons of tenor saxophone float by. On “Koinos,” the gravitational pull is barely strong enough to hold the song together; a flurry of found sound is warped by transmission errors and Halo’s voice fades into a crackle, lost beneath percussion and glockenspiel from composer Eli Keszler, who contributes throughout the album."

Fans sniff out gems, report on hot streaks, predict hot streaks. Just like anything based on speculating, things can change quickly; there are market forces at work. More so than most of her peers, Ellen Allien is in control of her own stock. She's a career artist-- in addition to her music, she runs Bpitch Control and a fashion label-- and her moves are large and purposeful. This has occasionally led to releases that felt calculated-- 2008's Sool was her ""minimal"" album-- but in sum have made Allien worth tracking through a career, not just through a particularly creative stretch. Dust, Allien's latest album, again redefines her, this time as a melancholy techno-pop songwriter with interests well outside her Berlin techno sphere.Dust mines similar territory as Allien's still seminal Berlinette, lacking that album's sturdy radiance but offering plenty of veteran risk-taking. There's steely electro, lilting synth-pop, and a calm salsa. One song sounds like the xx, another like Goldfrapp. During ""Sun the Rain"", the xx soundalike, Allien sings, ""Some days life feels so easy,"" which is perfect: Allien's statuses as scene leader and lifetime artist seem assured, and Dust sounds like a fun, comfortable reflection of that.An inveterate collaborator, Allien worked with German producer Tobias Freund on Dust. A shapeshifter himself, Freund helps Allien navigate the album's veering styles. Allien is a rich sound designer, embedding earworms into deceptively simple productions. ""You"" is a straightforward bass-and-guitars affair until its bridge opens up, briefly, to teardrop synths. ""Should We Go Home"", the album's longest and loosest track, emerges from a long beatless passage with a burrowing two-note patch. Allien gets into trouble only when she slips into old habits. She overplays her hand a bit on ""Flashy Flashy"", repeating, mantra-like, ""Flashy flashy flashy flashy disco lights"" in a husky whisper. We get it: dance music can be facile and image-conscious and still fun. Her insistence on adding her treated voice to nearly every track kills the momentum of those that don't need it.Allien's earned the right to experiment, but more importantly, she's earned patience. If you can't cotton to ""Huibuh""'s gentle playfulness or ""Sun the Rain""'s guitar pop, you might be missing the point of an artist like Allien. Dust isn't necessarily brave-- Allien has approached territory like this before-- but it's definitely a departure, with just one track, ""Ever"", offering clubby beatmaking. Techno fans already love Allien's old work. Dust offers new challenges: to enjoy her stumbles, to trust her instincts."

Whatever memo found its way into Cypress Hill DJ Muggs' drug drawer must surely deserve the blame for Dust, a technically competent but lacking attempt to expand the producer's repertoire beyond the dusty, wet-smoking rhythmic foundations he laid down on early Cypress albums, using the nu-metal crossover of their 2000 disc, Skull and Bones, as the point of disembarking. You won't hear anything that draws from the gloomy barrio beats of Temples of Doom or Black Sunday, and the dearth of MCs guarantees no lyrical meditations to rival ""How Could I Just Kill a Man""; even ""Dr. Greenthumb"" rises above.With the exception of Everlast, who contributes his Kentucky moonshiner exhalations to the boring, heart-broken sob-story ""Gone for Good"", the majority of the vocal contributions here are made by female singers, chanteuses who at all times strain to approximate the performances of trip-hop notables like Beth Gibbons, Björk, Tracey Thorn, and anyone else who sounds impressively sultry, strung out and seductive. That seems to be the order of the day for Muggs; the cranky wall-of-noise ""Dead Flowers"", the blatant ""Angel"" ripoff ""I Know"", and ""Tears"" are as contrived and forgettable as their titles suggest, and equally interchangeable.Juxtapose, Muggs' loose collaboration with Tricky, seems to have rubbed off and drifted to the surface, but Muggs can't quite pin it down. So instead, it flies all over the room, shitting everywhere and squawking rabidly, and we're left with some weak Britpop hybrids (with the embarrassingly saccharine ""Rain"" at the top of the list) and some token snippets of studio tomfoolery, ranging from the almost-clever Laswell IDM of ""Shadows"" to the, um, almost-clever ambient music of ""Niente"". I pity the fool who has to clean this up. It's an unrefined, poorly calculated mess.I know everything reads to the contrary, but I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. Really. You can't fuck with the aforementioned Cypress records; shit, even the Muggs-produced ""Babalu Bad Boy"" rocked the house harder than anything on Dust ten years prior. Would it help to know that on the CD I'm looking at, it boasts:""A down-tempo rock masterpiece by Cypress Hill's legendary producer""?No, I'm not doubting DJ Muggs. I'm doubting the quality of a song like ""Morta"", with its jack-in-the-box flamenco bombast struggling to impersonate Björk's ""I Play Dead"", which isn't that good to begin with anyway. I'm questioning any excuse you can think of for the trite, nasally ""Faded"": ""We are, we are, we are, we are always faded/ You are, you are, you are the one in my pages...""? What is the excuse for that bullshit? Get this out of my house."

He's not the only top-drawer jazzbo making serious use of electronica; more and more bands are mixing the acoustic with the electric and the improvised with the processed, from labelmates Spring Heel Jack to the glitched-up fusion of Norway's Jaga Jazzist. Shipp may not be the first or most adventurous, but he made a tasteful, logical album that still boasted fat bass and catchy riffs.His latest disc, Equilibrium, also uses the synth work and production of FLAM (Chris Flam). But instead of pushing the electronics and making a funkier, nastier successor to his hit, this new disc feels like nothing so much as the Modern Jazz Quartet. FLAM's additions are more subtle, and instead of a horn player, the rotating sideman this time is Khan Jamal, whose stately, ringing vibraphone perfectly complements Shipp's pensive lines.Shipp has explained that this is the ""synthesis"" of the directions he's been taking lately; free-floating, hot, straight, electrified: It's a chance to double back and get everything right. For Shipp, that means this may be his most carefully perfected album, which in this guy's case is not a dismissal. While Shipp can sprawl vivaciously next to the right partner-- like fire-breathing tenor giant David S. Ware-- his own work often veers towards the cerebral and angular. His tunes sound like they're composed on graph paper, and although the titles have a sci-fi vibe, they don't conjure up the Funkadelic Mothership as much as 1950s Arthur C. Clarke: names like ""Nebula Theory"", ""Cohesion"" and ""World of Blue Glass"" imply scientists floating past abandoned spaceships and gigantic blocks of ice.The cool veneer can distract from the variety on this disc. The nine compositions each take a different mood and strategy, as the band jumps from the ballad ""World of Blue Glass"" to Jamal's fiery showcase ""Vamp to Vibe"", then to the beats and distorted horn samples that funk up ""The Root"". Yet they're as concise and blocked off as tanks at an aquarium: Each one makes its point in around five minutes, and none lasts a second too long.Shipp brings along the same rhythm section as his last few dates, with bassist William Parker and Gerald Cleaver on drums. Much has been written about Parker, one of Shipp's longest-running and most compatible partners, but it's Cleaver who intrigues me more than ever before when he matches FLAM's beats with a mechanical crispness, or plays a subtle but erratic rhythm under the otherwise tranquil title track. Jamal is the newest performer to this group, and the most welcome surprise: A sorely under-recorded talent who has played since the 60s, he has worked with Billy Bang, Sunny Murray and the Ronald Shannon Jackson Decoding Society. On this date, he's an impeccable soloist-- for example, the straight-but-shimmering blues of ""The Key""-- and also a stellar improviser, whose vibes help color the abstract sections."

The quartet refrain from histrionic, death-worshipping self-hatred and instead embrace a more cosmic, organic take on sorrow.","There's an immense sense of satisfaction that comes with watching a band progress. It’s exhilarating to see talented, hardworking people take those first steps out of the practice room and into the world armed with only a handful of riffs and ambition. Sometimes it takes awhile, and sometimes the rewards come fast. The excellent Oakland death doom quartet Lycus have taken the latter path. Their first release, 2011’s Demo MMXI, made the rounds quietly, catching underground attention with three gutted paeans simmering beneath a stark, skeletal Bryan Proteau cover. It felt raw and honest, and captured the imagination in a way that’s rarely seen from metal’s extreme outliers. On Tempest, their first proper album, and first for 20 Buck Spin, the rough edges have been sanded down, and the light shines through.Often used interchangeably with ""death doom,"" funeral doom is more accessible than the most perverse, impenetrable corners of black metal, death, and grind, but don’t be fooled-- the punishing lengths, torturously slow tempos, and disquieting emotional heft it offers still inflict plenty of damage. Those who enter into the darkest depths of this suicidal subsect are asked to abandon all hope, and given little choice in the matter. Lycus approach the void carefully. Though they’ve had the funeral doom tag lobbed at them already, it’s not entirely accurate: 11 minute songs do not a funeral doom band make, and Lycus show no interest in following genre conventions. They refrain from histrionic, death-worshipping self-hatred and instead embrace a more cosmic, organic take on sorrow. Given their Bay Area lineage, it’s not hard to connect the dots and see that their proximity to like-minded acts Asunder, Graves At Sea, and Noothgrush has made an impact.Their approach eschews the classic European emphasis on keyboards and overly flowery gothic influence, focusing instead on the sludgier, more straightforward sound that American bands often gravitate towards. Think Samothrace, not Skepticism. Opening dirge “Coma Burn” sets the tone down low, with rumbling vocals and ominous chords. Their penchant for tremolo (as heard on the effortlessly, engagingly dynamic “Engravings”) speaks of a faint black metal influence, one that intensifies into mania during the epic closing track.  After the listener is taken through peaks and valleys of howling black metal, slavering sludge, and contemplative doom, “Tempest” lets us down gently, fading out in a gentle blur of noise. Punctuated by mournful violins, each of the album’s three compositions flows beautifully into the next, allowing for a force of movement seldom seen within the style. Melancholia reigns, yet there is no gnashing of teeth or soot-smeared wails permeating the monolithic riffs. They are better than that. Lycus have entered the next stage of mourning with this release, and their early stages of grief have matured into dignified resignation and graceful acceptance."

But they definitely felt like the work of one specific unit.

It wasn't exactly that if you heard one Tussle record you'd heard them all. But when those rhythms went slack, it could sometimes feel that way, considering the minor cosmetic mutations the band's sometimes arid, always instrumental, and all-beats-all-the-time attack had undergone since 2004's Kling Klang. It's hard to sell such stern and unchanging stuff to anyone but drum obsessives after an EP or two. Usually melody-free and sometime abstracted to the point of losing the funk entirely, it's easy to tune out when instrumental avant-dance records feel by-the-numbers rather than driven by some itchy compulsion that translated to the feel of the beats themselves.The interesting twist on Tempest is that Tussle have seriously sweetened their sound. They may open with two forbidding slabs of digital dub-- the warm bass and corroded sonics suggesting a Jamaican studio outfitted with a souped-up Atari-- but for the most part this is the most luscious music Tussle have ever put their name to. The sound is always hazy or crisp just when it needs to be.

But it also manages to arrange that potential chaos into something resembling a song, with peaks and valleys, thrills and lulls, mood shifts and memorable moments. In other words it courts an audience beyond people obsessed with snare patterns, and it's the album's obvious highlight. But even the second-tier tracks try a little harder than usual. When they look back to their old off-kilter live drumming on ""Lightly Salted"", Tussle seemingly discover how expansive that egghead funk can feel if you suddenly add some sweet and sour texture, and a little cinematic style. ""Yellow Lighter"" even uses the human voice, a little snatch of deep house longing, though again you'd be fibbing if you tried to claim a snippet-sized sample as anything approaching a ""song."""

She grew up in Napanee, Ontario, a small town best known for its proximity to the country’s largest highway and its selection of fine truck stops. She sang Pentecostal hymns in her family’s church and performed in local productions of Godspell and You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. It was little more than an average, provincial life.When the nearest big-city country station held a singing contest, a 14-year-old Lavigne sent in a tape for a chance to sing with none other than Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop superstar. Lavigne didn’t just acquit herself: She won the damn thing, which meant driving two-plus hours to the nation’s capital and belting Twain’s brassy 1993 hit “What Made You Say That” in front of a packed Ottawa hockey arena. At the time, Lavigne told Twain she wanted to be “a famous singer.”Lavigne had no idea how quickly her dream would come true: Within a few years, she’d be sneering on the cover of Rolling Stone in a black tank top and a curt plaid skirt, winkingly labeled “the Britney slayer.” The onetime country-pop princess who performed hits by Faith Hill and Sarah McLachlan at an early record label audition had become a gleeful anarchist, a pop-punk supernova who skated through videos for hits like “Complicated” and “Sk8er Boi,” causing chaos in ratty T-shirts and neckties. She wasn’t disingenuous or calculating; she was a teenager, one whose formative experiences and changes in taste were taking place while she navigated the expectations that come with a major-label record deal. The reaction between Lavigne’s volatile energy and the music industry’s commercial imperative produced her 2002 debut Let Go, a rebuttal of Spears-Aguilerian pop—overtly sexual, vaguely urban, hyper-processed—churned out by the exact same kind of hit factory. It boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.While Lavigne’s ascent from local radio contests to the top of the charts seems rapid in retrospect, her career took shape in fits and starts. Nine months after she appeared on stage with Twain, Cliff Fabri—the manager who shepherded her through the earliest phase of her career—watched her sing country karaoke in a Kingston, Ontario Chapters, the Canadian equivalent of being discovered in a college town’s Barnes & Noble. “I was thinking of her as another Sheryl Crow. They both had the same small-town roots,” Fabri told The New York Times in 2002. “Then I was thinking Fiona Apple, because of her independence. She definitely had attitude. So my line was Sheryl Crow meets Fiona Apple.”"

Just takes you right back, like any good one-hit wonder should. And remember how, after the Kennedy raves and MTV Beach House success of that song, Nada Surf did the graceful thing by fading quietly into obscurity and K-Tel royalties? That was really cool of them. Uh... they did fade quietly into obscurity, right?Hells no! Like the equally mystifying continued existence of their pan-flash peers Superdrag (sigh, WhosuckedouttheFEEEELAAAAAANNNNN!!), Nada Surf insists upon fading away rather than burning out. So now, they're dropping down to the minor leagues and trying to ignore showgoers' wiseass heckles as they tour America's low-overhead venues. If you're anything like me, there's a little voice inside of you saying, ""Dude, weird, they're still around? Shouldn't they be headlining the John Deere Alternative Rock Stage at the State Fair by now? Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so long outlived their original fifteen minutes?""Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little voice, who never did you no good anyhow. Let Go's only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds. Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny.Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say  the DB's and  The Replacements-- that'll suffice. All well and good, but the band also carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays.Said crimes include:Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"".Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the protagonist listening to Blonde on Blonde in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"".Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?).Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats.But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous ""Treading Water"". Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on Let Go, are gleefully shined into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to ruining albums by both Pavement and Phish.Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps. I'll admit, though: If forced to defend one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought. No, I'm afraid Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with Let Go, and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired."

Londoner Moiré is another kindred spirit on the label, and this release finds the producer moving toward more distinctive sound.","Like Flying Lotus and his Brainfeeder imprint or Oneohtrix Point Never with Software, Actress' Werkdiscs label owes much of its aesthetic to its owner's permeating influence. Plenty of producers try to imitate the desaturated avant-techno of Hazyville or Splazsh's dadaist dancefloor, but you can hear Actress in Werkdiscs mostly because the essence of Darren Cunningham's sound is pure lightning in a bottle—it's a creative path designed to take you to the places he uncovers. One kindred spirit to land on Werkdiscs is Moiré, an essentially anonymous Londoner.The actual similarities Moiré shares with Actress are surface level, though. When the producer debuted in early 2013 with his Never Sleep EP, autonomic, skeletal tracks like ""Lose It"" used the same gassy basslines and mindless propulsion of Splazsh's ""Lost""; by the time Moiré's Rolx EP arrived three months later, he'd already began to inch towards a more discernible identity. And those changes—no matter how rudimentary or superficial—have served him well. Because once you strip away his tunes' decaying proto-futurisms, the mechanics underneath reveal a producer working to restore function to Actress' decidedly dysfunctional strain of club music.Shelter, Moiré's first full-length, arrives 18 months into his career, and it couldn't be more timely. The record's eight productions are lean and effective in ways that most music currently inhabiting this scene can't or won't aspire to. Where Brooklyn's White Material Records pushes dirty hardware house and Jimmy Edgar's Ultramajic label treats Detroit techno like a sex toy, Shelter boils its run-in-the-red low end and hissing hi-hats until you can see yourself in their vacuum-sealed sheen. Chunky tech-house cuts like ""Dali House"" sound cold and antiseptic, but there's a slyly lascivious nature to the way Moiré buffs over his quicksilver synths with a gummy bassline. Bones' vocal turn—a deep, drawling tone not unlike of-the-moment house producer Galcher Lustwerk—only adds to the music's dark sexuality, sounding like unrequited come ons reflected off sheet metal. Shelter's penultimate tune, ""Rings (feat. Charlie Tappin)"", treads similar territory, though its clinical milieu is more content to sit back and entice you with throbbing energy and ghostly wiles.The remaining instrumental productions go further towards establishing Moiré's own place in the techno landscape. These tracks oscillate between affecting the styles of Ostgut Ton-with-charisma (""Attitude"" and ""No Gravity"") and Omar-S-imitating-M.C. Escher (""Infinity Shadow"" and ""Stars""), and always with a generously rigid UK ethos. At nearly eight and a half minutes, ""Elite / Hands On"" uses its ample space to blend Shelter's predominate mentalities, collaging workmanlike grooves and heady ornamental indulgence with an impromptu precision. The resulting song isn't the brightest moment of the tracklist, though it manages to show how Moiré can simultaneously and confidently operate on a few different wavelengths.Dialing down his avant tendencies has given Moiré a fresh perspective and helped tame his music, for better or worse. There are few Hazyville remnants other than slightly askew four-on-the-floors and the odd trampled vocal clip. As such, Shelter suffers at times from a subconscious dedication to balance and restraint—it's ""No Gravity""'s unwieldy sub frequencies and the cacophonous stomp of ""Stars"" that disseminate the producer's personality, not the rote arpeggiations that color ""Mr. Figure"" with listless monochrome. But these few missteps don't tarnish Shelter's stainless-steel exterior."

Their fourth album, Shelter, produced by Birgir Jón Birgisson and featuring vocals from Slowdive’s Neil Halstead, marks that clean break.","Like Opeth’s Heritage or Darkthrone’s The Cult is Alive, Alcest’s Shelter is the sound of a band that has undergone a decisive yet inevitable metamorphosis. In all these cases, extreme metal was the chrysalis or catalyst; what emerged wasn’t the same as what came before. Opeth shed death metal for bucolic prog; Darkthrone bent black metal toward d-beat crust. Neither came as a total surprise, and neither does Shelter. Alcest have been slowly turning away from the corrosive, ambient metal of their early work—a sound that’s influenced many, most notably Deafheaven—toward an unbroken dreamscape of cushiony shoegaze. Shelter marks that clean break. The French outfit’s fourth full-length is a statement of soft-spoken apostasy that’s unflinching in its resolve. And somewhat less than stellar in its execution.The friction between ethereality and aggression is what made Alcest’s prior albums, and in particular 2010’s Écailles de Lune, so gripping. Quiet, chiming guitars meshed with thunderous riffs, and liquid-nitrogen synths bled into a bath of warm, soft vocals. Neige, the driving force behind Alcest, has allowed that friction to dissipate. What’s left feels wrung-out. Shelter’s eight songs are among the prettiest Neige has ever composed, with the happy-sad chords and bell-like hook of “Opale” bearing an unmistakable to resemblance to Chapterhouse’s “Breather”. But even Chapterhouse, among the wispiest of shoegaze groups, put more propulsion and surprise into their songs. Throughout Shelter that delicacy never lets up. Some tracks, like “La Nuit Marche Avec Moi” and “Voix Sereines”, muster enough determination to step on a distortion pedal. Beyond that, every element—from Neige’s whispery melodies to the shimmering sameness of the guitar—sticks unswervingly to the path of least resistance.Shelter leaves no room for the questioning of its shoegaze credentials. Slowdive’s Neil Halstead is brought aboard to sing the lead vocals on “Away”, yet the shoegaze founding father sounds more deflated than dreamy as he moans through the song’s vaguely chamber-folk arrangement. Something is supposed to be evoked here: bemused melancholy, maybe, or wistful longing, or pensive detachment. Whatever it is, it never coheres or connects. At least it’s a break in the fog, even if it only offers a slightly bluer hue of featureless prettiness. The album was recorded in Iceland at Sigur Rós’ studio, Sundlaugin, with Sigur Rós producer Birgir Jón Birgisson, but it doesn’t sound appreciably different than Alcest’s previous output—let alone allow for much internal variation.The 10-minute closer “Délivrance” nearly reaches escape velocity, a listless spiral of gossamer pop with brief bursts of distorted lucidity. It too collapses under its own lack of weight. Neige has stated in the past that Alcest is a project devoted to realizing in song his visions of otherworldly fantasy and wonder. In chasing that devotion, the songs themselves have been cast adrift. Still capable of great feats of mood and beauty, Alcest have transformed themselves, although not always in the best way. They’ve gone from being a remarkably innovative, influential, and singular force in a subgenre they helped create to being just another shoegaze act. That doesn’t make Shelter a bad album. As an aural analgesic, it goes down smooth and numbs what it needs to. But instead of tearing open the passageway between this world and whatever lies beyond, it shrinks that portal to the size of a keyhole."

Recently signed to Matador, the Melbourne trio Love of Diagrams invoke this moment of revolt on Mosaic, their full-length debut. With mad scientific precision, they clone that factory-town aura of blankness and unrest, as well as the bohemian suspicions of structure and prettiness for its own sake. This may as wel be a love letter to 1978. It might also have been a mere period piece, but every detail is emotionally spot-on, a lovingly crafted balance of fury and malaise.Even Love of Diagrams' bare-bones palette looks like a reaction to Thatcher-era excess. Opener ""Form and Function"" reveals a simple blueprint: nervous drumming from Monika Fikerle, low-frequency ennui from bassist Antonia Sellbach, all mantled by Luke Horton's guitarwork. After 2003's The Target Is You-- their wordless, Sonic Youth-inflected debut-- Horton and Sellbach proved they could do a great Thurston and Kim, too. Yet on its own, Sellbach's deadpan witch-chant calls to mind Siouxsie Sioux, or the other Kim. There's this classic, spellbinding hollowness to it.And it works its magic on ""Pace or the Patience"", which zips from earthbound dub to a passage of chiming lightness before reverting, inevitably, back to Sellbach's wistful indictments: ""You came in with flying colors."" Meanwhile Horton, tired of pleasantries, yells past her, ""Well, can I give it to you?"" There are a million ways this can be protest song, and a million it can't. In ""At 100%"" it could go either way, too: the steely jerk and winking corporate-speak could pass as an attack on the workplace, modern love, or, what the hell, modern love in the workplace.Better not to know. They are usually going so fast, riding their hurried Krautrock rhythms, they almost race past any stable meanings. But when they downshift to slower tempos, they tumble clearly from outrage to resignation. Somewhere under the sludge of ""Ms V Export"", you suspect, lurks a pop song, all the balladry filtered through Sellbach's robotic delivery. You can hear more notes of defeat, but in the coiled-spring, Devoesque ""Confrontation"", the hope drowns it out.Granted, historical accuracy has its downside. No wave and post-punk came from cold places, after all, and for every lightning-flash of dark and dissonant drama, there were untold stretches of dreary, bloodless austerity. Love of Diagrams undoubtedly realize this. They have learned from their forebears' mistakes, keeping Mosaic predictably terse and tense, but they achieve something else: a strange spartan beauty, full of listlessness and all kinds of longing."

It's expected: In this decade, especially in this country-- and especially with a president that treats religion like a popular mandate to run amuck-- it's hard to write seriously about Christian devotion in a rock-and-folk context without being seen as a white religious zealot on a proselytizer's stump. That's especially true if, as with Edwards, one shares the last name of the Massachusetts minister who, in 1734, fueled The Great Awakening by inventing modern revivalism.But Edwards is a songwriter on a completely different tip. He has little but his Christian faith and the confidence of his convictions and their concomitant questions to guide him. He's not a minister, and he's neither aiming from nor for the Heartland. Mosaic, the third proper album from Wovenhand and the first since the dissolution of 16 Horsepower, makes that very clear: Though most of the songs here are based in archetypical Americana banjo, acoustic guitar and massive church organ swells, Edwards borrows heavily from European Christianity for source material and on European tradition for instrumentation.""Swedish Purse"", an ode to Edwards' wife and God, lifts its melody from a medieval hymn. ""Dirty Blue"" plays primarily on violin, acoustic guitar, and percussion, but its staggered time signature and chiseled staccato violin lines speak more to Balkan than American folk. That song's heavy reliance on symbolism-- ""the book of numbers,"" amber rings, and the bells of Leuven, Belgium-- runs counter to evangelical Christianity's literalist dogma. The album's most exquisite moment, ""Truly Golden"", was even written by Edwards' Belgian guitarist, Peter Van Laerhoven. It seems Edwards-- who has recorded with Daniel Smith in the past-- has found a transcontinental network devoted to the questions of faith that permeate his songwriting, and-- by now-- its ""Americana heartland"" only on the most fundamental level.As such, Mosaic rarely sounds or reads like a pilgrim meditation of faith: ""Slota Prow"" buries Edwards' voice in an industrial din, an indecisive violin line-- split somewhere between sprightly and doleful-- slicing through his imprecations. It's more Pyschic TV than Sun Records, spirituality literally and metaphorically marred by supreme secular woe via dissonance. Such erudite extroversion doubles when Edwards delivers the song's second verse in his invented language and segues seamlessly into ""Full Armour"", an extended metaphor for the divine protection Edwards feels in his God. These images are not an ""Old Rugged Cross"" redux.They are offered as Edwards': His words are his psalms, open to empathy, not instruction. Pedagogy only appears on ""Twig"": ""Eternal creator of the world/ Who rules the day/ Who rules the night,"" Edwards intones. His voice echoes as though sung from the basilica of Milan Cathedral, the spiritual domain of Saint Ambrose, the fourth century bishop that wrote them.But Edwards' increasing distance from the American mantle that made 16 Horsepower so mighty and resilient does leave something to be desired: Songs like Horsepower's ""Blessed Persistence"" showcased his ability to work within an American primitive framework raised by songwriters like Johnny Cash, a troubleman grappling with hell and heaven. Very little on Mosaic pushes that zone of familiarity and immediacy into new contexts, choosing instead to reroute those questions through different musical molds and associations. But Edwards' heart and soul are still here, questioning, wondering and waiting, ""New Morning on the stereo…inside the home [where] the folk pine grow."""

Their best songs contained the nervy balance between happy and sad: smiling and frowning weren’t an either/or, but layers of a single gloriously conflicted expression.","""Are you smiling? Are you frowning?"", sings Pete Shelley on ""Keep on Believing"", one of the best tracks on Buzzcocks’ otherwise tepid ninth album The Way. It’s a set of questions the band has been asking their listeners—and themselves—for 38 years. Following the departure of lead singer Howard Devoto soon after the release of their 1977 debut EP, Spiral Scratch, guitarists Pete Shelley and Steve Diggle took over as co-frontmen; from there, Buzzcocks perfected pop-punk before it even existed as such, infusing blurred, breakneck punk anthems with doomed romanticism, anti-macho tenderness, and a flair for nerdy screeds about technology and morality. At the heart of those Buzzcocks classics, though, was the nervy balance between happy and sad. Smiling and frowning weren’t an either/or, but layers of a single gloriously conflicted expression. Which only makes The Way feel even flimsier by comparison.Buzzcocks’ most recent album was 2006’s solid Flat-Pack Philosophy, but those intervening eight years don’t mean much in Buzzcocks-time. Shelley, Diggle, and their shifting rhythm section (now comprising Chris Remington and Danny Farrante) have taken long breaks before, starting with the band’s original dissolution in 1981. If anything, The Way is a chance to flaunt the fruits of their latest rejuvenation. That chance is only barely taken. The album alternates neatly between Shelley- and Diggle-sung tracks, and Shelley’s songs mostly hover in the mediocre range. ""Keep on Believing"" squanders a grabby opening and some vicious velocity by failing to summon a deep enough hook, which Buzzcocks songs live and die by. In fact, the majority of Shelley’s contributions to The Way seem to forget that speed, distortion, and melody don’t mean anything unless they sync up into something that sticks in the ear; ""The Way"" and ""Out of the Blue"" also come on strong then quickly evaporate, while ""It’s Not You"" and ""Virtually Real"" come closest to grasping, if weakly, what Buzzcocks once uncontestedly owned. When ""Virtually Real"" tries to take on the dehumanization of social media, it almost works—the disconnect between true love and false fronts is, after all, Buzzcocks’ wheelhouse—until Shelley’s rant against trolls becomes what it hates.Diggle has always been more erratic a songwriter than Shelley, and that hasn’t changed on The Way. His voice is gluey and growly when matched against Shelley’s boyish, heartbroken coo, but Diggle’s compositions define both the highest and lowest points of the album. On the overwhelmingly positive side is ""Chasing Rainbows/Modern Times"", which is not only the best song on The Way, but the only song here worthy of being canonized into the group’s stable of classics. After a verse that puts a deft twist on the most basic pop-punk riff of all time, that of the Ramones’ ""Blitzkrieg Bop"", Diggle’s indelible yelp carries the song through with nasal, nonsensical catchiness. ""In the Back"" is almost as good, but Diggle mars it with limp strings of clichés (""Everything’s not what it seems/ And what you give is what you get""); the turgid ""People Are Strange Machines"" doesn’t get any cleverer than its Doors-referencing title. His voice almost disintegrates on ""Third Dimension"", an embarrassing pastiche of 21st-century frat-garage stomp, but it’s miles better than the five plodding, go-nowhere minutes of the self-serious ""Saving Yourself"".At their best, Buzzcocks can turn punk rock into a paean to bubblegum, bad love poems, and the Beatles. That bipolar exhilaration is evident on The Way, but it doesn’t snag as well as it could. Instead of jittery counterpoint, there’s a lax wobbliness to these songs, and that lack of interplay—both vocally and guitar-wise—is the album’s most glaring omission. Energy isn’t the problem; they just don’t know what to do with it. Every song here wants to be an anthem, and a couple almost hit the mark, but the majority are barely worthy of jingle-hood. The Way is the converse of what Buzzcocks fans might have come to expect from the band at this point in the game: Instead of growing soft and slick while retaining their songwriting prowess, they’ve stayed fast and raw—but left much of their popcraft somewhere behind."

Raised on the West Side of Atlanta, the red-hot teenager caught a breakout moment earlier this year with the threat-fueled single “Murder Bitch,” which shaves down YoungBoy’s sound to a growling delivery and anger. But YoungBoy is so much more than that, he’s rarely ever just angry, there’s sadness, pain, and regret bubbling under the surface even when he’s not explicitly saying that. Those layers weren’t always instantly identifiable, but through years of YoungBoy laying out his story and developing his vocal tics on countless mixtapes did it all come together.Anti da Menace’s newest mixtape, Legendary, skips a couple of steps. Like a YoungBoy album, the sound ranges from tender melodic ballads to brash, drill-inflected diss tracks, yet the emotion is unearned. Of the more vulnerable tracks, which are the type of songs where we’ve learned more about YoungBoy than any interview, Anti da Menace isn’t actually that vulnerable. “Flamethrower” has the elements of what sounds like he’s pouring his heart out—strained vocals, a weepy piano-driven beat, vague words of advice from his mom—but he doesn’t actually say anything to back up the mood. It’s completely relying on our pre-existing knowledge that this is what more downbeat Southern pain rap songs sound like, without doing any of the work. “Forgive Me” is similarly impersonal, there’s not much that makes the song about Anti da Menace, the vagueness is an assumption that we already know his story which makes the lines ring hollow.He’s a lot better off making songs like “Murder Bitch” even if they are a bit one-note. Similar to how Florida rapper Cochise cordoned off a small bit of Playboi Carti by running off with his helium-voiced flow, Anti da Menace does a pretty good imitation of YoungBoy’s menacing side. On “Blood Boy,” arguably the album’s best song, Anti Da Menace’s snarling delivery is so intense that he could probably rip his t-shirt with his bare hands a la Hulk Hogan. The lyrics where he tries to paint the most violent images possible have no weight to them other than shock, but the energy covers it up well enough. Then over a slightly groovier version of SleazyWorld Go’s “Sleazy Flow” on “Switchblade,” he shows some skill by channeling his anger through a gravelly melody instead of snapping. Meanwhile, “223” goes in the opposite direction: The moment a funky bassline becomes more pronounced in the thrashing beat, his growls are cranked up so much that the relatively clean mix can’t stop his vocals from cracking. It’s the weirdest moment on an album that could have used a lot more weird moments.Even when Anti da Menace occasionally breaks free from the YoungBoy mold, there’s still not much that sounds specific to him. “Enemies” has the acoustic guitar-led frame of a NoCap track, but he’s not lyrical enough to carry that. “Outta Bounds” starts out like a King Von–style crime short, and despite the two-minute runtime, he runs out of story about halfway through. His most promising moment is “Red Rum,” which has shades of Lil Durk with the way he blends the ruthless spirit of drill with Southern pain melodies. And while it’s a bit of a tired sound, at least the focus is more on his relentlessness and not on what he’s saying. Because, hey, not having much to say is fine, the problem comes up when he’s working within styles of rap that basically require that. Leave the balladry to YoungBoy and he’ll be alright."

Her second album is a masterful study of being a young woman, a sleek and humid pop record full of grief and hedonism, crafted with the utmost care and wisdom.","“Fluorescent”—has there ever been a better descriptor for first love? When Lorde sings it to the empty space beside her on “Supercut,” toward the end of her shining record Melodrama, we share a bit of her noted synesthesia: We see that bright, electrode glow of possibility, feel its siren shine on our faces. That neon is too beautiful to last, though; its buzz requires an effortful chemistry.But when it is gone, the rest need not pale by comparison. The same could be said for one’s teenage years, which the 20-year-old Ella Yelich-O’Connor exits so graciously on this album. That formative era is a fraught time for girls, a dizzying span in which they’re most sought for beauty and cultural cachet yet their perspectives are forcefully minimized. Hear a song from a singer who taps their first euphorias, but know it’s merely real adults’ “fetishization.” Try to understand your ever-changing physiology, then have a porcine politician insist that it’s not yours to protect. And the growing pains feel endless; while it is horrible to be a teen girl who isn’t taken seriously by society, it’s even worse being a young woman unsure what to do with the autonomy that threatens it.Melodrama is Lorde’s study of being a young woman finding her own conviction in unsteady circumstances. Sometimes, this also involves being single—a breakup and a raucous house party serve as thematic through-lines—but romance is only part of the album’s script. In the difficult, exhilarating course of the record, written largely when Lorde was 18 and 19, her true reward comes with her embrace of self. As a nod to her clearest pop forbearer, her peace is in accepting that she will, sometimes, end up dancing on her own.Like her 2013 debut Pure Heroine, Melodrama is a work of sleek self-possession, packed with bursts of peculiar rhymes and production that confound expected song formulas. However, while Heroine cast off the trappings of materialism atop spacious trip-pop, Melodrama catches the mist off of New Wave rhythms that befit the name. (Bleachers’ Jack Antonoff, in his first production for Lorde, leaves a pliant and romantic thumbprint throughout; Heroine veteran Joel Little also returns.) Its first single and opening track, “Green Light,” casts a long shadow in its anthemic bliss. There’s a reason Max Martin called the New Zealander’s approach “incorrect songwriting”—by no Top 40 rubric should her song fire off, within its first 60 seconds, a spectral synthesizer wobble, a strident line of house piano, a subterranean vocal plunge, and an apropos-of-nothing gear shift that feels like storm clouds ebbing to the sun. Her lyrics, too, occupy an underexplored space; reams have been written about volatile breakups and last-call debauchery, but Lorde rages in a self-aware hedonism, reckless in grief yet knowing that tomorrow her heart will begin to heal. (“But I hear sounds in my mind/Brand new sounds in my mind,” she exults, after thoroughly mocking the bastard in falsetto sing-song.)"

Their music combines elements of both groups, but it nearly became a casualty of the industry's current financial mess. Disappears were the very last act signed to Touch and Go before the label shut down, and as a result, their debut, Lux, was almost lost in the shuffle. Luckily they were eventually scooped up by Kranky, and though their style differs considerably from the experimental and ambient that label is known for, it seems a good fit for Disappears' dense and foreboding sound.Disappears' sound is a pared-down, drone-heavy mixture of Velvet Underground scuzz, garage-rock energy, and krautrock propulsion. It may not feel like the most unique approach, but, importantly, the band seems aware of that. Part of Disappears' appeal is that they've chosen to work within a set of stylistic and sonic limitations, where vocals and instrumentation are stripped back to their most essential. It's more about minimalism and mastering the basics than making something brand-new.It works because Disappears keep things tight; even though there's heaviness and repetition in these tracks, usually they're about three minutes long. ""Gone Completely"" is a killer opener, a rush of fuzz-laden guitars and simple, severe drumming. On this track and throughout the album, frontman Case's vocals are buried in the mix just right-- his delivery is kind of a Britt Daniel-meets-Iggy Pop sing-speak-- and clouded in the feedback his words sound more powerful, like they're trying to escape. The band mostly finds a comfortable zone and rides it, but each track tweaks the formula just so, and the mood stays jet-black dark throughout.Things do start to feel a bit same-y toward the end of the record. On ""Little Ghost"" and ""New Cross"", it sounds like the band is revisiting ideas they touched on earlier. But when a group is working in such tight confines, some overlap is natural. That the goal here is intentionally limited ultimately works for and against Disappears-- they achieve the sound they want, and it does sound good, but it's hard to think of Lux as much more than that, because the components are so familiar. Still, that they're able to make these well-worn rock tropes feel quite so menacing after all this time is an achievement in its own right."

More interestingly, there are very few moments during the last decade-plus that this statement wouldn't be mostly true. The Scottish producer crafts dark, ornate music that seems intentionally at odds with electronic music's current fixation on luminescent house sounds; he has a reputation for minimalism, but his productions seem too roiling to slot into whatever sounds that word represents. Dubstep is similarly deep and ominous, but Smoke sounds steely and focused, not foggy and stoned. On his third album, Lux, he again uses tough arpeggios, mumbled vocals, and furrowed percussion to enact mini-dramas of industrial techno.Though Lux can evoke comforting sadness, its orchestral bent and general meticulousness keep it from ever feeling truly despairing. So the album offers these small perversions of mood without becoming overbearing. Because he obscures his voice and has a reputation for making complete albums (as opposed to singles), Smoke's work has been compared to Thom Yorke's solo outing, The Eraser. While both share an affinity for the hardscrabble rhythms of mid-1990s IDM, Smoke's compositions are less linear and song-oriented. The 14 tracks on Lux often stretch past six minutes, but Smoke doesn't build to climaxes so much as sniff out every corner of his creations.Lux is Smoke's least motive album yet-- only the most generous definitions of ""dance"" would include this music-- but these tracks don't idle, they prowl. When Smoke increases the tempos-- the thrumming ""Blingkered"", the lite-rave of ""Pilk""-- his songs sound tense, not celebratory. You can connect the lurching ""Physic"" or ""Lux+"" to Hyperdub's smeared sound attacks, but minus the exposed-nerve bass. Lux occasionally sounds like Coil's snake-y masterpiece, Love's Secret Domain, but that album alluded to sex and drugs (or maybe druggy sex), and Alex Smoke seems chiefly concerned with Alex Smoke.More than anything, Lux feels self-contained: produced by a single artist and released on Smoke's own Hum + Haw imprint, it projects dark vistas that feel deeply personal. Unlike many techno artists, Smoke builds his albums for sitdown sessions (EPs containing floor-friendly versions of ""Lux+"" and ""Blingkered"" are already available) and has seemingly little concern for where these dense, thoughtful behemoths fit in a broader context. Forunately, Lux needs little besides an accommodating, stormy mindset for its hum and shiver to make sense."

In 1983, a guy named Randall Wulff showed up at Music Lab studio in Los Angeles with a white Mercedes convertible, a beautiful girlfriend, perfect hair, and a handful of ethereal synth-pop-folk tunes. Wulff then hired photographer Ed Colver, best known for documenting the West Coast punk scene, to shoot the starkly monochromatic album cover. By the time Colver realized the check had bounced, Wulff had disappeared. There were rumors that he had gone to Las Vegas or possibly Hawaii, but most likely he had returned to Alberta, Canada, where nearly twenty-five years later a vinyl collector named Jon Murphy came across a copy of L’Amour at a flea market.Full of gently dissolving melodies and gossamer synths (credited to a guy named Philip Lees, also a mystery), the album has become crate-digger lore, as much for the backstory as for the music itself. As of this reissue, Wulff remains at large. Was he a con man, as some claim? A drug dealer, as others attest? An apparition? An alien visitor? A record collector hoax? Did he really have connections to the Duke Power fortune? Was he really involved with Christie Brinkley? How does cowboy novelist Louis L’Amour fit into the story? And where is Wulff now, if he is still around? Jack D. Fleischer, the filmmaker/historian who penned the liners and spent years looking for the artist, tracked down Wulff’s nephew, who had vivid memories of his uncle but lost touch with him many years ago. Fleischer came across another pseudonym under which Wulff recorded a few other albums, but he neglects to disclose the name. “As of this writing,” he notes, “Randall is essentially a ghost.”The hazy story doesn’t bolster the music, but rather seems an extension of this strange and singular album. If you think of Los Angeles in the early ‘80s, you’re probably thinking New Wave synth-pop, cocaine-fueled and neon-lit—and L’Amour is anything but. Rather than sunny and hook-laden, these songs convey an ephemeral melancholy, blurred at the edges yet more potent for being somewhat indistinct. This is music of retreat, not assertion. The synths rise and ebb curiously, occasionally punctuating the songs with quiet starbursts but mostly moving with a logic of their own, often with no regard for Lewis’s vocals or piano playing. He doesn’t sing so much as he mumbles melodically, as though perpetually falling awake. The effect is quieting but too spooky to be New Agey. If Randall Wulff was an L.A. player, then Lewis was a bedroom auteur."

He’s not the kind of vicar to pass around the collection plate; there are pentagrams and animal skulls dispersed throughout. He levitates menacingly, his hair’s an angry shade of crimson, there’s a green serpent here as well. Neat!Trippie Redd’s brand of emo rap is similarly hackneyed. That doesn’t stop him from making these consummate odes to heartbreak. But while his sad songs sound a touch more authentic and sensible here, the overall doom-and-gloom shtick is starting to wear thin. A Love Letter to You 3 showcases the benefits of refining a long-running aesthetic while also revealing its main limitation: the looming sense that things are getting a bit stale.Trippie Redd’s caterwauling makes his music endearing when it connects and grating when it misses. Since the release of A Love Letter to You 2, he’s tuned-up his emotional screeches to sound a little more soothing and milky. A Love Letter to You 3 begins with “Topanga” that builds a somber soundtrack for Trippie’s most vulnerable-sounding carols yet. He sings about gunplay with newly polished vocals.  Gone are the simplistic choruses and general sleaze weighed down his songwriting; in its place is a multi-part refrain that indicates a degree of familiarity with his faults. It quickly establishes a familiar somber mood that gets further excavated throughout the project as he digs into emo rap’s fascination with brandishing pain’s outcomes. The idea isn’t novel but it’s a little more fleshed out than many of his peers.Thankfully, he’s not chasing hits, which made Life’s a Trip an uneven slog. A Love Letter to You 3 is a blended affair of melancholy music with a gentle alt-rock atmosphere and plucky guitar strings throughout. “Toxic Waste” blooms smooth and slowly, similar to the slightly more lively “Love Scars 3.” Its consistency, aside from the drowning 808s of “1400/999 Freestyle” which feature an eye-rolling tough guy act from Juice WRLD, lends to its authenticity and flowing nature. Without the potholes, it’s a smoother ride.But while consistency can be read as a strong point, it also makes these songs naggingly predictable. This is the third installment of his flagship series and, now, the tortured-soul act is wearing thin. “I Tried Loving” borders on pestering whining with a heartless ode about heartbreak. There’s at least four relationship-ending songs up here and they begin to bleed together after a couple of listens. Without the bright, creative spots, the doom and gloom begin to feel manufactured to adhere to an aesthetic that he seems lost without. This is frightening because when there’s nothing zippy left to snap attention to, interest begins to wane. A Love Letter 3 is hopefully a farewell for Trippie’s puppy-eyed passages. This is a rare case where the music can be technically sound, yet be largely dismissible because there’s no growth. Emo rap is a crowded space with more innovative artists than Trippie; to eat again, he’ll need to change up his hunting style."

When Lorde sings it to the empty space beside her on “Supercut,” toward the end of her shining record Melodrama, we share a bit of her noted synesthesia: We see that bright, electrode glow of possibility, feel its siren shine on our faces. That neon is too beautiful to last, though; its buzz requires an effortful chemistry.But when it is gone, the rest need not pale by comparison. The same could be said for one’s teenage years, which the 20-year-old Ella Yelich-O’Connor exits so graciously on this album. That formative era is a fraught time for girls, a dizzying span in which they’re most sought for beauty and cultural cachet yet their perspectives are forcefully minimized. Hear a song from a singer who taps their first euphorias, but know it’s merely real adults’ “fetishization.” Try to understand your ever-changing physiology, then have a porcine politician insist that it’s not yours to protect. And the growing pains feel endless; while it is horrible to be a teen girl who isn’t taken seriously by society, it’s even worse being a young woman unsure what to do with the autonomy that threatens it.Melodrama is Lorde’s study of being a young woman finding her own conviction in unsteady circumstances.

It is a warm and delicate pop album about life as a young gay man.,"I’m willing to go out on a limb and say that Troye Sivan gets it. The Australian YouTuber-turned-pop star has all the qualifications you’d look for in a modern-day gay icon—a devoted army of long-time fans, elfin features, celebrities and designers on speed dial—and the good sense to recognize how meaningless and outmoded that kind of title is. “I just don’t represent everybody, because I’m extraordinarily lucky,” Sivan told British style magazine Another Man in May. “I come from a middle-class white family in Australia, and all of my dreams have come true by 22. I had the easiest coming out in the world… There are plenty of other people who need to be heard first.”Give him an opportunity, and he’ll happily rattle off the names of other musicians at the vanguard of queer representation: Sam Smith, Halsey, Kehlani, Perfume Genius, Kevin Abstract, Hayley Kiyoko. He invited Kim Petras on tour as an opening act and deftly handled the ensuing backlash over her work with Dr. Luke, making donations to the Ally Coalition and RAINN. His humility would feel performative and cynical if it weren’t so thorough. Blink and you might forget why Sivan is holding court on these topics in the first place: He’s an evolutionary artist, one whose existence and career is the product of decades of baby steps and boundary-pushing. Being gay is an integral and visible part of Sivan’s art, just as much as his voice or his choice of collaborators.Bloom, Sivan’s second studio album, is best described in terms you rarely see associated with male pop stars: delicacy, transparency, and vulnerability. He sings about experiences that are commonplace for young gay men in 2018 but feel totally transgressive in a broader pop context. He wrote opener “Seventeen” about sneaking onto Grindr with a fake ID and hooking up with older men, and the title track captures bottoming for the first time in all of its agony and ecstasy.The subject matter draws headlines, but it’s less revelatory than what’s between the lines. You can feel the power dynamics underpinning each of these songs shifting in unpredictable ways. Sivan starts both “Seventeen” and “Bloom” in a playful mood, teasing his partner, flirting, issuing commands. He’s an object of desire, and that puts him in control. “I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break,” he taunts on “Seventeen.” “Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me.” Just a few seconds later, he’s lost his footing: the older man he’s sought out for a virgin fling might not be so easy to manipulate in the heat of the moment. The “Bloom” pre-chorus is a nervous whimper—“I need you to tell me right before it goes down/Promise me you’ll hold my hand if I get scared now”—just before Sivan relaxes and enjoys the ride."

Today we revisit Kesha's whiskey-soaked 2010 debut, a ridiculously fun and somewhat fraught album whose garish aesthetic is being channeled anew.","Squinting at the paper in front of him, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Paul Muldoon recites a few lines in a halting, soporific tone, the kind one expects from an aging humanities professor, which he is. “I’m talking about everybody getting”—he pauses, leaning forward to verify what he’s reading—“crunk, crunk. Boys try to touch my junk, junk.” The year is 2010. Muldoon and his tweed blazer have been summoned by Princeton University’s humor magazine for an arch literary critique of Kesha’s “TiK ToK,” which a student introduces deadpan as “one of the most seminal, interesting, and frankly deeply beautiful songs of the last 20 years.” The segment juxtaposes the mannered rhetoric of the Ivy League with Kesha’s dippy slang. It’s intended to be clever, signaling that these men are attuned to a class and culture and far above her, blah, blah, blah. They sound like total losers.“TiK ToK”—that wretched and awesome concoction of white-girl rapping, lurid Auto-Tune, and ridiculous quips—was the 22-year-old Kesha’s breakthrough single. By her account, it was inspired by an epic morning when she woke up “surrounded by a bunch of hot babes” and felt she was living it up like Diddy. (Hence the single’s indelible first line.) Immediately, she established herself as everything a good girl shouldn’t be: insolent, hedonistic, and trashy, with a devil-may-care approach to dental hygiene. She droned on about clothes and phones, and deployed vernacular (“crunk” and “errybody” and “po-po”) clumsily borrowed from hip-hop. The single seemed almost designed to irritate: because of Kesha’s fried, bratty voice, or her “oh, whoa, whoa, oh”s that resembled yodeling, or her twisted suggestion that she was attracted to Mick Jagger. It was the first No. 1 hit of the 2010s, one of the era’s many glorious, stupid anthems about getting schwasted because YOLO. When asked why her music resonated, Kesha replied pithily: “It’s not pretentious …. When there’s a recession and times can be hard, dancing is free.”In a perfect bit of mythology, Kesha Rose Sebert was allegedly born at a party in the San Fernando Valley—a place that looms large in the nightmares of misogynists and pedants because it’s where young women “like” and “um” freely. She didn’t know her father. Her mother, Pebe Sebert, was the bohemian songwriter who co-wrote the 1978 country single “Old Flames Can’t Hold a Candle to You,” which became a No. 1 hit in the hands of Dolly Parton. After securing a publishing deal, Pebe relocated the family to Nashville, often taking Kesha and her brothers to recording studios. She and Kesha would work on songs together for fun after school, eventually co-writing three tracks that appear on Kesha’s debut, Animal."

(Hell, given that a few days ago it was pushing 90 and humid as Bonecrusher's jockstrap, we may have skipped spring and gone straight to July.) The sky is a beautful, uh, sky blue, with only a handful of cottonball clouds dotting it. The leaves have exploded like paintball pellets against trees that only a few weeks ago were still bare. The bugs are hovering, somewhere in the distance a lawnmower is buzzing, and I am drinking lemonade. In short, it's exactly the opposite of the mood conjured by Superpitcher's new mix Today.Superpitcher is house for mopers. He turns the dancefloor into one big pity party. Unlike other attempts at ""goth house"" (the brutalist Gallic bombast of Black Strobe or their forebears in EBM acts like Front242, for instance), he doesn't hammer you into submission like a camp Danzig hip to Derrick May. He sulks, like a scrawny teenager replaying ""Computer Love"" and ""Neon Lights"" over and over to soothe a broken heart. In his own tracks like ""Heroin"" and his remixes for artists like M83, he takes a trudging mid-tempo house pattern that seems to be pushing against its own inertia and pickles it in a brine of gloomy-yet-euphoric synths. Though Today contains only one of his own productions, it's definitely all of a piece. And if it doesn't contain individual tracks that hit the highs of Kompakt's previous goth-mix masterpiece, Michael Mayer's Immer, then as a mood muzik whole (imagine a train ride across the damp Germanic countryside) it's up there.DJ Koze's ""Let's Help Me"" rustles and bustles along like the midway point between electrohouse and the uncomfortable intestinal intimacy of Jan Jelinek's Farben productions. (I especially like the really thin, almost slivered hi-hats.) The lyrics and luded Nico (not an oxymoron, I swear) delivery of Michael Mayer's ""Lovefood"" are so archly ridiculous (""give me love/ So I can/ Kill""...girl, please) that no remix can save it, except perhaps a total Aphexian overhaul. Triola's ""Leuchtturm (Wighnomy's Polarzipper Remix)"" squelches and chirps at uncomfortable (p)op-art angles, something like a Depeche Mode B-side in dub. The compulsive bassline of Oliver Hacke's ""21:31"" gets peeled back by the jacking drums of the Psychonauts' ""World Keeps Turning (Highfish & Zander Remix)"" with vocals straight out of '85.The old school techno jock of Nathan Fake's ""Dinamo"" sets up the killer tune of the whole mix, the Wighnomy Bros' ""Wurz + Blosee"". The masters of creative thrift throw all their weight on a hypnotic b-line that maintains an almost unbearable tension simply by skipping up or down an octave after eight bars. There's a secondary beat they drop around 2:30 in, but mostly it's just the bassline, leading you around the dancefloor like a pied piper. Max Mohr's ""Old Song"" sounds like jazz house played on particularly rusty, rattling set of traps. Even faded-- like an old photocopy-- the shock of hearing something so traditional sounding on Kompakt is thrilling. (The matte synths that lurk in the back of the mix bring us closer to the Kpakt gold standard for wistful melodicism.) The chunky groove of Sebastian Tellier's ""La Ritournelle"" almost sounds like broken beat, albeit slower (and less broken). Soundtrack strings and AOR ballad pianos attempt to briefly rouse our spirits. I am glad someone remembered that everybody loves the sunshine."

The group recorded the album before Donald Trump’s victory—as Dave Chappelle, who hosted SNL that night, repeatedly argued, Trump was merely sticking his finger in existing fault lines—but the results gave it new gravity. It was a moment of philosophical as well as aesthetic triumph for Tribe, their prescience made obvious.Not all its members made it there to gloat. During the second verse of the galvanizing “We the People…,” when Phife Dawg’s vocals kicked in, Q-Tip and Jarobi shuffled to the stage wings, making room for a giant banner with Phife’s face to be unfurled. NBC’s cameras zoomed in on the late rapper’s picture until the living ones reappeared in the frame to play hypeman for their friend, their backs turned to the studio audience, egging on a static image.The performance was less than eight months after Phife, born Malik Taylor, had died from diabetes-related complications at the age of 45. In the nearly 20 years between The Love Movement and We got it from Here, Phife, dogged by ill health and still frustrated over the dynamics that led to Tribe’s breakup, released little music. Forever, his first posthumous album—assembled by his longtime DJ, Dion Liverpool, from largely unfinished demos—reveals what had become most important to Phife in his post-Tribe years: family and a particular kind of integrity, where teaching a child to read and not fucking up a cypher are interconnected parts of one worldview. It also shows a dexterous vocal style that is more easily transposed across eras than longtime listeners might have imagined.Phife and Q-Tip met when they were children attending the same Seventh Day Adventist church in Queens. But where Q-Tip was free to pursue his secular interests—his father was a jazz collector, and the opening verse to The Low End Theory recounts an informed back-and-forth about musical styles between father and son—Phife’s family adhered more strictly to the faith. He wasn’t permitted to hear hip-hop, much less participate in it, except in surreptitious doses outside the home. This is perhaps why, if Q-Tip could turn moodily inward or grapple with abstract social issues, Phife’s raps always felt more purely social. He was trying to intimidate or entertain, always playing to the block parties in his memory."

When local officials shuttered the space in the wake of the 2016 Oakland Ghost Ship fire, Johnston and her close friend Colin Ward were two of 15 local musicians displaced. A little over a year later, Ward died unexpectedly. The back-to-back losses left Johnston feeling suffocated by sorrow, disconnected from her community in a city that no longer felt like home. She immersed herself in the songwriting process until she resurfaced with Forever, a collection of candid, minimalist shoegaze that grapples with the impermanence of life.With the barren dream-pop of album opener “2018,” she surveys the year and forces herself to accept the truth, repeating, “This is really happening” until the words go numb. There’s always been an air of detachment to Midwife’s music—2017’s Like Author, Like Daughter sounds like anesthetized Grouper—but here she sounds trapped, stuck in the purgatory of grief. On lead single “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” which sounds nothing like the Radiohead song, a hazy wash of guitar floods the air as she lies flat on her back, fixated on the desire to outrun her life yet pinned beneath the minute hand of a clock. It’s the type of warm, melancholic drone you want to pull up to your chin like a weighted blanket, and she wisely follows it with “Vow,” a heartbreaking instrumental that spaces out its lone piano chords so each one falls like a teardrop.Midwife is the rare artist who can wallow in pain without indulging self-pity. She performs her own kind of therapeutic practice on “C.R.F.W.,” a nearly nine-minute sprawl that opens with a recording of Ward reading an original poem about desire and fate, originally commissioned for the 2011 collaborative project Pure Becoming. His recitation is empathetic, spiritual, spoken in a flat tone with no audience in mind. In the final line, he compares death to a falling leaf: “Imagine the way a breeze feels against your leaf body when you finally don’t have to hold on anymore.” It’s not the poem itself that’s so remarkable, but the way Midwife follows his words with ambient drone and tectonic synth hums, turning it into a moving homage that feels like a hypnagogic meditation on the possibility of an afterlife.Johnston calls her music “heaven metal,” and Forever is heavy and hypnotic, full of nearly wordless ruminations on the pain of loss. But while the album begins as an outlet for grief, it grows towards zen-like acceptance of death. Closer “S.W.I.M.” capitalizes on Midwife’s strengths—blown-out fuzz, lethargic percussion, a pop of melody that appears like a daydream—to mirror her lyrics: “Treading water my whole life/I don’t want to swim forever/Reaching for the other side.” Forever is first and foremost a tribute to Ward, but its strength lies in the power of Johnston’s singular experience to unlock communal knowledge: that the mourning process never really becomes less painful, but so long as it’s inevitable, we need not feel alone."

Man’s first video accused the 29-year-old Jamaican deejay of putting on false airs about his humble roots, and the follow-up diss track warned him against surpassing his place. In the past, Popcaan might have entertained a response, like the “Stray Dog” clapback when Alkaline took jabs at his masculinity. Now, though, he prefers leaving those badmind rivals on read. For Popcaan (born Andrae Jay Sutherland), asserting dominance over the Kingston microcosm is an unspoken flex: He lets the private jet, the gold chains around his neck, and a Midas-touch cosign from Drake do the talking. Landing a full four years after his summer 2014 debut Where We Come From, Popcaan’s second album peacocks the wealth of his international pop celebrity. Forever is an overflowing chalice, and he’s is overly eager to offer us a sip.In late June, the head of Unruly records described manifesting his destiny (in the form of high-profile collaborations with Jamie xx, Pusha-T, Gorillaz, among others) to radio host Zane Lowe, saying: “I keep my thoughts clean and positive.” Fittingly, Popcaan continues to boast his untouchable purity on Forever. The first song “Silence” contemplates the paranoia of fame, but gives reassurance: “And my heart clean, filled with love/And mi meditation sharp like studs.” His chief conspirator and Mixpak Records’ Brooklyn beatmaker Dre Skull makes an equally dignified return, imbuing the song with sonic gravitas through quickening thrums of bass and misty atmospherics. Spirituality is the current that electrifies Forever. On “Firm & Strong,” the glory of a 20-person choir shake stained glass windows with Popcaan’s soulful affirmations. The bookend “A Wha Suh” is a sincere pep-talk from a psalm-slinging confidant—only to be rendered banal by mid-range piano chords from step-in producer Not Nice.Each blessing Popcaan counts strengthens his carefree swagger. Rather than the accidental intersection of pop and dancehall that sprung from Where We Come From, his sinewy melodies and Dre Skull’s grooves here are more deliberate angles towards mainstream audiences. He claims this bid for the spotlight with the same rigor his soaring croons hurtle over the sparkly synth lines on “Superstar.” Framed within a rags-to-riches context, the singalong chorus, “Man a star, man a star/Man a super,” knows everyone cheers when the underdog punches the air amidst a thrilling recovery. Equally infectious is “Happy Now,” where Popcaan’s wavering ad libs undergo a slight AutoTune treatment, a correction very evocative of pop tradition.Forever falters when Popcaan confronts romantic limitations. At least the lusty rhapsodies on “Naked” and the cries of “Wine fi the money now” on “Dun Rich” own their irreverence. He barely musters a convincing lilt to carry the words “Girl you love me for free, yeah/This must be love” on the vapid “Through the Storm.” What’s worse is the cloying guitars in the background with a twang borrowed from sine feeble boy band 10 years his junior. Wrestling ballads away from weak sentimentalism requires a higher degree of finesse than assembling hip-swaying hits.Entering the big pop arena often comes with the question of superficiality, of watering down truth, or tuning up reality for the onlooker. The charisma underneath Popcaan’s veneer of wealth saves his work from feeling entirely contrived. However, like panning for precious metals, Forever requires sieving through plates of glinting sediment before discovering treasure. The album is best when luxuriating in its own divine intensity, when an earnest Popcaan reconciles the hunger of his past with the feasting of his present, hands clasped in grace."

The Pittsburgh savants—musical partners since high school, barely legal at the time of their 2012 signing, long barred from the club circuit due to their age—have certainly paid their dues. They’ve spent the past decade plotting and pummeling their way from the hardcore underground to rock’s MainStage, touring with everyone from Full of Hell and Touché Amoré to Deftones and the Misfits and recording under the guidance of two of the most respected luminaries in their genre. Their first two albums (2012’s Love Is Love // Return to Dust and 2014’s I Am King) were released on Converge frontman Jacob Bannon’s Deathwish Inc. label, and produced by his bandmate Kurt Ballou, one of metal’s most highly-regarded board wizards. And yet, even as they stay the course, the group continue to grapple with their precocious past, leading some to reframe them as interlopers, snooty art school kids trying to act tough.Certainly, Code Orange’s aesthetic and presence involve plenty of mean mugging: grisly music videos and artwork, on-the-record refusals to tour with acts they consider “bargain-bin deathcore bands,” unflinching accounts of in-studio fist fights, vows of Darwinist vengeance against the “fake rockstar mentality” espoused by scene hotshots like Asking Alexandra (“They will be the first to go,” the self-proclaimed “thinners of the herd” stated ominously in a Facebook post). With their third LP and major-label debut Forever, Code Orange have offered up compelling, caustic–occasionally, even catchy–evidence that their claims of intra-scene superiority are, for the most part, justified.Despite all this talk, the Code Orange crew's approach is surprisingly communal. There’s no bandleader to speak of; instead, we’ve got a vocal tag-team between drummer Jami Morgan and guitarists Reba Meyers and Eric Balderose, the latter of whom’s on power electronics duty as well. They’re less a trio than a cacophonous hydra fighting with itself, each head bearing a distinctive battle cry: Morgan’s razor-throated yelps and deadpanned raps; Meyers’ piercing shrieks, alternated with the haunting alto typically reserved for her pop-punk side project, Adventures; and Balderose’s guttural death growls. This multivalence is partially to blame for the album’s erratic atmosphere; rather than reconcile these disparate approaches, the band duke things out in turn, leaving the guitar hooks (and Joe Goldman’s unfussed, even-keel bass playing) to tie everything together. Sometimes, a twisted choir forms: the half-sung, half-shouted chorus of “The Mud” for instance, or the end of “Hurt Goes On.”"

However, its 39 minutes often run together.","A lot more goes into release dates than ""seasonal appropriateness,"" I realize, but Painted Palms' Forever sure doesn't feel like a January record. The long-gestating debut LP from the San Francisco psych-pop duo is a bright, spangling, decidedly summery affair, all radiant harmonies and warm reverberations. Forever's pleasures are simple, breezy, a little like bringing a parka to the pool: you're supposed to dive right in, not waste a lot of time peeling back the layers. Forever is lush, easygoing, 39 balmy minutes in paradise. But spend too much time in these all-too-pleasant surroundings, and you can't help but feel like you've been there before.Cousins Reese Donohue and Christopher Prudhomme planted the seeds of Painted Palms when the pair were separated by a dozen states, gradually building up tracks from the snippets they'd shoot back-and-forth through email. And, though they've both called San Francisco home for a number of years, Forever's shimmering construction is mostly in line with their earlier efforts. Like a lot of young bands, they're certainly not shy about their fondness for the Beach Boys and their legions of sonic followers; especially Animal Collective, and even more especially, Panda Bear's 2007 landmark Person Pitch. The Palms do have a few legs up on much of the not-exactly-thin post-Pitch crowd; their sound's fuller, the sense of melody better defined. And, in Prudhomme, they've got a singer who serves as their answer to Noah Lennox. On ""Too High,"" for instance, Prudhomme cuts through the track's radar-gun reverb with a swooping, choirboy-in-an-echo-chamber vocal line packed with the long vowel sounds Lennox favors. The similarities don't stop in Prudhomme's throat; between Forever's droning intros, distressed breakbeats, and prickly calliope-style keyboards, it's fairly clear just who these guys owe much of their sound to.Lyrically, Forever concerns itself with a lot of minor communication breakdowns: ""never ever said the things that mattered,"" ""she didn't understand that I was having trouble in my head."" And, in keeping with the music's endlessly summery vibe, the rest is pleasantly half-baked: ""look at my hands and look at the air,"" ""when I see the light,"" ""I can't tell if I'm high or low."" What there's not, unfortunately, is any sense of urgency, anything lending these songs much in the way of consequence or fervor. That ""never said the things that mattered"" line (from ""Soft Hammer"", Forever's most unadulterated Beach Boys nod) seems especially telling. These songs may be well-crafted, busy without being overcluttered, built around strong—if not particularly distinctive—melodies. But, since Prudhomme and Donohue haven't quite yet figured out how to assert themselves above their fairly obvious influences, where personality's concerned, they're a little lacking.Between the carefully plotted reference points and the not-exactly-gripping lyrics, Forever tends to run together over the course of its 39-minute runtime. Still, taken song-for-song, there's no shortage of takeaways: the bouncy ""Not Really There"", the ambling Atlas Sound-alike ""Carousel"", the late-LP one-two of the brash ""Spinning Signs"" and the tender ""Sleepwalking."" Donohue and Prudhomme certainly know their way around a melody, and their careful craftsmanship puts them a notch or two ahead of the oft-slapdash box-ticking of a lot of easily led up-and-comers. But, if they hope to keep it going through the next cold snap, Painted Palms still need to figure out a way to bring a little more of themselves to the party."

Going for broke, their sophomore LP Forever transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright and emotionally charged.","In Stockholm, there is no scene. At least, there’s no scene like they have in Copenhagen, a community centered around the boutique Posh Isolation label started in 2009 by Christian Stadsgaard and Loke Rahbek. This is the label that launched a thousand Danish hardcore post-punk bands and their synth-noise side projects like Sexdrome, Damien Dubrovnik, Marching Church, Lust For Youth, Vår, Lower, and Iceage-- all of whom share at least one or more members between them. Andreas Lagerström,the lead singer and bassist for Holograms, said in an interview earlier this year, “we have nothing like that in Stockholm. We really like Iceage [and] Lower but most of us didn’t know about them when we started.” Though, he did admit to talking with Iceage on MySpace “like, five years ago when they were like thirteen or something.”So there’s Posh Isolation and then there’s real isolation like what the young Holograms have experienced after a grueling and bank-breaking 2012 world tour. Returning to their homes in the night-swept winter of Stockholm with no jobs, no money, and no real scene to speak of, their only lifelines were each other. Add in the only six or seven hours of sunlight that Stockholm was getting in the winter, the backdrop for the band’s sophomore album Forever starts to come into focus. Even for hyperborean punk, things were dark. Given the circumstances, and their precedent for synth-heavy dourness on their self-titled debut, it would be understandable for the band to turn in an exhausted and slapdash placeholder until conditions improved, or at least until two of the band members stretched their legs and formed a synth-noise side project. Instead, the factory-floor post-punk quartet doubled down on their sound and literally went for broke, taking their fear and desolation and sending it out to near arena heights.Lead single, the corporeal “Flesh And Bone” served as a bellwether as to where the band was heading, but it was just the tip. Its Peter Hook bass line and down-stroked eighth-note guitars lead the album much like they lead the song-- Now they have more in common with the sharpness of Joy Division or even the thickness of Editors, and creep further away from the electro-punk or hardcore-punk of their Danish doppelgangers. Most remarkable about Holograms is how they transform their pitch-black palate of sounds into something remarkably bright. Flying in the face of insular self-pity, they avoid all the trappings of isolation and turn it into 10 songs whose every syllable warrants a fist pump."

Since then, they've slimmed down to one member, Stefanie Franciotti, who returns with an upgraded full-length debut that plays like a shoegaze record for a generation reared on The NeverEnding Story.Franciotti's sound hinges on her dual interest in highly textured pop and errant noise. On the project's early tracks, those elements resulted in a sound that was aimless and a little soupy, if still pretty. Here, Franciotti is able to create a dynamic contrast by giving equal prominence to each, alternating between new wave-indebted slow-dance jams and experimental tracks that range in tone from sublimely ambient to jagged and far-out. This puts Franciotti in the company of Peaking Lights and Sun Araw, and while she's not as cosmically bent as either, she's making the same kind of escapist music that, at its best, can feel transportative.Ultimately, the album's song-oriented material is the most memorable. ""Romantic Streams"", ""Casual Diamond"", and highlight ""Stickers"" are peppered with space-age chimes and melting glissandos that feel grounded and organic. And despite all the machine noise, Franciotti's vocals feel approachable and human. Though her singing is sometimes unremarkable, at times sound like a slurry Hope Sandoval trapped in a bell jar (this is a compliment). At these moments, Forever's frozen lullabies provide mix immediate gratification with a hint of mystery."

Given the ever-shortening waiting period for nostalgia (hey, man, remember when the Patriots won the Super Bowl?) it's just a matter of time before the first ""hits of the 90s"" radio stations start popping up across the country. And when ""Seether"" starts rockin' the airwaves again, you better believe Verula Salt will be touring America's low-capacity venues, perhaps co-headlining with Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Jesus Jones.Nine years removed from their biggest hits, Cracker would seem to be state-fair circuit material themselves. Yet, to their credit, David Lowery & Co appear to be trying their hardest to avoid this fate and remain a vital, relevant act with their newest album, Forever. Of course, when your band's lasting image for most people is the lead singer boxing Sandra Bernhard, that's an uphill battle to be fighting.Cracker's secret weapon against obscurity, apparently, is to take refuge under the roots-rock banner, releasing Forever on the Virgin imprint Back Porch Records and wearing a whole lot of denim in the album art. While perhaps a further insult to hardcore Camper Van Beethoven fans desperately praying for Lowery to turn around his musical de-evolution, the choice at least reflects a purpose more thought out than, ""Hey, remember us? Please, please, please buy our new album!"" But roots-rock itself has always been something of a questionable cause, usually implying something along the lines of ""we're tired of experimenting; let's just make music that's already been made a thousand times before.""Save a few exceptions, that's mostly the vibe Forever projects, with the band (whittled down to a core of Lowery and guitarist Johnny Hickman) content to reside along a familiar country-rock-soul axis. You've got your acoustic guitar base, your occasional slide guitar fill, your Dylan-esque organ, your chug-a-lug drums, and your mildly catchy melodies. It would be offensive if it wasn't so obvious that Cracker doesn't aspire to much more than this rustic middle-America mediocrity act.Or do they? Mark Linkous returns the favor of Lowery co-writing the brilliant Sparklehorse anthem ""Sick of Goodbyes"" by producing the leadoff ""Brides of Neptune"" and tweaking Cracker's sound by throwing some eerie synth voices and a tinny drum loop into the mix. And while it's not quite Jim O'Rourke re-inventing Wilco, it is a compelling opening to the album. Hickman's lone solo composition, ""Superfan"", also augments the Cracker formula with an underlying drone and some ""Baba O'Riley"" violin, indicating that he's more than just Lowery's hired-gun soloist.But then again, experimentation also gives us ""What You're Missing"", a self-referential joke that painfully allows these Crackers to near-rap about their respective roles in the band. That sound you hear is Biggie rapidly spinning around in his oversized, solid-gold coffin. Humorous intention or no, can we please put a ban on white rock bands rapping?Elsewhere, Lowery's singing voice retains the same old one-dimensional, inflexible rasp which, given the uniformity of the music, works more often than not. Less successful are attempts to soften it with two-bit Sheryl Crow-ish harmony/backing vocals, which give ""Shine"" and ""Guarded by Monkeys"" a distastefully slick sheen. In fact, the album's overall polished countenance doesn't seem to jive with the band's supposed rootsy goals.So, no, Forever isn't the album that's going to rescue Cracker from the discount used bins and return them to radio prominence, but at the very least, it establishes them on the respectable side of the soon-to-be-oldies continuum: more our generation's Cheap Trick than our Doobie Brothers. And something tells me that's about all they're shooting for."

Over It. album since he turned 30, the kind of milestone that throws some songwriters into crisis. It seems like it would be an especially hard transition for a guy whose very band name telegraphs his obsession with ephemerality, but to judge by these songs he’s doing fine, more or less. It’s everybody else around him that isn’t doing so well. For instance, ""Open Casket,"" a eulogy to youth, begins the record with a visit to some of Weiss’s old hometown friends and finds them much worse for the wear. ""They wake up still uninspired with no regrets,"" Weiss sings, ""Hung over and divorced/ They torch their twenties like it’s kerosene.""Weiss has long been the spokesman for the emo revival, usually the most eloquent guy quoted in the ""Emo’s Back"" trend pieces that circulated a couple years ago. But now that the emo revival is looking less like a niche scene and more like the shape of alternative to come, Weiss is settling into a new role as the scene’s elder statesmen. He’s mellowed with age, and compared to the form-defying bands that have emerged since he first made his mark with the song-a-week project 52 Weeks in the late ’00s, he sounds downright classicist. Weiss can’t match the genre-dwarfing ambition of The World is a Beautiful Place..., the hyperventilating intensity of the Hotelier, or the youthful insouciance of Modern Baseball, and so he doesn’t try. Instead on Standards he banks on subtlety—which, really, is as good a way as any to distinguish yourself in a scene defined by overstatement.As usual, Weiss doesn’t disguise his influences. The album’s pattering tones and corked time signatures reaffirm that this is someone who’s been in a band with Mike Kinsella and could probably identify most of Polyvinyl’s classic releases by catalogue number. The influence that looms largest this time, however, is Death Cab For Cutie, and not just because Weiss leans more than ever on Ben Gibbard’s tender vocal affectations. As the band’s tightest, most approachable album, Standards feels like Into It. Over It.’s answer to Transatlanticism, a record that, while not quite a commercial crossover, feels like a trial run for one. Standards even has a mid-album slow-burner unabashedly modeled after Transatlanticism’s title track: ""Your Lasting Image,"" the achiest of Weiss's many ruminations about growing apart from the people he loved. When Weiss reaches the song’s climactic refrain ""I have the faintest recollection of us"" in concert you can almost imagine fans reflexively mouthing along ""I need you so much closer now"" by mistake."

In ...","There's something inherently non-anthemic about the type of music that's come to be known as ""post-rock."" In order for music to be considered anthemic, it has to work in big, sweeping gestures. Big, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies, powerful arrangements-- these are the things of American anthems. Up until now, most post-rock has featured none of these elements. The melodies-- when there are coherent melodies-- are usually sparse and minimalist, and far from hummable. Rhythms are complex and jerky, and difficult to tap out with only two feet. Vocals, which are rare, are generally languid; try to imagine Brian McMahan singing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" without lulling 10,000 grunting sports fans into a deep sleep.It seems remarkably appropriate that Tortoise, perhaps the most vital architects of the post-rock genre, would be responsible for its greatest advancement since its inception. Standards, the group's fourth full-length, takes their already adventurous sound into brave new terrain, exploring previously unknown dimensions of sonic depth and expressiveness. Not only is it the most acoustically enthralling album they've released, it's also without a doubt the most playful, dynamic, and anthemic post-rock album that has been released to date.I credit much of the increased fun factor on Standards to the more dominant role of guitarist Jeff Parker, whose work with Isotope 217 has proven that he's not only startlingly proficient, but also funny-- and funky. Though Parker's presence was a welcome addition to the band on TNT, he seems to have really come into his own as a band member on Standards, and his versatile guitar stylings not only breathe new life into Tortoise's sound, they also provide the kind of melodic centerpiece that previous recordings have at times lacked.But to give Parker the preponderance of the credit for the more playful, exploratory nature of Standards would be unfair; Standards is the sound of a whole band fully embracing their influences. Over the course of the album, one can hear echoes of such diverse sources as Miles Davis, Tom Zé, Jimi Hendrix, Philip Glass, Suicide, Brian Eno, Parliament, and spaghetti westerns and sci-fi flicks alike. But what makes this album truly impressive is the depth with which the five members of Tortoise approach the amalgamation of these complex sources. Rather than simply cutting and pasting superficial elements from a variety of genres, Standards sees the band truly reveling in the sounds of their influences. As the fucked up American flag on the record's cover suggests, Tortoise has taken this record as an opportunity to revisit an entire history of American music-- from jazz through dance and electronica-- and reshape it into an permutation of their own."

Following the release of their debut, 2018’s fortifying Sistahs, vocalist and guitarist Stephanie Phillips, bassist Estella Adeyeri, and drummer Chardine Taylor-Stone signed to Kill Rock Stars in an ideal alignment of the planets; the influential Washington label’s catalog of underground punk rock is a lodestar for Big Joanie’s sparse, fuzzed-out style and DIY ethos. On Back Home, their first LP for the label, the band expands its palette with electronics and strings while focusing its lyrics on gaining strength through vulnerability, making for some of the trio’s best songwriting to date.Back Home revolves around conceptions of home, whether in a domestic or psychological sense. The lilting ballad “Count to 10” loops tinkling Casio keys as Phillips sweetly weighs the pros and cons of nesting with someone: “I would like to come home with you/I know that you might be untrue,” she sings; “Take a chance/What else should I do?” On the grungy bruiser “Happier Still,” Phillips zeroes in on a way to get through the worst depressive episodes: “I feel happier/Happier/Happier still,” she repeats against pummeling power chords; “There’ll be no fear/No fear/No fear here.” The bellowed mantra grows increasingly invigorating as she wills herself toward peace of mind.Once again working with producer Margo Broom, Big Joanie have augmented their sound for bigger stages, accompanying muscular riffs with modulating synths and atmospheric instrumentation. On the late-album standout “I Will,” Phillips aims piercingly for the heart over an electronic organ: “You build a house, you build a roof, you build a happy home,” she chants, keeping pace with Adeyeri’s melodic bassline. “You make it bigger, make it stronger for another soul/And if it doesn’t make it better it’ll fill a hole.” The band circles around Phillips’ voice, evoking a similar slow-burning build to its stripped-back 2020 cover of Solange’s “Cranes in the Sky.” The stuttering “Sainted,” meanwhile, pulls from darkly alluring ’80s synth pop; the unsteady drum machine beneath Phillips’ voice patters like a nervous heartbeat, giving the song a delectably gothic tinge.Back Home’s lyrics are wry and loaded with self-reflection. “I always make the same mistakes/Don’t tell me I should learn from them,” chirp the backing vocals on the chugging “Taut.” The trio carries the same thread on “Today,” where swooning backing harmonies and violin (played by No Home’s Charlotte Valentine) bolster Phillips’ crooning, bittersweet appeals to know where she stands in a relationship. “Just let me know if I’m in the way,” she begs, lending further weight to an emotional haymaker.On the dreamy centerpiece “In My Arms,” Big Joanie reach an anthemic high. “I’ve compromised too many times in my life,” Phillips insists, surrounded by backing harmonies and surf-rock guitar, “One day I’ll make the great escape/And send another you away/But now I dream/Of only you in my arms.” On the song’s reprise, the group slows the song down to a crawl with a thudding, Ronettes-style backbeat and feedback-heavy guitar, cushioning each yearning word in echo. Back Home provides heart-rending moments alongside its punk grit, expanding on Big Joanie’s sound without loosening their bite.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

It’s a concept album whose concept is: What if Paris Hilton made an album?,"Picture it: You’re standing in the outdoor area of a bar, elbow-to-elbow with your fellow revelers. As it used to be, the proximity is perfectly safe. You aren’t even thinking about it. The temperature is perfect: 75 or 82 or 90, whatever you like. You’re having such a good time, you don’t even realize it—inoculated by the privilege of being able to take such things for granted. Whatever song is playing—you weren’t paying much attention to it—ends and the vague reggae intro of Paris Hilton’s Top 20 hit from 2006, “Stars Are Blind,” slinks on. Now you’re paying attention. The night’s sparkle brightens.The communal experience of a beloved pop song from yesteryear sounds so good right now. If you have any relationship with “Stars Are Blind,” the new vinyl reissue of Hilton’s first and, to date, only album might be the perfect serving of nostalgic comfort food. Go ahead and indulge: Pop music is a salve that can provide a respite from fixating on doom and even transcend the politics of its own creators. So, in the spirit of eating the rich—and looking back lovingly at any time other than the present—Paris is both an easy thing to tear into and a hard thing to deny. It is goofy and craven, ear candy and rotted commodity. It’s so simplistic that it could make you swear it’s a put-on, that it’s way savvier than it seems, that it’s so stridently bereft of having any there there that it must be intentional. “There,” Hilton mutters into your ears and smacks you over the head with maroon-and-blonde marbled vinyl containing an amalgamation of mid-aughts pop.At the time of its release, Paris seemed like a lark—a trifling vanity project from someone who was making a mint off of merely existing. Deadpan and clipped, Hilton didn’t seem even particularly engaged or enthusiastic about doing that. Already a tabloid staple, reality TV star, and absorber of paparazzi flashbulbs, Hilton was trying on pop stardom like a new pair of Louboutins that she’d soon discard. Little did we know that a reggae rip-off of Lord Creator’s 1970 cut “Kingston Town” would become the most enduring relic of her public reign. It couldn’t be anything else. It’s not like people are going to turn to her memoir Confessions of an Heiress, or one of her box-office bombs (The Hottie and the Nottie, anyone?), or DreamCatchers hair extensions to remember Hilton’s heyday by. For all the space Hilton sucked up and never gave anything of substance back to, “Stars Are Blind,” made it sort of worth it."

I was on the beach this weekend on a sunny day, and the air was still freezing. The local clam shack and ice cream stand had opened but the people in line were wearing windbreakers; this year's scoop girls are only just starting to build the biceps that they'll take to school next fall.It doesn't get hot enough in Portland, Oregon for music like this, and maybe that's why Chad Crouch and Blanket Music recorded Move in the South Pacific, on balmy Island 734-001 of the Bikini Atoll. They're joined by the beautiful voices of Esperanza Spalding (of Noise for Pretend) and Corrina Repp, who sound as smooth as ice against a hot torso. ""Shut up and sway your hips,"" they implore, and the tropical songs and warm recording couldn't sound more like an afternoon at a bar by the beach. They even put a cocktail umbrella in the spine of the disc, to illustrate what you're missing.Crouch says this is party music, and it is, though it's also good hangover music: soothing and free of shrill noise. The hooks are so subtle and laid-back that it can take a few listens to appreciate Crouch's catchy songwriting-- most notably on ""K - A - R - A [breathless] O - K [keep it coming] EEEeeeeeeeee,"" where his droopy-dog vocals and clever lyrics dance over a catchy guitar riff. Greg Lind's drumming is limber but restrained, and even the drum machine that augments the music is nicely integrated-- as on the hot jazz-meets-IDM ""Itchy Popcorn,"" which builds to speaker-shaking bass. Crouch is a low-key frontman with a thin, melodic voice, perfect for the tone of this record, and he and Ross Seligman play killer staccato lines on guitar.I'd expect American bossa nova to be as bad as other Americanized ethnic creations, like American ska, or American chop suey. In addition to having a stand-up band, Crouch succeeds by not pretending to be anything he isn't-- instead of posing as a smooth island loverboy, he sticks to wry lyrics and mundane topics. He has three jobs: as a musician, as a designer, and as the head of this label; and he likes to talk about the need to slow down. Like the 'to do' list that's set to a beautiful tune on ""Walk the Dog,"" or his potshots at hip visual artists in ""Hot Designers."" He writes witty love songs about (though not necessarily to) his ""incredible"" girlfriend, who he describes so sweetly in the liner notes that I winced hoping they haven't broken up since this came out. For example, the cutesy interplay in ""Tap the Beat"" (He: ""And if I lost my legs..."" She: ""I would put you on my back/ And I would grab things off the shelf for you""). Hey, guys, get a room!On a song like ""Costa Del Sol"" there's genuine yearning in Crouch's voice, the note of sincerity that makes it compelling and not just exotic. What does he yearn for? Maybe his girlfriend, though she probably hangs around plenty; maybe something as global as world peace, as on ""Get Togetha."" But more than anything, it sounds like Crouch wanted to vacation in a warm place and to party. And on the defrosting boardwalks, in the last gusts of New England's waning chill, that's good enough for me."

And it might.,"Stop me if this gets sappy. And it might. Because Selected Ambient Works 85-92—recently reissued by PIAS America—was the very first electronic music I ever bought, and certainly the first I ever heard over and over again. Long ago, before I was old enough to drive, I would sit in a small, cluttered bedroom in my parents’ suburban ranch house, absorbed for hours by the sounds contained on this disc. The creeping basslines, the constantly mutating drum patterns, the synth tones which moved with all the grace and fluidity of a professional dancer, the strange noises that I’d be unable to identify even if I tried. Back then, Aphex Twin was making music like nothing I’d ever heard before.What’s become apparent since is that I probably wasn’t the only one affected. After last year's disappointing Drukqs, it’s easy to forget that, back in the Warp Records heyday, Richard D. James was to this new breed of ambient and electronic music what Babe Ruth was to baseball. Sure, there were upstarts; µ-Ziq, Squarepusher, and Autechre were all on the scene by the time this collection hit shelves. But James was still the poster boy, the presumed ringmaster, single-handedly defining a style of music in the minds of many. Now, as a new wave of mostly twentysomethings step to the forefront of IDM, redefining electronic music for the third time in a decade, it becomes more and more obvious just how far reaching James’ influence was.There’s nothing new about this re-release, aside from improved availability and decreased cost. But then, improving on this package would be near impossible. Sure, the music on Selected Ambient Works 85-92 may sound a bit dated (as does, to be fair, most electronic music more than a few years old), but there’s no denying it was the defining statement of Warp’s early years, and the foundation for the careers of bands like Boards of Canada and Plaid.The songs here are not ambient in the same way as those on this disc’s sequel. Technically, most fall into Brian Eno’s broad definition of the style—it can be appreciated in small segments just as much as in its entirety. The music develops slowly, unafraid to linger on a particularly effective sound for as long as necessary—the creeping keyboard loop of “Schottkey 7th Path,” for example, is continually modified throughout the course of the song, but never once eliminated from the mix—but James would never be content as a mere follower in anyone’s footsteps. His work here serves a model for what would come to be known as traditional IDM. A simpler version of the style we’ve grown accustomed to, certainly, but IDM nonetheless."

Electric isn't quite electrifying in the way that Very and Introspective and ""What Have I Done To Deserve This?"" are, but nearly every track has a moment or two that ignites seemingly long-gone enthusiasm.Sometimes, that's because the Boys are using specific tricks that have worked for them before. ""Love Is a Bourgeois Construct"" is another in their string of modified classical pieces, taking its countermelody from Henry Purcell's King Arthur (by way of Michael Nyman's ""Chasing Sheep Is Best Left to Shepherds""), and its sour-grapes premise from a line in a David Lodge novel. And ""Thursday"" might have recalled 1986's ""Love Comes Quickly"" even without a synth-bass-and-bells introduction that makes it sound like that song's fraternal twin.The one thing Tennant and Lowe arguably do better than anyone else, though, is queering pop-- finding ways to recast seemingly sexuality-neutral musical ideas as specifically gay. ""Bolshy""-- slang for ""uncooperative"" or ""belligerent,"" roughly-- isn't ordinarily a gendered word, but it sure is in the song by that name here, and its connotation of Bolsheviks fits in with the Pet Shop Boys' fascination with all things early-Soviet. Electric's sole cover is a brilliant recontextualization: ""The Last to Die"" is a 2007 Bruce Springsteen song, whose chorus quotes John Kerry's 1971 condemnation of the Vietnam war. Tennant and Lowe scarcely change a word of its lyrics, but arranged and sung as a Pet Shop Boys song, it abruptly and unmistakably becomes a song about gay culture's transition from the AIDS crisis of the ""West End Girls"" era to its current focus on domesticity. That's quite a feat.In place of the leavetakings of their past few albums' final tracks, Electric ends with ""Vocal"", a fantasy of hearing exactly the kind of music you've always wanted to hear, in the perfect club. ""I like the singer/ He's lonely and strange/ Every track has a vocal,"" Tennant muses in his lonely, strange voice. It's a bit unusual to hear so many vocal tracks in a club these days, he knows, but he's imagining that his songs could save some kid the way other people's songs once saved him."

Following his over-long 2010 debut, this ""mini album"" of effortlessly gorgeous hip-hop ruminations offers a surprisingly cohesive statement.","L.A.-based artist Mtendere Mandowa has always stood out from the Brainfeeder pack of weirdo hip-hop producers: his beats are shrouded in dewy mist and subtropical condensation rather than the crunchy boom-bap of producers like Flying Lotus or Samiyam. The way he uses filters and closely clipped loops has the effect of a pleasantly smudged watercolor painting (much like those he designs himself), vague hints of otherwise implacable sounds rotating and repeating in a whimsical way. It's eminently accessible music, full of tiny ""eureka"" moments of subtle bliss, deft touches, and minuscule finishes so that even a two-minute sketch could feel like a whole world waiting to be dissected. Alas, it's probably that part of his sound that most works against Teebs: His debut album, Ardour, was probably one of the most pleasant things released from this particular sector last year, but it was easy for track after track of dense nature-scapes to blur together and to lose sight of Teebs' own fascinating personality in the grand scheme of faceless beauty.Part of the reason for that was Ardour's length-- at 18 tracks long, it was a hard album to digest without fatigue or boredom setting in, a record that could easily start to feel like style over substance. Whether it's a wise lesson learned or merely serendipity, Mandowa's quick successor is a 10-track, 30-minute affair and all the stronger for it. Collections 01, if you want to be nerdy about it, sits somewhere between an EP and a ""mini-album,"" but a surprisingly cohesive statement like this exists outside the need for nit-picky classification. Teebs himself describes Collections 01 as ""a side project or group of mine that just so happened to make the same exact music as I'm making now,"" and as bizarre a description as that is, given that the record features Rebekah Raff's harp and Brainfeeder-associated composer Austin Peralta, maybe it's justified.While the music on Collections is very identifiably Teebs, it's not merely 10 more tracks of Ardour. Whether it's the presence of collaborators with discrete roles, maturity, or merely a different headspace, the tracks here feel grounded and focused, with more to hold onto even at their most weightless.  The colorful, soft-focus smear is partly replaced with discrete space and  Take ""LSP"", with Peralta, a track that incorporates the same kind of meandering chimes and aquatic nature sounds as so many tracks on Ardour, but now it feels like every element has newfound purpose. On this record, dulcet keyboards paint silky melodies like brushstrokes, the drearily rustling beats are sewn into the fabric rather than tacked on, and tracks have real beginnings and endings rather than just floating by. Texturally, it's some of Mandowa's most gripping material yet, like the simultaneously slamming yet impossibly airy ""Pretty Polly"" or the queasily determined sub-basslines on closing duo ""Red Curbs Loop"" and ""Yellow More New"".It says something for the fleeting nature of Teebs' music that what, for most artists, would be a stop-gap release turns out to be an arresting career highlight. It might be a slight little package, but somehow it makes even more of an impact than its considerably larger sibling. Attractively structured, confident, and executed without the stoned daydreaming that defined Ardour, Collections marks a new high-water mark for a producer that was already eminently accessible. Even for those who aren't fans of the kind of rambling and tangential ADD music usually proffered by Brainfeeder, the little readjustment on Collections might be just enough to rope in former skeptics. Either way, his new record is another collection of effortlessly gorgeous ruminations on hip-hop expressed through thermal updrafts, babbling brooks, and cracking twigs: This time it just sounds like he knows his way around the forest a little better."

At this point, there's precious little he can share that we haven't already heard in a variety of forms.","Travis Stewart is a tireless musician, but his prodigious output is also his Achilles' heel. Pouring himself into the Machinedrum project has served Stewart well over the past five years or so, as he became one of Ninja Tune's best known and beloved artists on the back of 2013's memorable Vapor City LP. But his success has allowed him to inundate excitable fans with music, and Stewart is a poor self-editor. His Vapor City Archives record is the culmination of a year spent stretching an album cycle to its limits with a world tour, multiple EPs, an interactive website, a digital subscription service, and just about every other trick in the marketing book. So there's precious little he can share that we haven't already heard in a variety of forms.Though he's dabbled in hip-hop, IDM, and house, Machinedrum hasn't really switched up his sound since he discovered Chicago's fertile juke and footwork scene. Room(s) from 2011 was the first LP to fully manifest the style that has come to define Stewart's solo output—whiplash tempos, 808 drums, heavy bass, bright synths, and loads of Burial-like vocal samples. To this formula, Vapor City added acoustic guitar, Amen breaks, and the producer's own voice. Once a mercurial experimentalist, Machinedrum now refines what's already there, an approach certain electronic artists would do well to follow. So it's no surprise Vapor City Archives operates on that wavelength. But where the two previous albums were drawn from different sessions, this 10-song collection is culled from the same material as its namesake. The quality gives Archives a lingering sense of déjà vu; even if the tracks don't sound exactly like their Vapor City counterparts, they sure as hell remind you of them.To his credit, though, Machinedrum does fit a few updates into the tracklist. ""B Patient"", for example, juggles speaker-toasting bassweight and a cloud of emotive guitar and vocal figures with reinvigorated flair. Then there are the fizzy vocal hooks and dayglo pads of ""More Than Friends"", which make a great case for Stewart taking his breezy jungle/footwork concoction into the dance-pop realm. On the other hand, ""Hard 2 Be""'s choppy synth stabs and tumbling drum patterns are dead ringers for a handful of the hyped-up singles on Sepalcure, the eponymous 2011 album from Machinedrum's and Praveen Sharma's collaborative project. ""Vizion (Centered)"" is the most blatantly recycled of the bunch, a near facsimile of Vapor City's mid-album interlude in both name and mood. Flawlessly produced and unmistakable as it is, Vapor City Archives repurposes sounds and ideas from across Stewart's repertoire, setting up well-versed fans to trainspot similarities over any kind of immersive listening.If the abundance of music Machinedrum has put his name on in the past year is any indication, he could probably make these kinds of wistful, breaks-addled, post-dubstep/footwork/bass music hybrids while he files his taxes or cooks a nice dinner. Stewart's increased output and dearth of exploration gives Archives an unflattering offhandedness, and it also dilutes the potency of Vapor City, like putting together an album is just another item to mark off his to-do list."

Persona offers disaffection, sexuality, and outright ferocity in addition to the desolation she's offered to date.","Take a brief listen to any of the dusky tunes that Frederikke Hoffmeier has released as Puce Mary, and a startlingly bleak picture begins to form. Grating percussive scraping and nail-on-chalkboard vocalizations dominate her creeping compositions, even as her instrumental work runs the gamut from deafening drones to clattering industrial drum beats. It's a bitter and icy collection of short form pieces and collaborations when taken as a single entity, but her first LP Success didn't provide a compelling full-length exploration of that tenebrosity. With Persona, her new record for Posh Isolation, she's finally figured out how to present her strain of nauseating noise as a totemic, engaging whole.Just as friends and fellow members of Copenhagen's underground music scene like Lust for Youth, Lower, and Iceage continue to flirt with slicker production and pop structures on recent releases, Hoffmeier too has abandoned the universally bummed out aesthetic that's marked all of her efforts so far.  But rather than abandon the project's characteristic abstraction and abrasiveness, Hoffmeier uses Persona to diversify the moods that Puce Mary covers, offering disaffection, sexuality, and outright ferocity in addition to the desolation she's offered to date.""Courses"" relies on a blown out kick drum and the shrill trill of Hoffmeier's distorted vocals to offer a ferocious red herring to kick off the record. The outright terror and lurching subversions of industrial genre tropes rank it among the best in the mode that she's worked in most frequently. But where other noise records would offer little variations on that track's unhinged theme, Hoffmeier chooses to stagger in completely different directions for the rest of the record's six tracks, offering stark ambient pieces (""The Viewer""), squalling, sprawling noise jams (""Persona""), and the slow drone of the codeine-slurred ""Gesture"".It's a daring move to expand the project's thematic focus so drastically, and though it sticks the landing on the tracks that retain ties to the all-encompassing darkness Hoffmeier knows so well, Persona offers a handful of missteps too. Two of the album's longer pieces, ""The Viewer"" and ""Impure Fantasy"", rely a bit too heavily on vocal melodrama to underscore their sweeping instrumentals. In the former, Hoffmeier unleashes a string of phlegm-y coughs to punctuate a gradual synthesizer swell; the latter features distant sounds of spitting and rattling chains underpinning what would otherwise be a compelling spoken-word exploration of empowered sexuality. In each of these cases, a flair for theatricality undercuts tracks that were already unsettling enough on their own. But in taking the risks that spawned those blunders, Hoffmeier has managed to create a varied and rewarding record that's uniform in its gloominess."

And it might.,"Stop me if this gets sappy. And it might. Because Selected Ambient Works 85-92—recently reissued by PIAS America—was the very first electronic music I ever bought, and certainly the first I ever heard over and over again. Long ago, before I was old enough to drive, I would sit in a small, cluttered bedroom in my parents’ suburban ranch house, absorbed for hours by the sounds contained on this disc. The creeping basslines, the constantly mutating drum patterns, the synth tones which moved with all the grace and fluidity of a professional dancer, the strange noises that I’d be unable to identify even if I tried. Back then, Aphex Twin was making music like nothing I’d ever heard before.What’s become apparent since is that I probably wasn’t the only one affected. After last year's disappointing Drukqs, it’s easy to forget that, back in the Warp Records heyday, Richard D. James was to this new breed of ambient and electronic music what Babe Ruth was to baseball. Sure, there were upstarts; µ-Ziq, Squarepusher, and Autechre were all on the scene by the time this collection hit shelves. But James was still the poster boy, the presumed ringmaster, single-handedly defining a style of music in the minds of many. Now, as a new wave of mostly twentysomethings step to the forefront of IDM, redefining electronic music for the third time in a decade, it becomes more and more obvious just how far reaching James’ influence was.There’s nothing new about this re-release, aside from improved availability and decreased cost. But then, improving on this package would be near impossible. Sure, the music on Selected Ambient Works 85-92 may sound a bit dated (as does, to be fair, most electronic music more than a few years old), but there’s no denying it was the defining statement of Warp’s early years, and the foundation for the careers of bands like Boards of Canada and Plaid.The songs here are not ambient in the same way as those on this disc’s sequel. Technically, most fall into Brian Eno’s broad definition of the style—it can be appreciated in small segments just as much as in its entirety. The music develops slowly, unafraid to linger on a particularly effective sound for as long as necessary—the creeping keyboard loop of “Schottkey 7th Path,” for example, is continually modified throughout the course of the song, but never once eliminated from the mix—but James would never be content as a mere follower in anyone’s footsteps. His work here serves a model for what would come to be known as traditional IDM. A simpler version of the style we’ve grown accustomed to, certainly, but IDM nonetheless."

On his debut album, Live Forever, Bartees Strange pays slight homage to his past with “Mustang,” with that feeling of needing to flee your hometown—cosmic synths, a hook yelped with scrunched eyelids, an outro that drives like a Charger on a clear highway. It’s a paradox that Bartees can’t escape whiteness in the music he creates as a Black man. It’s already part of whatever artistic turn Bartees makes, whether it’s the erasure of Black artists' contributions to indie rock, or the existential crisis Black rappers face when they must entertain largely white crowds. It’s a lot to work through on a 35-minute album, which is just a part of what makes this one of the most fascinating and affecting debuts of the year.Most of Live Forever’s magic, however, is in how it doesn't seek to explicitly subvert whiteness. Bartees is not necessarily a boundary-breaker: He presents every bit of sound he collects as a natural part of his experience. From a childhood spent bouncing from base to base as an Army brat or shying away from becoming the frontman in the bands he shuffled through as an adult, the struggle to root his voice is a running theme. Yet every influence he pulls from—TV on the Radio’s world-weary poetry, Hot 100 hip-hop cadence, industrial punk—is marked by his personable, intimate presence. “Mustang” flexes its biceps, but doesn’t lose its humanity (“Last night I got so fucked up, near lost my job/It’s nice to think that folks are near, waking up was hard this year”). For all its arena-sized gesturing, the song is really a heart-to-heart.Bartees’ introduction to the wider public was directly informed by his otherness. His breakthrough—March’s Say Goodbye to Pretty Boy, an EP of National covers—was inspired by being the only person of color at one of the band’s concerts in Washington D.C. Bartees’ interpretation of “Lemonworld”—which flips singer Matt Berninger’s sullen brokenness to a world-beating howl—speaks to the cathartic mode he sticks to for much of the album’s first half. The run is a pristine technicolor whir, where the seasick horns of “In a Cab” swing briskly into “Stone Meadows,” whose harmonic guitar interplay and bleak melodrama (“If I died in a meadow/If I died I don’t think they’d ever find me at all”) recall Silent Alarm-era Bloc Party. But the thrills mainly sprout from Bartees’ powerfully layered vocal performances."

He simulated masturbation, shattered car windows with crowbars, and unleashed the primal screams expected from a man who owned publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue. Then he turned into a black panther. The video ends with Bart Simpson striking a B-Boy pose in a Michael Jackson shirt, and ordering Homer to “chill out, homeboy.” It shattered all previous viewing records on Fox.The $4 million, 11-minute unedited telecast of “Black or White” ranks among the Smithsonian-worthy artifacts of ’90s pop monoculture—up there with Nirvana trashing their instruments at the ’92 VMAs, the premiere of “Summertime” after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Hillary Clinton hitting the Macarena at the ’96 DNC. No one ever had more juice than Jackson did at the time, and it’s difficult to imagine that anyone ever will again.This was right around the time when they named him an official king of the Ivory Coast. In Gabon, 100,000 greeted him with signs reading “Welcome Home, Michael.” His universal popularity was on par with pizza and the polio vaccine. Safe enough to be Captain EO at Disneyland, hood-certified enough to throw up the set with the Crips.The 33-year-old had recently signed the most lucrative contract in recording history, worth hundreds of millions, giving him his own label and the highest royalty rate in the industry. What’s more, no one thought it was out of line for someone who had sold close to 70 million records in the previous decade. In the press, Sony claimed the deal would reap them billions.So when he released the first single from Dangerous, his first album in four years, fanatical interest led MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox to televise it at the same time—offering the greatest strategic victory since the Berlin Wall tumbled two years prior. And even though Jackson technically didn’t cause the collapse of East German Communism, his star wattage was so supreme that the Stasi secret police spied on him during his 1988 Berlin concert, fearing that obsessive MJ fans would accomplish what Reagan couldn’t.With “Black or White,” Jackson lashed out at his public perception. In the interim since 1987’s Bad, he’d grappled with both outlandish rumors (buying the Elephant Man’s bones, sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber) and some that drew blood (allegations of bleaching his skin). The innocent popcorn-eating Michael of Thriller was gone, but calling him “Wacko Jacko” was slander. He wanted us to know he was a man, an eccentric sure, but an adult with deeply rooted beliefs."

G. Cook production, the PC Music star’s first full-length can’t help feeling a little anticlimactic.","Hannah Diamond’s “Pink and Blue” still sounds bizarre and striking: like a record Hey Arnold!’s Helga Pataki would make with chintzy synth plugins and one day of voice lessons. The track helped catapult PC Music, the collective Diamond and producers A. G. Cook and Danny L Harle belonged to, from SoundCloud oddity to sonic architects for the mainstream: Carly Rae Jepsen, David Guetta, Madonna. But while the producers have become big names (by producer standards), besides early collaborator SOPHIE the vocalists largely have not. Part of that’s how you define success; Diamond’s had her own breakthrough as a visual designer, collaborating with artists like Offset and Years & Years’ Olly Alexander. Part of it’s that PC Music’s vocalists present themselves less as singer-songwriters—as real people—than high concepts. (An early headline: “Hannah Diamond Is Real.”)More simply, “Pink and Blue” came out in 2013 and now it is 2019. And while Diamond’s cohort have expanded their sound—to the apocalyptic scope of OIL OF EVERY PEARL’s UN-INSIDES, the New Age soaring of Caroline Polachek’s Pang, or Charli XCX’s bangers-as-an-ethos Pop 2—Diamond’s new album Reflections pretty much still sounds like 2013. That’s because it’s not far removed: Reflections was meant to be a 2016 EP, and over the past decade, most of the tracks have been released piecemeal via mixes and one-offs. If you hate PC Music, you will continue to; if you love them, Reflections will not change that.But producer A. G. Cook’s done a lot since 2013, so inevitably, these tracks register less as individual Cook songs than as types of Cook song. There are the ones derived from trance, like “True,” which is like trying to recreate a Sash! song in a MIDI sequencer stuck on a slow BPM. There are the ones that emulate video games, like “Fade Away,” which might as well be an arrangement of the star maze music from Super Mario Land 2. There are the ones, like “Shy,” that sound like the Jock Jams that sound like “Party Rock Anthem.” “Never Again” sounds as if Cook, who recently became Charli XCX’s creative director, were so inspired by her True Romance song “Take My Hand” that he decided to remake it on a music box. (It also has vinyl crackles, which on a Hannah Diamond record are like taking a face-bedazzling app and making the icon a skeuomorphistic wardrobe.)"

First there was the cheesy popcraft of Julian, then came the cutesy annoyance that was Sean, and now, out of nowhere, comes a third Lennon brat convinced he possesses some shred of his father's musical talent. But no, this is not an as-yet-unheard-from member of the Lennon brood: Don Lennon is a longtime Beantown scenester with not a trace of Liverpudlian blood in him, but who still seems to have inherited much of John's sardonic wit. Though his songs can be scathing, Don Lennon's gift is in the ambiguity, subtlety, and irony with which he handles his subjects.And the subjects covered on Downtown include Lenny Kravitz, Kramer, John Cale, the Boston music scene, gay nightlife, and Dave Matthews-- who enthralls Lennon enough to devote two songs to the ice cream-hawking huckster. On opener ""Really Dave Matthews,"" Lennon sings about gaining acceptance by pretending to be a Matthews fan, and it's both funny and a little sad. On ""Matthews Comes Alive,"" Lennon assumes the role of Dave himself, recounting the band's rise to stardom, from the first nervous gig to playing at the ""Earth Day festival"" to a level of ubiquity where songs start appearing at ""cookouts on Cape Cod"" and at ""Chili's Bar and Grill."" It's scathing without being heavy-handed. After all, the best put-downs are those the person you're putting down only half gets.""Lenny Kravitz and Lisbon"" warns of oversized Lenny concert posters threatening the city, and in a roundabout way, satirizes the false love touring artists show the places they visit. ""Gay Fun"" is the kind of song that, in lesser hands, might be considered offensive or simply trite, but it's good-natured fun for Lennon. The ballads ""Mekons Come to Town"" and ""The Night Kramer Met Anne"" cheekily spin yarns of indie rock icons with overwrought arrangements and the aching sincerity in Lennon's voice.Musically, Downtown sounds a little like Belle & Sebastian fronted by Bruce McCulloch from ""Kids in the Hall."" The arrangements are jazzy, light, breezy-- some have a West Coast country rock vibe, while others have a certain baroque touch. Strings, horns, keyboards, and sax (courtesy of Morphine's Dane Colley) make the album varied without sounding forcibly eclectic or random. But the main ingredient holding everything together is Lennon's detached delivery and wide-eyed romanticism-- a formula highly reminiscent of fellow Bostonian Jonathan Richman.""John Cale"" ends the album on beautiful note, with soaring strings and Lennon's most accomplished vocal moment. Richman's influence is heavily apparent as Lennon sings lyrics like, ""Fucked up on heroin and speed-- in the back of someone's car-- saying all these nasty things about Lou Reed,"" and still somehow make it sound like the theme to a children's television show.It's in this way-- through ambiguity and by not laying all his cards on the table all at once-- that Lennon manages to take a bundle of humorous observations about pop culture figures and raise it above a simple collection of cheap laughs. As long as he doesn't get sued and cave in to cynicism, Don should be the musical Lennon to watch-- even if he never gets to date a member of Cibo Matto."

They dress like spangley futuristic mime robots, which I suppose is sort of annoying, but that really doesn't have anything to do with their music. They bankrupted their record label and waited way too long to put their first album out, but again, all that stuff is strictly extra-musical. They actively and knowingly marketed themselves as electroclash, but Fischerspooner has much more in common musically with the Scissor Sisters than Miss Kittin or A.R.E. Weapons. They've never managed to make anything as great as their first single, but then ""Emerge"" was such a dizzy, searing monster jam that it'd be hopeless to hold any group to that standard forever.So the only real reason I can think of to hate Fisherspooner is the vwerdle-vwerdle-vwerdle oscillating synth-bass sound they use on every single song. This can grow tired after an entire album, but it's a good, malleable sound, as effective on breathy, luxuriant opium-disco tunes like ""A Cloud"" as on swooping, lazy filter-Fleetwood-Mac tracks like ""Happy"". And plus you can ratchet up the pitch a bunch on the chorus and the song will automatically sounds way more intense.On Odyssey, the group piles on huge, clattering drums, mournful house pianos, deliriously sleazy strutting white-funk guitars. The album's production is clean enough to sterilize needles; everything has a lavish, glossy cocaine sheen. The group has recruited help from pop-music pros like Mirwais (who produced Madonna's ""Music"", which is fucking awesome) and Linda Perry (who wrote Pink's ""Get This Party Started"", which is fucking awesome). They got the now deceased Susan Sontag to write the lyrics for ""We Need a War"", which is nice, but it's not like anyone ever listens to the lyrics on Fischerspooner songs.Odyssey is Fischerspooner's attempt at kicking and screaming their way out of punchline hell, so it's a bit of a surprise how good everything sounds. The deluxe, swirley disco tracks that begin the album slide nicely into the brittle new-wave funk and imperiously sighed synthed ballads. All of this builds beautifully to the group's cover of the Boredoms' smeary psychedelic symphony ""Circle"". It's something of a shock hearing the Boredoms' messy drum-circle monolith translated through Fischerspooner's glammy synths, but the group approaches the song with the majestic fervor it demands, and the result is a truly gorgeous pileup.Odyssey isn't a great album: Many of the vocal hooks are weak and underfed, the group never finds the widescreen abandon of ""Emerge"", and there's that synth burble on every song. But the group has managed to come up with an appealingly grand, ridiculous epic, more than anyone could reasonably expect from these forgotten freaks. So find some other band to hate. May I suggest Kings of Leon?"

He was last seen in an East Village dive bar, martini in one hand, rhyming dictionary in the other. Can't really blame him for keeping a low profile, though; after dropping an epic achievement like 69 Love Songs on the unsuspecting public, you'd take a break, too. While the Magnetic Fields have been recently plucked out of the draft by superlabel-in-the-making Nonesuch, Merritt's yet to release a follow-up under his highest-profile name, choosing instead to focus on scoring films, farewell live performances of 69, and writing a musical with stock accordionist and children's author Daniel Handler.Oh yeah, and also releasing another collaboration with Christopher Ewan under the sacrilicious nom de plume of Future Bible Heroes. Like the Heroes' last full-length, 1997's Memories of Love, Eternal Youth has Ewan electronically arranging songs co-written with Merritt, with vocals added by Magnetic Fields drummer/occasional singer Claudia Gonson. And also like its predecessor, Eternal Youth feels like more of a lackluster stopgap than equal-footing sidecar for Merritt's songcraft, a frustrating teaser from the Merritt portfolio of aliases.Part of the problem seems to lie with Ewan's arrangements, electro-pop that no doubt endears him to the equally 80s-fixated Merritt. While Merritt's electronic backings often sound like dancefloor anthems for the club inside his head, Ewan's slicker touch has the tendency to present the songs like actual club anthems, losing a lot of the intimacy of the Magnetic Fields' productions. Fair enough, but perhaps not the wisest of approaches given Merritt's flair for clever wordiness, Tin Pan Alley-style melodicism, and Gonson's voice.Gonson's occasional microphone duties on 69 Love Songs were a treat, as Merritt's songs tend to sound good delivered by the opposite gender. But as the sole vocalist on Eternal Youth (Merritt's Cash-ian baritone sits this one out), the pleasure of her slightly disinterested, sorta flat tone wears before long. Irony being dead and all (or so I'm told), the detached vocal is an endangered species, and Gonson's throws a warm blanket over the romantics of ""No River"", dampens space oddity ""Doris Day the Earth Stood Still"", and creates the wrong kind of bedroom voice on the smooth-operating ""A Thousand Lovers in a Day"".Merritt, meanwhile, remembers to bring his usual lyrical tricks (""I'd rather be a queen when the rooks take wing than be losing your affection,"" for instance), but seems to use a lot of his C-list melodies. For a Next Wave of Song-certified man known for penning instant-timeless melodies, it's disappointing to sit through stiffs like ""Find an Open Window"" or ""Kiss Me Only With Your Eyes"" that don't even come close to taking a spot on one's in-head playlist. ""I'm a Vampire"" is pristine danceable camp and ""From a Dying Star"" is a catchy/haunting continuation of the extraterrestrial theme, but on most of these tracks, Merritt sounds too much like he's phoning it in; ""The World is a Disco Ball"" could be a Magnetic Fields sendup on some forthcoming collection of indie rock interpretations by Weird Al (for which working titles would certainly include No Al-Ternative, My Bloody Alentine and Al's Tomorrow Parties).So the spotlight's on Ewan, who fills Eternal Youth with serviceably average synthetic-pop dioramas. The album is weighed down with sub-minute interlude filler, some of which (i.e. the almost-Timbaland-style skittery-strings of ""Viennese Lift"") are more interesting than the full-length backdrops, but which still kill what turtle-ish momentum the song cycle manages to establish. From the evidence presented on Eternal Youth, Ewan sounds mostly like the bad influence kid-next-door to Merritt, pushing him back from the slightly more organic sound of recent fare towards his (weaker) bleached-out keyboard symphony/guest vocalist early days. Maybe he's just taking some practice laps before turning on the Magnetic Field generator again, but regardless, non-completists are better off waiting for the real deal."

But after a decade of grinding—selling records, T-shirts, and mobile phone service—the 34-year-old producer and MC can afford better gear. And though his fourth LP proves he’s upgraded his equipment since his school days, Grime MC stays faithful to the history of London’s grime scene.Grime MCs might rap, but heads will be quick to tell you that grime is separate from hip-hop. The genre traces its roots to the UK garage scene, where parties are focused on the floor, not the stage. Jme has been there almost since the beginning—the first Boy Better Know mixtape dropped just a few years after Wiley’s genre-founding “Eskimo” riddim. And the sounds of Grime MC, particularly the beats Jme made himself (“96 of My Life,” “Badman Walking Through,” “Brothers & Sisters”), are in the same vein as those early tracks: Booming bass, vintage drum machines, and sinister synths. While Stormzy and Boy Better Know co-founder Skepta (who’s also Jme’s older brother) flirt with more commercial sounds that have raised the scene’s profile, Jme has remained steadfast. With rowdy beats and BPMs that hover above 140, Grime MC is made for the dancefloor and steeped in the slang and Caribbean patois that permeates London’s underground.Yet for a classicist, Jme appears to defy stereotype. He’s an OG who roots for the kids making UK drill, a vegan teetotaling street rapper, and video game obsessive who produces beats live on Twitch. He’s internet-savvy, but if you want to hear his new record, it’s only available for purchase only on CD or vinyl—no downloads, no streaming platforms. This oppositional stance to current industry norms doesn’t reflect an unwillingness to adapt to modern technology. Rather, Jme understands the flattening effect of DSPs, where Adele lives next to Stormzy who shares playlists with Beyoncé. Grime has always been a subculture, rooted in meatspace. By forcing fans to buy the record direct or from local shops, he puts the onus on the listener to seek him out. And it seems to have worked: Grime MC debuted at No. 26 on the UK Top 40 Albums chart. Weeks after its release, it’s sold out pretty much everywhere.Opting out of the largest and fastest-growing part of the music industry certainly limits Grime MC’s potential ceiling, which is as good an indication of Jme’s goals as anything else. Having watched fellow MCs fall victim to aspirational greed, he rejects the emptiness of excess with the understanding that you can’t take it with you. “When I pass, I’m leaving a lot/Even my own skin has to stay and rot,” he raps on “How Much.” These aren’t the words of a man upset that a lesser talent has climbed higher, but of a man who’s counted his blessings."

It’s a refreshingly candid self-assessment.,"On February 12 last year, it felt like slowthai’s world was falling apart. The Northampton rapper had toasted a raft of nominations at the NME Awards and picked up a bird-flipping trophy as “Hero of the Year.” But a bad joke taken too far meant the night ended in disaster. His lewd interactions with the show’s host, comedian Katherine Ryan, and a later altercation with a member of the audience—after which slowthai was escorted from the venue—made for grim viewing as video clips circulated online, stripped of context. The condemnation that followed was widespread and immediate, his career hoisted onto a pyre erected by furious social media users. As hangovers go, the one he woke up to the next day would be monumental. He issued an apology and received vocal support from Ryan. He returned the “Hero” award, asking that it be forwarded to her. She reminded him that “a bad day on social media passes so quickly.” But a year in lockdown offers plenty of time to sit with your thoughts. Though the February 12 release date is a coincidence—pandemic-induced delays pushed it back by a week—it’s hard not to see some significance in TYRON arriving exactly a year to the day since slowthai’s reckoning.While slowthai’s debut, Nothing Great About Britain, had focused his punkish energy and confirmed him as a righteous voice for a forgotten generation, his gaze turns inward on TYRON, adopting his lyric book as a diary once again. The album is split into two halves of seven tracks each: the first half spelled out in caps lock, with all its implied yelling, and the lower-case second half providing softer moments, with a bed of pop samples and gentle guitar licks beneath slowthai’s spittle-flecked reflections. Four of these second-half tracks were recorded in 2019 and the first months of 2020, while the bulk of the first half was recorded after the disastrous awards show, and the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic.As repudiations of so-called cancel culture go, “CANCELLED,” featuring Skepta, is among the more ham-fisted. While slowthai at least injects a bit of humor with tongue-in-cheek rhymes of “Harry Potter,” “lobster,” and “vodka,” Skepta’s rigid, boastful chorus (“How you gonna cancel me?/Twenty awards on the mantlepiece/Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury”) only emphasizes the joys of the mute button. “VEX,” “WOT,” and “DEAD,” on the other hand, beg for repeat plays. Here, slowthai is at his cocksure best, weaving around the beat as if it were there for his amusement only. He snarls back at the baying crowd over Kwes Darko’s zappy instrumentals with the same mischievous vim that made early tracks like “T N Biscuits” so inviting."

I care about you ...","I'm not going to lie to you, kids, and I want you to know that. I care about you. (Well, most of you.) So I'll be honest. Rock isn't always pretty, but sometimes that's just the way it's gotta be. Believe me, then, when I say that Rye Coalition's new album, On Top, is downright ugly, but rocks like it's about to go out of style. So all of you who just want another pretty face can stick to the safety of The Strokes and Weezer. In the meantime, Rye Coalition is gonna be busy defining arena-ready indie rock without any pretty-boy theatrics, so get out of the way or be crushed underfoot.On Top is so relentlessly energetic that from the moment Rye Coalition begins to stomp and bruise their way through the album, no one stands a chance. Once they get moving, all you can do is be dragged through the mud behind them. By the time the album ends, you're filthy, the wind has been knocked out of you and your organs hurt from the impact, but, like Loverboy, you've loved every minute of it. The only 'break' to be found is on the bluesy ""Freshly Frankness,"" which wouldn't exactly sound out of place on White Blood Cells-- if, uh, Jack White took steroids.But before I forget, the lyrics suck big time. If they're tongue-in-cheek, Ralph Cuseglio's delivery is too straight-faced to let on. Don't worry too much, though, since lyrics only matter if you can understand them-- which in this case you can't. (Just don't open the liners and you'll be fine.) Cuseglio spits and froths his way through every song with such manic adrenaline that he must be hooked to some kind of goddamn rock and roll I.V. And for their part, the rest of the band matches him, with jagged guitar lines dominating and kicking like a gas-powered mule (you heard me). On the rare occasions when Justin Morrey's bass is able to bust through the mix, I can hear Shellac-- and I probably don't need to tell you, but that's a good thing.Now, this is a pretty straightforward album, so the possibilities do exhaust themselves somewhat by the end; there's only so much that can be done with this sort of visceral, no-frills rock. But just as doubts regarding this album's staying power creep in, the showpiece closer, ""Honky, Please,"" shatters them Conan-style. The track is immediately set apart by the awkward opening sounds of seagulls and a garbage truck in reverse gear, before it launches into a menacing guitar riff. The instrumentation builds, collapses under its own weight, then resurges with such a massively gut-wrenching crescendo that nothing can follow it. So nothing does.Rye Coalition may not be what anyone had in mind when rock and roll was developed, but that's only because they weren't thinking hard enough. Did I mention the record was engineered by Steve Albini? If you don't take my word for it, at least trust Steve not to steer you wrong. Steve says, ""On Top is a juggernaut of an album."" Believe it, kids."

He wrote about these creatures in prose that is defamiliarized, exhausting, wickedly funny. The Russian composer Ekaterina Shilonosova, who performs as Kate NV, shares a similar sensibility with the Austro-Hungarian writer: On her excellent fourth record, WOW, there is a suite of animals, and she is both rigorous and whimsical about them. On WOW, NV abandons the slightly more legible songs of 2020’s Room for the Moon, and the cohesiveness of 2018’s для FOR, opting instead for delightfully fractured inscrutability. WOW is dense and hyper-saturated with chintzy synths, field recordings, and heavily manipulated vocals. Call it maximalism; call it pop music for people who happen to enjoy both Karlheinz Stockhausen and Lisa Frank. It exists in a zone that NV has been working in for a while, one that involves fermenting and reimagining everything from Japanese city pop to the ECM New Series to corny ’80s chart-toppers. Opener “oni (they),” which features Japanese-language lyrics written by Foodman, feels like being inside a pinball machine: Each flicker of synth lights up brilliantly, bouncing erratically from point A to B. Each song is its own absurd room. Like previous records, WOW makes good use of Found Sound Nation’s Broken Orchestra sample pack, sourced from damaged instruments from Philadelphia’s public schools. On “confessions at the dinner table,” there are synths that sound like they’re giggling or yawning, field recordings of a door opening, the sound of clinking dishes. Violin and clarinet burst in at the midpoint. It is like a food fight, rendered in the aesthetics of Věra Chytilová’s Daisies, where two girls in flower crowns stomp around on a table drinking brandy and throwing cake at each other, fucking with everyone they meet. But NV’s music isn’t twee. Just because something is cute doesn’t mean it’s not rigorous, and her playfulness has a purpose: In upsetting expectations, it’s meant to keep you on your toes. Her songs are slanted, oblique. “razmishlenie (thinking)” builds in such a way that you’d think it would eventually depressurize, yet it does not; it stays at the same level of intensity for the song’s duration. There’s no payoff, but not in a way that is necessarily disappointing. Her music can be a workout; its self-containment can be almost alienating.Perhaps that’s because there’s not necessarily a narrative. You couldn’t say that WOW is about anything. Instead, it’s defined by its aesthetic cohesion, a beautiful sense of formal seriousness that holds court over the record’s surrealistic menagerie.  All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

To some, the 24-year-old is simply a famous ex-boyfriend, an inescapable figure in the culture surrounding the Instagram-based rumor mill The Shade Room, which has closely documented his messy and complicated relationship with the IG-famous influencer Ari Fletcher (he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery earlier this year). At this point, I’m sure VH1’s Love & Hip-Hop would write Herb a blank check to let cameras into his life. But G Herbo doesn’t need reality television—at least, not right now—because he also happens to be a rapper that has helped shape the last decade of hip-hop.In 2012, a 16-year-old Herb released “Kill Shit” alongside Lil Bibby, a breathless marathon about trauma, pain, and Chicago life that helped lay the foundation for drill, arguably rap’s premier subgenre of the 2010s. By the time Herb was 18 years old, he had a classic Chicago mixtape and multiple street-level hits—his 2012 single “Gangway” has become timeless, so much so that Lil Uzi Vert flipped it into his comeback track “Free Uzi” last year. If Herb didn’t release another song past his teenage years, his legacy would remain, but his transition into the major-label rap cycle has been seamless.PTSD, G Herbo’s latest album, is proof that of his two lives, his rap half still takes precedent. Over glossier, high-budget production than usual and alongside a handful of rap’s biggest names, PTSD stays true to Herb’s core: first-hand tales of living with trauma and paranoia and failing to overcome that trauma and paranoia with drugs and success. He tells his stories in a fiery, deep voice, emphasized by a chilling album cover, which replaces the American flag’s 50 stars with faces of friends that he’s lost.From the Don Cannon-produced intro, which samples JAY-Z’s classic (and basement freestyle standard) intro to The Dynasty, Herb learns that the hardest battle is with himself. “Ain’t no lil bitty pill just gon’ heal a man/He can’t chill, he need a pill, guess he too militant/Oh, you just like us, they robbed you of your innocence, huh?” he raps, in a rapid-fire delivery that could be air-dropped into ’00s Harlem. Listening to Herb on the intro (and for much of the album) is like watching him argue with a therapist through a crack in the door.But Herb’s stories come to life when he has a partner to bounce off of. On “Party in Heaven,” alongside fellow former drill staple Lil Durk, the pair reflect over a beat chilly enough for a Drake time-and-location track. On “Lawyer Fees,” his rapping is so passionate he begins to swerve offbeat, interrupted only by Polo G’s grim hook: “Demons in my head, and I trip every time them voices speak.” Eeriest of all is the Juice WRLD-assisted “PTSD”: “I made it on my own, they said I’d be in jail or dead/I’ve seen my brothers fall over and over again/Don’t stand too close to me, I got PTSD,” wails Juice. It’s a bleak song made even more so by Juice WRLD’s recent death, but there’s still a world where you can imagine it being catchy enough to fit within Hot 97’s daily rotation.PTSD’s missteps arrive when the album jettisons Herb’s rawness and begins to feel like any other album with access to major-label pockets. “Shooter” doesn’t sound like a G Herbo song; it’s like a record executive pieced together his vocals and tacked on a Jacquees chorus without Herb’s knowledge. The same could be said for the BJ the Chicago Kid-featuring “Gangstas Cry,” which is sappy, a tone Herb normally avoids.“Feelings” feels like the unification of Herb’s two worlds. He balances his demons (“I got diagnosed but I don’t want no crazy pills,” he admits) with reflections on his highly publicized relationship. “Talked to my kid mom today, that was kinda hard/Sick of all the drama in my life, we ain’t gotta start,” says Herb. It’s the type of honest and thoughtful song that directly connects PTSD to his early raps like “Kill Shit,” as Herb refuses to become yet another artist known more for headlines than their music."

The young wordsmith, also known as Santan Dave, would stare into the camera and relay fierce reflections about his tumultuous life, using them as a lyrical crowbar to pry open the doors keeping voiceless Londoners in the dark. On “Thiago Silva” he proved he could hold his own at a grime tempo, and fans soon discovered he played the piano, too. It was difficult to fathom that he was only a teenager. Now Dave is 20, and his debut album, Psychodrama, is one of the most significant bodies of British rap music in a generation.Psychodrama is a form of psychotherapy in which patients role-play events from their past to heal and make sense of themselves. Dave uses the term as a cathartic glue to bind heavy themes together, bringing listeners into his therapy room while he grapples with societal injustice, industry contradictions, and private pain. The album starts and finishes with songs “Psycho” and “Drama,” respectively, and the latter includes a touching dialogue with his older brother, who is serving a life sentence in prison. This haunting backdrop has long bled into Dave’s lyricism—“Never had a father and I needed you to be the figure,” he cries in the album’s closing passage—but its impact is more closely examined across Psychodrama than ever before. Over 11 songs and much hypnotic piano playing, Dave sets his conceptual limits, and then fills them with an urban opera that blends his desire to exorcize demons with old-soul musical wisdom and youthful performativity.When the single “Black” was debuted on BBC Radio 1 as Annie Mac’s Hottest Record in the World, it garnered backlash from listeners who missed its nuanced critique of language as a limiting construct on racial identity, expression, and diversity. But the song—on which Dave shares his piano bench with acclaimed producer Fraser T. Smith, whose influence can be heard throughout the album—is not just a proud race anthem. As political and media establishments in Britain continue to fall short in representing ethnic minority experiences (in one recent case, a centrist politician found herself unable to avoid even a basic faux pas), “Black” doubles as a manifesto for responsible phraseology, and against anachronistic stereotyping. “A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news/And if he’s white, you give him a chance, he’s ill and confused/If he’s black he’s probably armed, you see him and shoot,” Dave assesses."

The number 23, heralded by many an occultist and rag-tag philosopher is often considered a magical number associated with change, the point in a series where new energy comes in to transform the pre-existing condition and change the trajectory. A pop example of these esoteric notions, sadly, may be beloved New York indie rockers Blonde Redhead's seventh full-length, 23.Ironically, this career-facelift will most likely be the album that catapults this band to the red carpet-- more record sales, more exposure, higher profile tours. But serious Redhead heads familiar with the band's past forward-thinking oeuvre of magical melancholy will most likely catch a wince-able whiff of disintegration. Somewhere underneath all the high-gloss, ornamental swirlies and lacquered doilies are haphazardly camouflaged well-written songs.Essentially, 23 consists of simply tunes much in the vein of the international trio's high water mark, 2000's Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons, which found the once angularly screeching Sonic Youth/Unwound-worshiping post-no-wavers breathing deep and relaxing. The songs are similar to 2004's almost as good Misery Is a Butterfly, which took said gems of art-pop blueness, but draped them in heavy orchestration and flirted with an almost too-lush production. Consider Butterfly the unsubtle foreshadowing: Allegedly, somewhere during the course of the making of the self-produced 23, Blonde Redhead got lost; unsure if their early mixes were going in the right direction the band brought in famed alterna-rock producer Alan Moulder (U2, Depeche Mode, My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins) for a tune-up.Whether the Pace twins-- Amedeo (voice-guitars) and Simone (drums)-- and foxy frontwoman Kazu Makino (voice-guitars) were already drifting toward overblown production before Moulder's involvement is unclear, but the producer's paws are everywhere. Take, for example, the title track ""23"" where seriously My Bloody Valentine–jonesing guitars and hypno whatzits whirl around Kazu's eyes-wide-shut ethereal unintelligible words, sounding like the coolest new shoegaze band on the block, but not the quirky subtle architects of wistfullness we've come to know and love. Another mistep would be ""The Dress"", where traceable stains of previous BR dance-y hanky panky (such as Lemon's ""This Is Not"") gets mired in electro keyboard chirps and droning draft-in-the-brain synths. You can't blame a band for trying new things: ""Silently"" sounds like a beach-walking Blondie track with girl-group harmonies; ""Publisher"" takes a Police-like drum attack and the trio's trademark minor-chord guitar lines but pads them with odd electronica effluvium; and ""Top Ranking"" smooshes J-pop cutesiness against Tropicalia breeziness. And then there's ""Heroine"", with its honey-I-shrunk-Kazu-into-a-Buggles-song samba. Innovative? Sure, but when all the day-glo splatters, candy-coated swooshes, and chocolate waterfalls obscure the individualized songs underneath, what's the point? 23 coulda/shoulda been the album where Blonde Redhead added on that much needed new wing to their mansion of moody cool craftsmanship. But instead, constructed right in front, blocking the entire view of the ornate and majestic building they took over 13 years to build, is a garish warbly and weird Frank Gehry-esque monstrosity."

Over time her work has become clearer, and the darkly hypnotic Overdue, her fourth full-length, is the most direct, immediate record she’s made.","Haley Fohr knows how to dirge. There’s usually some darkness in the music she makes as Circuit Des Yeux, and often a lot of it. Drop your needle anywhere within her discography and even the most upbeat songs sound deadly serious. Her early records sometimes distanced that somber tone with thick distortion or hissy echo, which added mystery. But over time her work has become clearer, and Overdue, her fourth full-length, is the most direct, immediate record she’s made. It’s also her best.That’s because increased clarity reveals how many ways Fohr can hit the same emotional target. There’s variety in the instrumentation: dramatic, string-like synths, bittersweet acoustic strums, grinding electric guitars, and all kinds of rhythmic foundations. There’s also variety in her voice, which echoes the melancholy warble of Antony, the goth-howl of Diamanda Galás, and the chilly authority of Nico. But she also has a unique way of turning every phrase dark. It’s hard to imagine anyone else making a casual line like “rollin’ in my Nova 88” sound so grave.That line shows the variety of lyrical angles Fohr is willing to take, trusting that a committed approach can add weight to any sentiment. She’s right: every couplet and stanza on Overdue is forceful, no matter what Fohr’s singing about. Roughly half the songs are sung in second person, giving them a fateful hue. “When your body leaves you/ You won’t need anything to hold onto,” she sings in “Hegira”, as if she’s a god reporting the future.  The rest use first person, suggesting Fohr’s a victim of the same fate she just foretold. “Who has learned to bleed my innards?/ Who has given me the deepest winters?” she sings in the slow, minimal “Acarina”, over music that sounds like Body/Head covering Low. Those and many of Fohr’s words dodge literal interpretation, dislocated from whatever specific scenarios inspired them. But there is one couplet that seems like a clear statement of intent: “If the truth sets you free/ I’d rather be living in my dreams.”Each song on Overdue feels like a lived-in dream—not just in its hypnotic, voice-in-head sound, but also in the way Fohr builds atmosphere like a sonic set designer. Gradually, details accumulate and an internal logic takes over. Sometimes this comes from simple increases in activity, as instruments rise toward mutual climaxes. But in other spots the ascent is sneakier, taking you places before you know it. Take “Bud & Gin”, whose folky lilt feels repetitive, but eventually—with the help of Fohr’s ambient moans—traverses a range of moods. At the end, she literally rewinds the song, as if she’s become so caught up in it that the only way to find her footing is to retrace her steps.Such wanderings may make Overdue sound like heavy going, and certainly much of it is. But Fohr puts so much power behind her music that following her into the emotional depths can be intoxicating, and even life-affirming. After all, one of the best things art can do is make you feel something, whatever that something may be. On Overdue, Haley Fohr is more than up to that task."

Probably not you, but “you,” as in the subject pronoun, present on all 10 songs of Practice, the debut album from Jensen’s indie-folk project Free Range. Jensen is an 18-year-old songwriter venturing into warmly lit acoustic territory after spending their adolescence exploring the electric guitar and fronting a rock band. With Free Range, they’ve created an outlet for looking inward, a space to reflect and digest after closing the book on childhood. When they take inventory of everything that’s changing around them, it’s enough to start furiously purging thoughts through the pen, but for Jensen—whether the subject is a friend, a family member, a former or present partner, or anything in between—there is no sufficient self-reflection without a whole lot of “you.”There’s a real sun-setting-on-summer picture that comes into focus as Practice unfurls. Jensen sounds like the high school graduate who didn’t graduate so much as survive, with joviality all but flattened and self-assurance just starting to crystallize. The shift from electric to acoustic makes sense for a songwriter who also seems to be discovering that it’s easier to find footing in peace and quiet: “I asked if we could go up to the countryside/Where I could feel time,” Jensen sings on “Free Range,” a slowly ascending mountain hike of a song that exemplifies the band’s innately unrushed disposition. On Practice, bassist Bailey Minzenberger and drummer and producer Jack Henry handle Jensen’s fragile compositions with appropriately gentle hands, keeping to a softwood framework built from snare brushes and acoustic chords that wouldn’t translate any worse in a living room than on a stage.Jensen’s voice stays in a mid-range octave with a slightly wounded creakiness. When the band finds its own character, as they do on “Free Range” and the slide-guitar-touched opener “Want to Know,” an alchemy occurs that emboldens Jensen, their openness inspiring the supporting players to open their own doors as well. But when the arrangements are more formulaic, such as on the rocking-chair-like “For Me to Find,” Jensen seems timid, as if passing the day beneath a comfortable security blanket of folky sounds. Although they don’t often feel particularly complex or ambitious, the song structures tend to serve as soft, functional landing pads for the soul-baring lyrics. They tie together Jensen’s abundant internal monologues and dialogues as a neutral rug might a colorful room.One tune in particular stands clearly above the field. “Growing Away,” which was fittingly the last track that Jensen wrote for the album, is a fine-tuned breakthrough from start to finish, the type of song where you can hear the level-up as it’s happening. Jensen gets as real as ever, reflecting on getting sober and embracing lucidity through the pain of atrophy. The band lifts and illuminates them with precise readings, pulling back at just the right moments to shine more light on the best lines and a perfectly placed electric guitar solo. Every melodic turn is unexpected yet faithful, every rhyme clever without sacrificing sincerity, no crack in Jensen’s voice gratuitous, no harmony unproductive. For Jensen, 90 percent of growing up might be learning how to let go, but if the other 10 percent feels like this, then bring it on."

On that record, he managed to locate a middle ground between Balkan folk, Byzantine religious music, and the breakbeats rattling the trunks of his native Santa Fe. His aesthetic worked best at its extremes: the jittery beats of ""Balkan Lowrider Anthem"" at one pole, the hazy ""Lovely Lovely Love"" at the other. The middle range was pretty but equivocal, and Bethancourt came off like a talented pop musician slightly embarrassed by pop.But whatever obscurity prevailed upon Dance Party in the Balkans disperses on Holiday. It's a collection of chromed synth hymns aimed straight at your pleasure centers, with zero concessions to so-called difficulty. ""Berlin"" announces Bethancourt's newfound clarity and the place that fostered it (he spent six months making the album there): the synths are torqued into gleaming waves, the bassline is glued to the one-beat, and thwacking snares keep dropping in and out so we can relish the surge over and over.The Berlin microsound infiltrates the album only slightly; mostly, it's dominated by slabby 4/4 anthems. The locale's direct influence is more practical-- since Bethancourt had no instruments with him, his use of programmed synths and drums was compulsory. Because things like ukulele and vocals by Trost were added later, they never derail the rock-solid foundations as they sometimes did on the first album. Even the slightest song here, the ambivalently shuffling ""Knorrpromenade"", packs almost as much wallop as Dance Party's most emphatic moments.If Bethancourt's musical style is considerably refined on Holiday, his voice remains its centerpiece. He's still a dead ringer for Condon, although the minimization of folksy idioms helps him forge a more distinct identity of his own. He rolls out chorus after wafting chorus, harmonizing with his natural voice through a vocoder, thereby lending it a serrated edge. These are the kinds of songs that are impossible to sing without your eyes prayerfully closed, and Bethancourt's earnestness helps to sell his goofy lyrics about speed boats to heaven (on the splashy electro-pop nursery rhyme of the same name, an album highlight) and girls dying in his arms (on the percolating-then-gushing ""Highlander Pt. 1"", a hammy tragi-romantic duet with Trost).Bethancourt likes to establish punchy patterns and flog them for all they're worth. The second part of ""Highlander"" brings in a new lyrical motif-- ""I don't want to live forever,"" he sings, rising and falling over each word-- but mostly sticks to reshuffling the scudding bass line, fizzy snares, and synth loops of its predecessor. The first two parts of ""Streetgang"" tinker with a buzzy theme that gains a powerful thrust with the introduction of trills and glossy chords in the song's third part. You can feel Bethancourt's enthusiasm, how he likes the parts so much he wants to see how they fit together in every possible permutation. Given the seductive simplicity of his loops, that enthusiasm is easy to share.Holiday would be a fine album at any moment, but it seems especially timely right now. Let's take a quick inventory: The contours are stark and sleek, and it burns with a weirdly cold heat. The production is elaborate in a streamlined way, the melodies infectious. A sentimental digi-crooner is orbited by hums and blips, as if rendering your voice and music robotic gives you carte blanche to be messily human, even maudlin. Sound familiar? Suddenly, and just in time for the holidays, it's as if indie pop fans immune to the charms of Kanye West have an 808's and Heartbreak of their very own."

But just three months after the release of the Pulsing EP, Barfod is back with a proper follow-up to his 2012 debut Salton Sea, and the title of his new record, Love Me, seems like a bit of a laugh on Barfod’s part. Even if you feel the least bit lukewarm about his music, he’ll wear you down with an hour of mild, mid-tempo body music until you grant him your grudging admiration.Pulsing was a stopgap effort where Barfod began to straddle vocal electro-pop and abstract, instrumental fare in equal measure; with Love Me, he devotes an unprecedented amount of his energy to the former realm, realizing his vision with the help of a small group of close collaborators. He's steadily built a diverse personal universe of songwriting partners, guest vocalists, and associates who feature on Love Me: Barfod’s WhoMadeWho bandmate Jeppe Kjellberg, fellow countryman Brian Batz (who records slow, strange dream pop as Sleep Party People), Night Beds' Winston Yellen, New Orleans rapper/singer Pell. The strongest of these collaborations give the album an eclectic, nicely varied feel, especially Yellen's turn on ""Sell You"", which is rendered lonely and distant by way of vocal processing.Barfod’s prinicipal collaborator is Swedish vocalist Nina K, who appeared on Salton Sea highlight “November Skies” and Pulsing’s title track, the latter of which also appears on Love Me. Nina is featured on four of the album’s eleven tracks, all of which can be counted among its finest moments; their chemistry remains palpable, as they’ve learned to strike just the right balance between Barfod’s beat-heavy, rhythmically forward production and the lightness of Nina’s vocals. The moody, string-swooning “Aftermath” sets a new high water mark for their partnership; yearning and raw, it comes off as their own downcast version of Robyn and Kleerup’s masterful “With Every Heartbeat”, still a standard-bearer for heartbroken electro-pop balladry.The success of the non-Nina K collaborations scattered throughout the remainder of Love Me depend on the vocalist: “Bell House” thrives thanks to a alien performance from pop-folk nomad and Here We Go Magic frontman Luke Temple, while back-half features by Kjellberg and Pell sink unmemorably into the morass. One downside to Barfod’s chosen compositional style—tempos that rarely stray from middle-ground territory, standard-issue electronic tones, rhythms that split the difference between organic and machine-based—is that the onus to shape his songs is largely on his collaborators, so when he's not working with Nina K, his hit rate’s more scattershot as a result. Love Me ultimately confirms what we already knew about Barfod’s solo work: he plays well with others, but a greater overall consistency might garner him the love he’s seeking."

Where to go from here? There is one potential last hurrah that could get longstanding fans as excited as they were for the museum shows, albeit one that seems unlikely: a reformation of the ""classic"" Kraftwerk lineup, featuring Hütter, Florian Schneider, Wolfgang Flür, and Karl Bartos. The latter joined the band in the mid 1970s and became much more than a sideman to Hütter and Schneider-- he has songwriting credits on some of the band’s most famous material, including ""The Model"", ""Tour de France"", and ""Computer Love"". A reunion isn't on the cards, but there's little doubt that having Bartos on stage would bring gravitas to the band, even if it had little discernable effect on the music played.Bartos left Kraftwerk in 1990, amid a swirl of rumors that he was unhappy with the slow creative pace they had settled into. But an initial burst of work, notably with Electronic and his own Elektric Music, quickly faded to silence. Off the Record is only the second album he has made under his own name, primarily based around music he recorded long ago, dredged up from the vaults and given a 21st century gleam. Except, much like Kraftwerk's endless retooling of their work for live performance, much of it is firmly lodged in the past. At some point, approximately around the time of Electric Cafe, Kraftwerk stopped feeling like the future, instead morphing into a quaint look back at how they thought the world would be shaped during their 1970s heyday. Off the Record takes a similar approach. Given a chance to take old material and make it new, Bartos simply leaves it suspended in the period, making few notable advances.The record is so bathed in retro that there are direct nods back to some of the Kraftwerk material he worked on. ""Rhythmus"" gives the ""Numbers"" beat a tweak, choosing to set it to a fuller musical backing and some achingly familiar robo-vocals. Bartos is one of the few people allowed to get away with such blatant mirroring of the past, but it's hard to escape the thought that he's done it all before, and better, and with a little more elegance and wit. A case in point: naming a song after the Atomium, a structure built for the 1958 World's Fair, just seems so obviously Kraftwerkian that it's redundant. The best Kraftwerk material was smarter than that; it was about great synth paeans to the German equivalent of Route 66 (""Autobahn""), or looking for beauty in minutiae (""Pocket Calculator""), or celebrating and warning about the onrush of technology (""Computer World""/""Radioactivity"").Perhaps it's unfair to judge Bartos next to the peerless heights his former band reached, but Off the Record clearly has aspirations to orbit exactly the same territory. Its nadir comes in ""The Tuning of the World"", a horribly clunky piece of auto-tuned sermonizing in which Bartos outlines his outlook on life. Elsewhere, there are attempts at updating some of the source material, but even that sounds decades behind; ""International Velvet"" resembles Air circa Moon Safari, while ""Hausmusik"" is a strange deviation into the light pop intonations of The The's ""This is the Day"". It's all impeccably executed and precisely arranged, as you'd expect from someone with Bartos's pedigree. But nothing here feels essential in the way that, say, Can's The Lost Tapes did. Instead, there are hints at the reasoning behind Kraftwerk's creative silence. Hütter may have endlessly spun his wheels, but at least he had the foresight to not tarnish his reputation by rehashing inferior material."

And like those producers, Lotic has moved from a tight focus on the more formal aspects of their music—the serrated edges of a given synthesizer patch or the structure of a mangled club beat—to a broader, more comprehensive look at narrative and affect. Made during a period of instability and homelessness, Power, their debut album, weaves Lotic’s voice into the palette established by 2015’s Heterocetera and Agitations EPs. Those records were certainly evocative, both in their jagged, glitching sounds and in track titles like “Trauma” and “Slay,” but they felt like they were hinting at a thematic core that never fully surfaced. There’s a difference between making music around yourself and making music about yourself. On Power, Lotic gets personal.The nameless weight that stalked Heterocetera and Agitations lets up somewhat on Power. Lotic’s voice—most often presented as a whisper or a murmur, more a rhythmic tool than a vehicle for melody—cuts through the tension inherent to their production style. Hearing a flurry of hi-hats and the growl of a square-wave synth can be alienating, albeit thrilling, without an explicitly human element to latch onto; by lacing the voice into their work, Lotic offers a hand to the listener, as if saying, “I’m here with you.” Some of the most fascinating moments on Power arise when Lotic’s voice comprises the song’s backbone. A repeated vocal measure begins “Hunted,” and it sets the tempo for the big band beat that later stomps in. The voice is not the accessory, rather it’s the director of the action; the words Lotic says don’t merely glance off the instrumentation, they invite the drum rolls and queasy synth lines to keep pace with their urgency.“Brown skin, masculine frame/Head’s a target/Acting real feminine/Make ’em vomit,” Lotic whispers, caught in the uncanny space between feeling in control of their presence and being acutely aware that their existence as a black transfeminine person puts them in danger. They collapse the word “masculine” to the space of a single syllable, then elongate “feminine” as if it’s something they’re showing off for a crowd. Around their words, the percussion veers between threatening and celebratory, as the experience of moving through the world as a trans person often is, simultaneously. There is so much joy in manifesting as you really are, and then there is the world."

First, bassist Matt Borlik petered out shortly after 2000's debut No Kill No Beep Beep, forcing D.C.'s great new punk band into an infinitely more limited guitar/guitar/drum configuration. As it happens, the Chinese character for ""crisis"" means both ""danger"" and ""opportunity,"" and Q & Not U strong-armed this potential setback into a chance for growth. Guitarist/frontmen Chris Richards and Harris Klahr re-centered the band's dynamics, keeping the strings high and shooting the vocals up into the falsetto range, drummer John Davis traded brute Dischord energy for smaller, cleaner fills, and by 2002's sophomore follow-up Different Damage, Q & Not U relied more noticeably on melody to foot the bill for their high-octane rock numbers.In Spring 2003, Davis hurt his right foot-- his kickdrum foot-- playing hockey. So Q & Not U essentially lost what remained of their rhythm section, and were forced to cancel the remainder of their tour while Davis recovered. Fortunately, drummers tend to tough it out when shit goes horribly wrong (e.g. Rick Allen's missing arm or Keith Moon's broken body), and Davis took up the task of adapting his playing style to sidestep his critical injury. He healed enough to command the pointedly drum-heavy X-Polynation EP in late 2003, but a year later, something stuck from his days with his kick in a cast.On Power, Davis lays way back in the cut, keeping the math-rock runs to single digits and on some tracks sitting out entirely. So the ""new"" Q & Not U hardly sounds like a baby Fugazi-- they've different-damaged Different Damage, trading up its last few yelps for some supremely delicate melodies and dangerously nude a cappella falsetto. Power is, to say the least, hardly the collection of hard rockers that No Kill and Different Damage were. But with its lilt melodies, Davis' downplayed role, and the band's admission that, hey, a bassline here or there couldn't hurt, Power boasts a cohesion and distinct identity missing from Q & Not U's two previous albums.Like ""Soft Pyramids"" does for Different Damage, ""Wonderful People"" lays out the extent of Q & Not U's new musical agenda. Melodies will keep their color, drums will switch the TI-83 herky-jerks with sliderule austere, and fat synthesized basslines will slink under chicken-scratch guitars and brilliant hooks (""Water softly running, running"" is an early highlight). Richards and Klahr's pasty-funk falsetto keeps the song fun and buoyant, and the extra room in the mix lets the band's straight-ahead thump blight the bright lights."

In between, there's plenty of swaggering and stomping about, with big-reverb cowpunk like ""Bible Cyst"" and ""Where's the Devil...When You Need Him?"" rubbing up against the ramshackle acoustic waltz ballad ""The Pony to Bet On"" and distorted hard rock(abilly) numbers like ""Cussin' in Tongues"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson/Willie Dixon cover ""Help Me"".

Wilkes lets loose on the thing like an Old Western mob on a prisoner.Believe is the second album from the Shack-Shakers (they had the gall to name the first one Cock-a-Doodle-Don't), and by the sound of things they've grown quite comfortable with their spiritually ambiguous ways and more importantly with their brand of wild, raving psychobilly. I actually wish they'd extended the klezmer tip through the whole album, because it's their most interesting card to play, but the chicken shack rock they came up with instead is full of enough piss and vinegar for a plenty good time."

This could be his best solo LP yet.","The changes in a single Jason Urick track are gradual and sometimes imperceptible. But his musical development across records he's made for Thrill Jockey since his band Wzt Hearts broke up is clear. Husbands, from 2009, offered mostly thick drones, suggesting a digital take on Spacemen 3's further-out meditations. Dub-inflected loops lurked beneath the drones on 2010's Fussing & Fighting 12"". Now, on his best effort yet, I Love You, Urick's dub obsessions have moved to the front of the room.Urick hasn't abandoned drone-- layers of noise and columns of sound remain primary colors in his palette. But what sticks strongest in memory after I Love You flows through your ears are the hypnotic cycles of bass, beat, and melody. Think of drone as the light Urick shines on his loops, or the water he sprays on them: The sheen makes them glisten and thicken as they slowly gain texture, but they hold up through the noise, rarely burning out or washing away under the busy sonics.The clearest and perhaps catchiest example is I Love You's middle track, ""Ageless Isms"". It opens with a reggae hook, which Urick douses in brittle screech, warps with wavy noise, and stretches with phases that seem to stop time. All of these moves make the song radiate, even as the original hook gets cut until it bleeds. By the end, that hook is no longer prominent, but its ghost persists like a shadow stretching past the horizon.Such morphing is perhaps what Urick means when he explains how the album title (taken from a film about a man obsessed with a talking keychain that says ""I love you"" incessantly) became a personal mantra. ""[I kept] running the phrase over and over in my head,"" he says in press materials, ""until the words started to break down and render the phrase foreign again."" Oddly, the album's most interesting piece, ""Don't Digital"", is its least repetitive. But the way Urick melts all his sounds together, and the hue of Eastern ritual they exude, gives the track a devout feel. It's cyclical in a way that suggests something primal, like the movement of tides or the rotation of the earth.Which makes the cover image of I Love You-- the crystal-clear ""Blue Marble"" shot of the earth from space-- a bit obvious. But Urick seems uninterested in hiding ideas under ironic distance or opaque sonics. As complex and dense as these five songs can be, you can always hear everything going on. So even when he closes the record with his thickest cut, ""Syndromes"", there's a clear vision that's apparent long before his drones shrink down to a lone rhythm. Maybe that's what Urick means by I Love You-- he's too enamored of the sounds he gathers to lock them up in noise."

To his credit, Diplo's always seemed like a genuine, serious student of his favorite sounds, and the tunes have been almost uniformly hot, so it was easy to accept not only an icon-in-her-own-right like M.I.A. but also a savvy chameleon like Santigold and even, to a degree, expertly crass party-starters like Spank Rock.But, I suppose, a line must be drawn in the sand, and thrusting her crotch in the air obliviously on the wrong side of the divide is Amanda Blank. She's no Maya or Santi for sure, but vitriol against the girl has been especially intense considering that up until now she'd been on only a couple of mixtapes and on one track from Spank Rock's debut. Perhaps some of the extra-forceful disdain is owing to the fact that Blank sort of feels like the last bulwark between some imagined indie community of shared self-awareness and an outright void of crassness. Either she's working too hard to construct a mimetic parody of materialistic fuck-pop, or she's not working hard enough to separate herself from it. Either way, I don't see how you're not better off listening to Lady Gaga, who at least offers pretty good hooks.A few good hooks, in fact, would go a considerable way toward redeeming Blank's largely forgettable debut, I Love You. Remember, Santigold's eponymous bow certainly didn't blaze any trails either, but it was chock full of irresistible, indelible tunes. Not so with Blank, who submits an album that runs a mere 33 minutes and yet still can't manage to outfit it properly, eschewing even the pursuit of catchiness and pop fun in favor of deathly deterministic robo-chants like ""Lemme get some/ You don't want none"" and ""hottest motherfucker on the whole damn block,"" repeated ad nauseum. (Admittedly, ""Big Heavy"" does have a nice Blondie-ish breeze.) The torpor extends to Diplo, Switch, and Blank's other beatminders, who largely recycle well-worn tricks they've ponied up elsewhere, from the skipping vocal samples and dancehall drum fills of ""Something Bigger, Something Better"" to the crunk claps of ""Lemme Get Some"". Only ""DJ"", with its burbling techno groove, really succeeds at wringing something useful from Blank's ""persona,"" evocatively communicating the self-abnegation of loneliness without sounding too much like a Peaches-level lobotomy victim. Of course, it's sandwiched between two tracks that troublingly rely on a beloved 1980s pop classic for much of their juice, Blank's Top Ranking mixtape holdover ""A Love Song"" (interpolating LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"") and I Love You's first single, the pointlessly ""titillating"" ""Might Like You Better"", which cannibalizes Romeo Void's ""Never Say Never"". Keep in mind, to date these are Blank's two best-known songs.Far more apropos is the straight-up cover of Vanity 6's trashy relic, ""Make-Up"", a song penned for the 80s pop tarts by their puppetmaster, Prince. I don't know who's responsible for picking this song for the album, but if it's Blank then I at least ought to tip my cap at her stunningly precise grasp of her own place within the Diploverse."

It is a warm and delicate pop album about life as a young gay man.,"I’m willing to go out on a limb and say that Troye Sivan gets it. The Australian YouTuber-turned-pop star has all the qualifications you’d look for in a modern-day gay icon—a devoted army of long-time fans, elfin features, celebrities and designers on speed dial—and the good sense to recognize how meaningless and outmoded that kind of title is. “I just don’t represent everybody, because I’m extraordinarily lucky,” Sivan told British style magazine Another Man in May. “I come from a middle-class white family in Australia, and all of my dreams have come true by 22. I had the easiest coming out in the world… There are plenty of other people who need to be heard first.”Give him an opportunity, and he’ll happily rattle off the names of other musicians at the vanguard of queer representation: Sam Smith, Halsey, Kehlani, Perfume Genius, Kevin Abstract, Hayley Kiyoko. He invited Kim Petras on tour as an opening act and deftly handled the ensuing backlash over her work with Dr. Luke, making donations to the Ally Coalition and RAINN. His humility would feel performative and cynical if it weren’t so thorough. Blink and you might forget why Sivan is holding court on these topics in the first place: He’s an evolutionary artist, one whose existence and career is the product of decades of baby steps and boundary-pushing. Being gay is an integral and visible part of Sivan’s art, just as much as his voice or his choice of collaborators.Bloom, Sivan’s second studio album, is best described in terms you rarely see associated with male pop stars: delicacy, transparency, and vulnerability. He sings about experiences that are commonplace for young gay men in 2018 but feel totally transgressive in a broader pop context. He wrote opener “Seventeen” about sneaking onto Grindr with a fake ID and hooking up with older men, and the title track captures bottoming for the first time in all of its agony and ecstasy.The subject matter draws headlines, but it’s less revelatory than what’s between the lines. You can feel the power dynamics underpinning each of these songs shifting in unpredictable ways. Sivan starts both “Seventeen” and “Bloom” in a playful mood, teasing his partner, flirting, issuing commands. He’s an object of desire, and that puts him in control. “I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break,” he taunts on “Seventeen.” “Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me.” Just a few seconds later, he’s lost his footing: the older man he’s sought out for a virgin fling might not be so easy to manipulate in the heat of the moment. The “Bloom” pre-chorus is a nervous whimper—“I need you to tell me right before it goes down/Promise me you’ll hold my hand if I get scared now”—just before Sivan relaxes and enjoys the ride."

Legrand's ethereal contralto huffs so much life into her lines that even lyrics that look plain on the page take flight. Throughout, Legrand and Scally sound in perfect sync: his nimble riffs punctuate her long, drawn-out notes to add depth and layered rhythm to the tracks."

But there was a surprise harbinger in that album, a song that my original review actually completely overlooked due to-- or maybe despite-- a stripped-down, ambient eeriness that offset the rest of the album's aggro-beat feel. That song was ""You & Me"", a strikingly delicate yet powerful collaboration with the soft-voiced singer/poet Roger Robinson. And about three months after London Zoo dropped, the creative partnership of Robinson and producer Kevin Martin brought forth a deservedly lauded single under the name King Midas Sound: the ghostly ""Cool Out"", which rivaled the best of Burial when it came to the more desolate corners of dubstep.One year later, ""Cool Out"" has reemerged as the lead track off the first King Midas Sound full-length, and it's retained its impact-- assuming you can refer to the feeling of becoming slowly enveloped in abandoned-high-rise ambiance and serenaded by quivering, sweetly voiced murmurs as an impact. It also stands as one of the highlights of Waiting for You, or at least one of the most chilling moments; the fact that this album can conflate the two is a sure sign of where it's coming from. Every strength this record holds draws off the symbiotic relationship between Martin's beats and Robinson's voice, which adapt to each other in a way that the last two people in a barren environment might. This is dub production rendered as the final reverberations of a deserted cityscape, infused with a crumbling low-end that does for bass what a single fluorescent tube in an underground concrete tunnel does for light. And the voice decorates it like a spiderweb-- fragile in appearance, but structurally resilient enough to hold strong against the rhythm.Robinson's singing sells his idea of zero-gravity lovers' rock like a champ, filling in the evocative cracks that his mostly straightforward lyrics don't do much to cover. The title track's lovesick sentiments are familiar, but there's this pang to his voice-- a bit disbelieving, bitter, hopeful and agonized all at once-- that holds the deeper meaning. And he's just as powerful on the other songs where he's called upon to invoke that lonely brooding atmosphere-- ""One Ting"" (sonically bleaker than the nano-orchestral lavishness of Dabrye's remix from the ""Cool Out"" 12""); the misty-eyed take-me-back begging of ""Darlin'""; ""Meltdown"" and its heavy-sighing pleads for intimacy. Robinson does have an intriguing vocal counterpart on a few tracks in the person of Dokkeki Q member Kiki Hitomi, at her ethereally malicious best on ""Goodbye Girl"" delivering spiteful reprimands and Elvis Costello quotes with a scalpel's agility (""I wish you pain 'til you can't ever feel joy/ I wish you luck with a capital F, boy""). But the more remote and abandoned Robinson's aching voice sounds, the heavier it hits.Not all of Waiting for You has that same ambiance, though it rarely rises above the level of a soft rumble. Martin's production forgoes the stereotypical dubstep war of bassbin attrition to let the beats glow instead of flash, and even when it approaches an actual heavy knock-- like the underwater dancehall bump of ""Outta Space"" or the smothered Mantronix boom-clap of ""I Man""-- it still resembles the starker moments of *Mezzanine-*era Massive Attack more than it does something along the lines of Bug tracks like ""Skeng"" or ""Warning"". Still, a little something is lost when things digress from the cutting isolation that made ""Cool Out"" work, especially when Robinson breaks from his singing to issue scoffing spoken-word holistic reprimands on ""Earth a Kill Ya""-- a decent bit of preaching with a heavy scowl of a beat beneath, but oddly harsh and self-assured on a record that thrives on sounding vulnerable."

Born and raised in New Zealand, the singer decamped to Australia in her late teens, launching the promising Melbourne rock band Teeth & Tongue several years later. Across four albums, Teeth & Tongue pivoted constantly, from snarling Bad Seeds blues to the velvet-gloved rock of Feist to synth-pop so cloying it seemed like a last cynical bid on careerism. After a decade stuck at the precipice of a breakthrough, Cornelius stepped away from Teeth & Tongue in 2017 to record five solo songs, all spare electric strums and soaring vibrato. That EP, Nothing Is Lost, felt at last like Cornelius’ real breakthrough—arching psalms of sadness and disappointment, rendered with the quiver and clarity of Angel Olsen. Her debut LP, the arresting Distance, suggests it was not another phase.Cornelius left Australia in 2018 for Los Angeles, where she began recording Distance in a series of studios with session bands that included members of the War on Drugs, Warpaint, and Woods. She brought her restlessness with her, and it animates these 10 songs, from the way she treats musical inspirations and reference points like quick trysts to her lyrical disinterest in monogamy or the mores of adulthood. In recent years, the tension between being a footloose touring musician and the social pressure to grow up compelled Cornelius to grapple with age and expectation. On Distance, she details difficult situations—miscarriages, breakups, affairs, pep talks for one—with tragicomic candor, looking less for sympathy than a way to work through the mess. “You’re lonely,” she sings at one point. “Oh, but ain’t you livin’?”Slipping in and out of musical guises with preternatural ease, Cornelius remains a chameleonic bandleader, as she was with Teeth & Tongue. She jabs back at some selfish prick with the punchy garage-rock of “Banging My Head” and floats through a languid R&B haze for “Easy for No One,” an ode to not finding some great meaning or purpose in growing up. The muted doo-wop of “Palm Trees” moves on a similar California breeze as Best Coast, a mode tailormade for Cornelius’ questions about what a new state of residence may do for her state of mind.Much of Distance hinges on some version of a rock band—even “Love and Low Self Esteem,” a barbed codependence critique that served as the centerpiece of Cornelius’ EP, gets fitted with walloping drums and howling organs. But Distance’s quiet, spare outlier is one of its most stunning moments. A duet for her wistful nylon-stringed guitar and Mary Lattimore’s pensive harp, “Born Again” conjures the candlelit majesty of Marissa Nadler or even Sandy Denny. Cornelius’ bracing voice suddenly sounds ancient and fading, rendering snapshots of her youth against a backdrop of feeling tired and worn by time. “One of these days, I’m going to be born again,” she briefly taunts, as though ready to maraud in search of lost youth."

It's Marshall 20 years ago, but toward the end of Sun's almost six-year gestation period, she chopped off her hair and looks, once again, like the image in the photo. At the risk of engaging in cheap analysis, this fact feels not entirely trivial. ""When we were teenagers, we wanted to be the sky,"" she sang on her enduringly haunting 1998 record Moon Pix, her voice warbling at that moment as if she were delivering an elegy, like it's a shame we all at some point give up on those lofty and poetically illogical dreams. But Sun is a testament to what happens when that sensibility and logic somehow survive a turbulent adulthood: This, these weather-beaten and irrepressibly hopeful songs all seem to say, is what it sounds like when you still want to be the sky at 40.In just about every way, Sun is a declaration of independence. There are, of course, the biographical facts, the things the record's defiant tone feels like a direct break with-- stage fright, substance abuse, break-ups, creative demons (it's been reported that Marshall scrapped some early demos because a friend told her they sounded too much like her older stuff). It is also the first Cat Power record to feature prominent synthesizers and (occasionally) Auto-Tune, though that doesn't exactly mean it sounds like anything on the radio right now. But you'd get these ideas about autonomy and independence just from perusing the lyric sheet, too. ""I want to live my way of living,"" she chants on the meditative ""Always on My Own"". The next song, ""Real Life"", is about the universality of grass-is-always-greener yearning (""I met a doctor/ He want to be a dancer/ I met a mother/ She want to be alone""). Spinning her years of tour-induced wanderlust into wisdom, Marshall offers them all some sage advice: ""Sometimes you gotta do what you don't wanna do/ To get away with an unordinary life.""In the way it simultaneously embraces darkness and light and exists completely and defiantly outside of any larger musical trends (and clearly operates with no particular fear or hang-ups about kitsch-- check out that eagle sound effect on ""Cherokee""), the closest thing to Sun we've heard this year is probably Fiona Apple's The Idler Wheel. But whereas Apple focuses on the highly idiosyncratic clockwork of her own brain, Marshall is more interested in the ways in which she is, in some fundamental human way, no different from anybody else. In some cases, this means grappling with her own privileges (""Ruin""'s deceivingly upbeat chorus actually goes: ""Bitchin'/ Complainin'/ When some people ain't got shit to eat""). And in others, it means those sorts of bald-faced cosmic statements about mortality that few other artists can pull off (see: a song called ""Human Being"" that goes, ""You got a right to breathe/ You got a right/ You're a human being."") In her recent profile of Marshall, Amanda Petrusich linked Cat Power's songwriting philosophy back to an earlier time when ownership was a much looser concept and all songs were considered public domain. She sees people like this, too, including herself. So in the moments when Sun feels kitschy, it's because it's got a generousness of spirit that's fallen sharply out of fashion at some point, that something about our experience is public and shared, that we're all pretty alike just by virtue of being human."

Spinning her years of tour-induced wanderlust into wisdom, Marshall offers them all some sage advice: ""Sometimes you gotta do what you don't wanna do/ To get away with an unordinary life.""In the way it simultaneously embraces darkness and light and exists completely and defiantly outside of any larger musical trends (and clearly operates with no particular fear or hang-ups about kitsch-- check out that eagle sound effect on ""Cherokee""), the closest thing to Sun we've heard this year is probably Fiona Apple's The Idler Wheel. But whereas Apple focuses on the highly idiosyncratic clockwork of her own brain, Marshall is more interested in the ways in which she is, in some fundamental human way, no different from anybody else. In some cases, this means grappling with her own privileges (""Ruin""'s deceivingly upbeat chorus actually goes: ""Bitchin'/ Complainin'/ When some people ain't got shit to eat""). And in others, it means those sorts of bald-faced cosmic statements about mortality that few other artists can pull off (see: a song called ""Human Being"" that goes, ""You got a right to breathe/ You got a right/ You're a human being."") In her recent profile of Marshall, Amanda Petrusich linked Cat Power's songwriting philosophy back to an earlier time when ownership was a much looser concept and all songs were considered public domain. She sees people like this, too, including herself. So in the moments when Sun feels kitschy, it's because it's got a generousness of spirit that's fallen sharply out of fashion at some point, that something about our experience is public and shared, that we're all pretty alike just by virtue of being human."

If you happen to have tumblesaulted into the world at about the same time, Mondanile's solo wanderings-- already corralled and categorized by some as tropical lo-fi or a part of the memory-mining hypnagogic pop shift-- should represent a deep rabbit hole. Chances are the first impressive pop sounds you (or I) heard as tots in overalls weren't really those of the Beatles being played/shoved down our throats by Mom or Dad. It was the guitar and synth fantasias that breathed life into our modest television diets: commercials, Saturday morning cartoons, NES, or PBS programming like ""Reading Rainbow"". In a way, those were our first music videos. Mondanile's moniker may seem like just a goof on a Disney cartoon of the same name, but it's also a commitment to conjuring images of ""back then,"" whether you're 25 or 45. Landscapes, his latest full-length, might as well soundtrack home movies of Mondanile's youth. On VHS, of course.That should bring you up to speed on what's happening sonically as well. Lo-fi to the core, Ducktails is a close cousin of Real Estate's sun-dappled basement pop (kind of an oxymoron), Mondanile's Deadhead guitar tones carrying over chord for chord. These, however, are largely instrumental jam sessions of a more monastic stripe. As has been the case with his vinyl and cassette-only releases over the past couple of years, Landscapes' setup is ultra-spare: synths, guitar, drum machine. The success and failure of these songs lies not in the hook department but in how well Mondanile is able to harmonize these textures and squeeze them into a pop context, how he's able to convince a listener to smack their own pleasure centers.Opener ""On the Boardwalk"" is a light synth mist that's very much the tone setter for the rest of the record. With the exception of ""Landrunner"", a hairsprayed guitar jam far more forceful than the rest, everything floats by as if on its own weed-fueled current. That's a double-edged blade for sure, and no matter how ridiculously tuneful Mondanile's loop pedaling gets, things get sticky. While ""Deck Observatory"" is the kind of glass-bottomed bathtub zen its title suggests, ""Welcome Home (I'm Back)"" seems to have had its tempo slowed down past the point of deliriously languid and into yawn territory. But Landscapes is rarely anything but engaging. ""Wishes"" in particular is a slacker standout more harmonically rich, more sweetly and appropriately lonesome than anything else here. And if it weren't for the brittle, frequently jazzy guitar licks that braid together Mondanile's key solo in ""Roses"", you'd be listening to music more fit for a Chinese restaurant or Walgreens. Not a layer goes to waste, though. Just before launching into ""Spring"", a slim guitar jam that could easily have been an outtake from the Terror Twilight recording sessions, Mondanile mumbles ""it sounds cool like that."" Indeed. It looks cool, too."

And it ...","On their debut album, Central Falls sounds like another mellow alt-country band that couldn't rock a cradle. And it's frustrating, because Latitude shows potential, not least because of the resumes of the frontmen: Adam Vida plays drums for aggressive art-noise band US Maple, and his brother Ben co-founded post-rock ensemble Town & Country. It's to their credit that they're attempting to expand their horizons with this straight-ahead project, but you'd expect more dynamics and better arrangements. Latitude's consistent, snoozy sound dampens some fine writing, covering up the differences between the songs instead of pushing their strengths.The record lilts like it's going out of style. On ""Zip Codes""-- for just one example-- the gentle cadence of the waltz time guides the quiet, pillow-like guitars and the excessive swell of the pedal steel. Jason Adasiewicz' drums only occasionally knock the songs to life, roughening the sound with the steady thud that opens ""Leave Into"" or the lumbering beat behind ""So Lovely, So Lovely."" At other times, the band goes out of their way to keep the momentum in check. On both ""Travel"" and ""Leave Into,"" they separate a big chorus from a stumbling guitar solo with a space of extreme quiet to make sure they don't build on each other. Was there a baby sleeping nearby?Adam Vida makes an uncomfortable frontman. Though soft and melodic, his vocals aren't expressive: there's an ache in the lyrics that rarely comes out in his voice. He muffles the interpretations, and it wasn't until I looked at the liner notes that I appreciated the bitterness in, say, ""Travel,"" or the themes of distance and the sad, simple images that populate these songs. It's telling that the best cut, ""So Lovely, So Lovely,"" works by using the fatigue in Vida's voice as he switches from a drag-ass frustration with his life (""God damn, it's such a bore"") to the one line of hope (""But so lovely, so lovely are you""). When he hits this chorus-- as with the simple phrase ""between love leaving and seeking"" that sums up ""Travel""-- the song finally gets the punch it deserves.Latitude needs more of that sort of impact. On the album closer, ""Another Perfect Plan,"" Vida never brings out the potential in lines like, ""It's a lie when I deny the lovers on the side/ I never heard about the cancer."" The send-off, ""I should stay out of town and out of touch,"" could be miserable if it didn't disappear into an instrumental section that just sounds like padding; the lead guitar turns to knotty lines behind that final verse, but your ear is no longer looking for it. And ballads like ""Parallel"" and ""Famous Harbor"" are like sinking into the best bed you've ever slept all day in. It's a soothing listen, but I recommend not listening to this while driving or operating heavy machinery."

What is Colundi? Well, it’s kind of hard to say. At its simplest, its advocates explain, it’s an alternative tuning system—“the Colundi Sequence”—that rejects conventional Western tuning in favor of a number of unusual resonant frequencies. Dig through the web pages and internet groups dedicated to its existence, though, and the story rapidly becomes more tangled and unlikely, taking in numerology, mysticism, sacred geometry, and various flavors of woo.It’s probably sensible to take the rhetoric surrounding Colundi with a big pinch of salt, but it’s undeniable that for Perälä, the idea has been galvanizing. In the last year or two, he’s released a startling brace of music through Bandcamp and on a string of friendly labels—and Resonance, his second release for Nina Kraviz’s трип, is a giddy joy. There are echoes of the music that Perälä made for his friend Aphex Twin’s Rephlex Records in the ’00s—obscure IDM releases guided by a misty sense of melody. If those early albums often had a muted or dreamy quality, though, Resonance feels bold and upfront: a journey through beatific techno modes defined by its heady propulsion.A familiar characteristic of IDM is a certain rhythmic fussiness— intricately filleted breakbeats, head-scratching time signatures, disorienting glitches. No such tactics are on display on Resonance. On the contrary, you often get the sense that Perälä is searching for the path of least resistance, hoping to unlock some sort of ecstatic yogic flow. The bulk of the record’s 46 minutes is dominated by a thumping four-on-the-floor kick, but the unrelenting drums are a framework through which Perälä drapes dazzling electronic progressions—glimmering stargazer melodies, growling acid lines, or ringing tones that evoke the holy calm of wind chimes in a rural temple. The result is curiously multifarious: You can easily imagine these tracks dropped deep in the mix at Berghain or Tresor, but they feel equally suited to meditation or contemplation.There are very few dull spots, although the 10 tracks feel very much of a piece, or like variations on a theme. The identikit titling—“UKMH51900039” through to “UKMH51900048”—gives the impression Perälä might have made them in a single sitting, molding them to his secret formula. In interviews, Perälä talks about Colundi as if it holds the answer to life, the universe, and everything in between. But you don’t necessarily have to swallow Colundi to appreciate what he’s doing. The best electronic dance music stirs the soul as well as the body, and Resonance—sparkling, ecstatic, slightly enigmatic—does just that."

Three years later, lead singer Shogun might have worked to temper his powerful soul shout and the production is cleaner, but the songs are just as catchy and full of emotion.","A recent Royal Headache show at the Sydney Opera House got stopped by police. During ""Down the Lane"", fans crashed the stage en masse, and when the chorus hit, they sang it as hard as they could. The scene became more raucous as the band sped into ""Girls"", and that's when cops eventually muscled the crowd off stage. A woman who'd eluded the wall of neon-vested officers took the mic and said, ""I love you, Shogun."" She was speaking to the band's sweaty, shirtless frontman who'd just been singing his heart out, lost somewhere in the mass of bodies.Royal Headache have earned this beer-slinging, shout-along adulation fair and square. The songs of 2012's Royal Headache were catchy, loud, fuzzy, and frantic, and Shogun's voice has absurd range, plenty of force, and soul. It took three years to follow up on this debut, and with High they waste no time charging back in. On opener ""My Own Fantasy"", Shogun belts ""I used to live in a world of rock'n'roll and tons of girls!"" over a chugging, high-power intro. At a glance, it seems he's going through rock-god motions—romanticizing guitar music while extolling the virtues of fucking multiple strangers. Really, though, the song is about that bubble finally bursting—the sudden, cold feeling of loneliness even while fans are singing along and dancing all around you.If there's an underlying sense of dissatisfaction here, it's safe to assume it might have something to do with the band's emotional state over the past year. In one interview, Shogun said he broke the band up due to their ""dysfunctional"" dynamic. (It was later clarified that they weren't breaking up after all.) In a statement, he said the whole album is ""about someone I don't see anymore."" The open wounds of relationship turmoil fuel High. The band are frenzied on ""Need You"", one of the best songs in their repertoire (buoyed significantly by Gabrielle de Giorgio's organ line). It's a song about professing love to no avail and eventually having those feelings decay into fruitless obsession. On ""Another World"", Shogun accuses the person he's with of judging him for superficial reasons. Both songs are as melodic and upbeat as anything on their debut.Shogun labors over his vocals in the recording process, and his care shows. He could easily soul-scream all over the place, but instead he holds off on the high notes until the perfect moment comes around. He simmers calmly while addressing someone running scared from new love on ""Wouldn't You Know"". He's dismissive and contemptuous on ""Garbage"". When he does let loose, it's almost disorienting. He belts over and over during ""Love Her If I Tried"", and just when he appears to be going at full power, he seems to momentarily unhinge his jaw for one enormous, cathartic high note.They still thrive on adrenaline and huge sing-along choruses, and ""High"" and ""Electric Shock"" deliver the dependable goods. They're not just going through the motions, though. ""Carolina"", with its acoustic underpinnings, is a surprisingly pastoral plea. The hook is indelible, stirring memories of other people singing the words ""sweet Caroline"". As ever, it's catchy and full of emotion. Royal Headache have taken steps forward since their last album—they’ve cleaned up their production and diversified their songwriting. Ultimately, though, the important bits are intact: the passion, the power, and the hooks that demand being shouted joyfully."

Jay Dee asks on the ""The Mission"", a standout track on his new collaboration with ultra-prolific producer Otis Jackson, Jr. (aka Madlib). It's not so much a hard-fast rule as it is an unfortunate trend that producers rarely get in front of a mic-- producers like Kanye West and El-P have frequently proven themselves capable of holding their own with heavyweight emcee. Fortunately, these two haven't had much trouble making time for rhymes: Jay Dee's appeared prominently with Slum Village on 2000's Fantastic Vol. II and solo on the 2001 BBE release of Welcome 2 Detroit, while Madlib has put down lyrics with the legendary Oxnard, California-based underground collective Lootpack and on his own solo records as himself (this year's Blue Note-sampling Shades of Blue) and Quasimoto (2001's The Unseen). The concept behind the Jaylib project, then, seems a logical conclusion: each provide beats for the other's rhymes.As expected, Champion Sound is unquestionably one of the most exciting and inventive hip-hop productions this year: Jay Dee's characteristically bass-heavy breaks and Madlib's wonderfully off-kilter quasi-organic dutchery compliment each other perfectly, and their best moments here easily rank among their personal highs. But call it a self-fulfilling prophecy: the lyrics are its Achilles' heel. Jay Dee and Madlib change places with each successive track, but their message-- mostly that ""Jay Dee and Madlib are collabin',"" that they ""are in this mothafucka,"" and ""live bitches is what [we] need""-- rarely butterflies into much else.Fortunately, the record's focus doesn't rest on its lyrics: Madlib-produced ""McNasty Filth"" assume's the role of party track and just kills, alternately flaunting organ and baritone sax drones before upshifting into some vaguely Prefusian cut-ups and a hi-hat's violent treble attacks. Title-track ""Champion Sound"", also produced by Madlib, comes peppered with ample fuzz and an offbeat chorus of ""Wah!"" while orbiting a sultry female vocal sample. ""Strip Club"" is the album's most amusing track, a quirky steel drum sample reminiscent of Super Mario 2 backing a brilliant dialogue between the duo in which Quasimoto plays a stripper offering deeper intimacy: ""I can touch you and you can touch me.""Three ""The"" tracks-- single ""The Red"", B-side ""The Official"", and above-mentioned ""The Mission""-- make for Champion Sound's best moments. Pulling no punches, ""The Red"" packs a spooky piano vamp and female chorus sample into a characteristically minimal Jay Dee backbeat, over which Madlib throws out a host of shoutouts and the occasional Quasimoto-ism. Madlib's muted trumpets on ""The Official"" recall Miles Davis' late 50s work with Gil Evans (particularly Miles Ahead or 1960's Sketches of Spain), and its understatement is answered in opposite by the fast-paced sampling, boastful string vamp and Philly soul-style horns of ""The Mission"".If there were a scorecard for Champion Sound, Madlib would undoubtedly receive higher marks than J Dilla on both sides of the beat, but both far exceed the buffoonery of guest rapper Talib Kweli on ""Raw Shit"", the album's abysmal low-point. Lazy production, lame tropes like, ""Everybody say I love/ That bullshit/ I like it/ I love it,"" and, ""Everybody just gather 'round / 'Cause all we want to do/ Is get on down,"" and Kweli's incongruously deadpan delivery make this track pretty much unlistenable. The disjointed ""React"", while interesting, becomes grating before it finally closes out, and Madlib's initially promising revolver-like beat on ""Strapped"" is a similar headache. Fortunately, slip-ups like these are few and far between.Champion Sound in theory is a remarkable proposition, and for the most part the Jaylib team deliver the ridiculous beats expected of them while, perhaps ironically, acknowledging in verse the album's lyrical shortcomings. The tracks floating around from the Madvillain sessions, a similar Stones Throw collaboration between MF Doom and Madlib, seem more promising both lyrically and musically, but in the end, Champion Sound is itself certainly no lightweight."

Move D—aka Heidelberg’s David Moufang—is a lesser-known figure in this line of Teutonic dub explorers, working the crossover between dub and house music on tracks like 2006’s “Silk Dub,” and employing subtly shifting repetition, echo, and space to devious effect.The songs on Building Bridges, Moufang’s debut album for Will Saul’s Aus Music, were recorded between 1999 and 2019, and they largely share “Silk Dub”’s mixture of undulating 4/4 beats, echoing effects, and basslines that sit somewhere the funk imperative of disco and the spacey wanderings of dub. Within these limited parameters, however, Moufang manages to wring impressive variation, from the dubbed-out French touch of “Cycles” to “Perpetual State,” where house music is a dilated, glitchy memory found in the suggestion of a drum pattern.It helps that Moufang’s sound is warm and welcoming by nature, a mixture of light melodic touches and gently pulsating drums that reeks of indolence on a sunny day. There is something particularly well rounded about this album—a smoothly tactile quality that glides like well-varnished wood under stockinged feet. Only on the title track, a collaboration with the American house producer Fred P, does this sonic benevolence spill over into something cloying, as a voice makes banal pronouncements about people coming together that end up sounding trite, to the detriment of the crystalline drum production.Luckily, this doesn’t detract too much from an extremely elegant album that makes its mark with whispered tonal shifts rather than bothersome handbrake turns. “Cycles” is a wonderful musical tease, distilling a sense of perpetual motion out of a handful of subtly modulating sonic ideas and a rippling bassline, like peak Motorbass; “One Small Step” (featuring Jonah Sharp and Thomas Fehlmann) is a leisurely paddle of guitar noodle, submersed bass, and percussive sound effects that could soundtrack a dolphin’s waking dream; and “Perpetual State” suggests house music slowly dissolving over a crackling open fire, helped along by a spidery suggestion of melody.This strain of caramel-smooth production has little to do with the raw speaker-rattling sound of classic 1970s dub productions. But what Move D has done, much like Basic Channel, Pole and the Orb before him, owes plenty to the genre's exploration of the spaces between infinite shades of reverb. Building Bridges represents the exquisite suggestion of dub, the airborne arrival of the Jamaican sound upon German shores in a breezy triumph of experimentation.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Edges have been worn off, battles have been won (or forfeited), and the prickly dissatisfaction of youth has given way to a philosophical cultivation of stability. Real life seldom turns out that way, of course. But with age, our impulse to see everything as an all-or-nothing binary means real life’s messy mix of war and peace becomes, at least, embraceable. It’s a familiar perspective for the Dead C. Formed thirty years ago in Dunedin, New Zealand, the trio of Bruce Russell, Michael Morley, and Robbie Yeats has spent the overwhelming majority of their lives carving a cruel, transcendent path through the tangle of the noise-rock underground. Sometimes corrosive, sometimes constructive, the band’s output has remained as steady as it is volatile.*Trouble *is the Dead C’s first full-length since 2013’s Armed Courage, and while the band has only aged three years since then, the accumulated weight of decades is everywhere. That weight, though, is no hindrance. Instead, it’s wielded like an industrial machine on “One,” the first of the album’s five, number-titled tracks. Extrusions of static and microaggressive twitches of dissonance, courtesy of the guitars of Russell and Morley, dot a minefield rife with Yeats’ percussive skitter. Halfway through its twenty-minute sprawl, the song splits open just wide enough to hear Morley’s ghost-moaned vocals, a sound halfway between a mumble and a hymn. Similarly long, “Four” is more taut—a strangulated barrage of wah-pedal feedback washed in jazzy, impressionistic cymbal-work. As it picks up steam, it collapses spectacularly under its own mass.Though Trouble is nimble and fluid, the Dead C draw mainly on the gravity of their years. There’s a mournful air to “Two” after the opening drumbeat crawls to a momentary halt. The guitars helix around a sour melody, curling in the empty space where something used to be. Here, the album’s utilitarian non-titles make sense, as if to avoid conferring any context or intent. Likewise, a vague sense of loss howls through “Three,” which is also the record’s only true interval of fragility; the ten-minute middle of the song lapses into unhinged, human-like cries of confusion, weariness, surrender, and ultimately rage. It’s an uncanny-valley effect that captures a primordial eeriness, ancient and unsettling.“I think of myself as the Jimi Hendrix of no technique,” Russell told *Wire *in a 2013 interview. As self-deprecating as he was, his offhand comment is as true now as it was then. And it applies to the Dead C as a whole. At just over five minutes, “Four” is the briefest track on Trouble, but it’s also the album’s heaviest and most conventionally accessible. Motifs, if not outright riffs, abound; the song’s play of rhythm, texture, and dynamic borders on the metallic. It’s enough to make you imagine the Dead C, men in their fifties, embarking on a new career as a doom band. Not that they’d need to. With Trouble, Russell, Morley, and Yeats have dug one foot deeper into the thick, sludgy, noise-strewn topsoil they’ve long called home. Call it a trench, if you will, but it isn’t is a grave."

This is the quietest record I've heard since Bernhard Günter and Francisco Lopez's hushed microsound works from the turn of the millennium. It is so quiet that you'll need to turn the volume up very, very loud to hear it well, or indeed, at all. In my case, that involves several steps—one volume control on the laptop, one on the audio interface, and one on the DJ mixer that it all runs through on the way to a pair of studio monitors—as well as closing the window in order to shield Drumm's filament-like drones from the rumble of traffic outside. Suffice to say, this is an album that requires some effort, and part of that effort might involve just sitting still.I thought I might get some multi-tasking done—file maintenance, email cleanup, general absent-minded mousing around—while I sat and zoned out to a first run-through of what might be the Chicago noise musician's most ethereal recording since 2009's Imperial Horizon. But I had forgotten about the computer's default alert sounds, and when I went to delete a document, I was startled by the noise that suddenly tore through my speakers—a sound like boots crunching through snow, almost painfully loud. The sound, of course, came not from Drumm's Worse than Burning Offal studios, but from a lab in Cupertino. But it was tempting to imagine that moment of sonic violence as a part of the piece, in a way. Kevin Drumm wants your full attention, and he has mastered Trouble in such a way to practically guarantee it.Another, perhaps better, option is just to leave the album on in the background at a natural, almost inaudible volume, and let it sink in like incense. That's the same line of thinking behind Imperial Horizon's lone, hour-long track ""Just Lay Down and Forget It"", presumably. I can think of few passive listens that might be less taxing than this shimmering, 54-minute piece, divided into two halves and separated by a minute or two of actual, total silence. As far as wallpaper music goes, Brian Eno's Music for Airports scans as a clash of gaudy op-art prints compared to Drumm's almost invisible layer of atmosphere. Still, per the title, Drumm's disappearing act amounts to a kind of uneasy listening, even at an almost imperceptible volume. This is the sound of fingertips slowly tracing crystal rims; of whale song heard from the opposite end of the ocean; of ghost trains braking in the dead of night. It is the sound of mountains slumping and mist settling. Its deathless peal is a dead ringer for the music of the spheres—all that friction, all that reverb, nothing but shivering frequencies, from here to the ends of the known universe. It's the ghostly microwaves of cosmic background radiation.Despite Drumm's noisy reputation, his music can be overwhelmingly sensual even at its loudest. Sheer Hellish Miasma's ""Hitting the Pavement"", for instance, is a full-body rubdown of distortion—part airplane engine, part power sander, yet still, above all, a welcoming embrace. And that goes a thousand-fold for the sublime Trouble, an album that invites you to dive into its clutches with the promise of never hitting bottom. The noise floor is a very, very long way down."

With Trouble, the Amber Papini-led Brooklyn trio make a point of showing their listeners the difference between ""beautiful"" and ""cute.""","It’s sort of disappointing that Camera Obscura’s Tracyanne Campbell never became much of an ""It Girl,"" musically speaking. When Amber Papini surfaced a couple years back with her Brooklyn-based trio Hospitality, it felt like there was another feminine voice working in the same modern-twee vein as Campbell. But it was more than that tidy aesthetic that made Hospitality’s 2012 self-titled debut stand out, so much so that they’ve seemingly abandoned the simplicity on their sophomore LP, Trouble.You can’t blame a band for having aspirations beyond catchy indie-pop about the plight of the 20-something, for moving beyond the lyrical equivalent of the Girls pilot. To be critically applauded for ephemeral toe-tapping must be a frustrating experience for an ex-Ivy Leaguer like Papini; it’s inspired awfully ambitious work in Vampire Weekend, after all. On their debut, however, Hospitality exhibited more cleverness lyrically than cussing over punctuation or chronicling campus life. They were underrated, skill-wise, upon their debut, while simultaneously being touted as a ""band to watch.""The result is a follow-up that makes a point of showing its listeners the difference between ""beautiful"" and ""cute."" There are moments of real beauty on Trouble: A 90-second trumpet feature that soars brightly over an acoustic guitar line that rises and falls visibly like a burly man’s chest (“Sunship”), or the sort of instrumental spawned more by a willingness to let things meander than by technical ability (“Sullivan”). On the latter, cymbals crash as if in slow motion, pianos pipe up at just the right spots, Papini’s voice croons, and guitar lines manifest out of thin air. The whole thing moves in and out as effortlessly as taking a breath, whereas other parts of this album are distinctly not easy. “I Miss Your Bones” recalls the squirmy riffs of Television, and as cool as toughness looks on Hospitality, they’ve only reached that place following extensive live touring as a rock band.There are a few fun, poppier songs here, too. The appropriately-titled “It’s Not Serious” is a welcome respite to the crescendoes and the instrumental wing-spreading abundant on Trouble. Here’s where we get a taste of that Tracyanne Campbell thing, just a hint of life in a time gone by. But unlike Campbell, Papini’s filling in her sharp observations with recycled imagery, singing here of photographs stashed under the mattress and waiting by the telephone for a guy to call. A Brill Building piano line gives the track a sense of time and place, a façade that’s smashed by “Last Words”, a mostly instrumental song more in line with the saxalicious closer on the most recent Bon Iver album than a Phil Spector production. It’s punctuated with 80s-style synths, another prominent addition to Hospitality’s overall sound. Sometimes, like on “Last Words”, it goes a little too far into dated territory, but in general the variety is a welcome addition.Trouble covers a lot of ground musically, moving through decades and subgenres of pop and rock with each track. But those who listen closely will find a few consistent points of imagery that loosely connect the work: locks and keys, bodies of water, and the telephone. These are things that both connect and separate us from those we love, but for Papini, the vulnerability that accompanies either letting people in or falling apart without them is the real takeaway."

Each successive album has propelled him farther along on his journey from Afro-fusion innovator to global pop star. Charting his path from the boisterous pride of 2018’s Outside, his major-label debut, to the regal posturing that frames 2019’s African Giant and then the brash overconfidence of 2020’s Twice as Tall, it was only a matter of time before Burna realized that he no longer had anything to prove.So it’s refreshing to see him put his guard down on Love, Damini. His most personal project to date, the album invites listeners into his chaotic and imperfect inner world. Across a marathon 19 tracks, heartbreak, grief, anxiety, politics, sex, and love all take their places on the stage, to varying effect. The singer’s emotional motivations feel genuine, and his shortcomings movingly human, but they can’t disguise the album’s painful flaws.Never one to shy away from genre leaps, Burna has insisted on labeling his sound Afro-fusion, but he shows his most intriguing vocal and emotional range on productions that more traditionally hew to the modern Afrobeats sound. On “Jagele,” he adopts a strained falsetto to communicate his deep yearning for a love interest who remains just out of reach. On “Whiskey,” he skillfully drops back down an octave, his tone sober and measured, to convey the devastating impact of environmental pollution in his hometown. Elsewhere, on “Science,” over uncharacteristically dark production from Wizkid go-to P2J, Burna Boy leans into the song’s menacing tones with his voice, mimicking an oncoming siren at the end of a twisted tale of seduction.An exceptional host, Burna plays to the strengths of his features, at times letting them steal the show. Victony, of “Holy Father” fame, sounds immaculate on “Different Size,” a doozy of a track that uses an amapiano remix of a Squid Game sound bite (from TikTok, of course) to wax foolishly about surgically enhanced asses. But the clear standout is “Cloak & Dagger,” which brings J Hus out of hibernation to remind us of his endlessly innovative rhyme schemes.After an energizing first half that includes the standout singles “Last Last” and “Kilometre,” the squarely Afrobeats songs start to lose steam dramatically. “Common Person” sounds like a B-rate version of “Dangote,” without the inherent class tension that gave the latter heft. Burna loses all distinguishing features on “Vanilla,” which in its flat repetitiveness feels like Afrobeats on autopilot. When the music video, presented by Ray-Ban and Meta, appeared, I couldn’t help but wonder if the song or the brand deal came first."

It was right after the release of her major-label debut, Aquarius, an ambitious statement of dance pop, experimental R&B, and understated ballads that allowed her personality to shine through it all. Since then, her airy soprano was a proven vessel for Top 40 fodder, and her music videos and live shows revealed a performer in the mold of pop music’s greats, some of whom have gone on to tacitly acknowledge her as such. Joyride, then, would ideally nudge Tinashe closer toward becoming the household name that her unflappable single “2 On” and her telegenic charm all but fated her to be.And yet. Following an elongated stretch of PR nightmares, canceled tours, and a stopgap companion mixtape, Joyride arrives with less than half of the seven singles released in promotion for it. This is a partial blessing—a clean slate was necessary after misfires like the grossly misjudged Chris Brown feature “Player,” or last year’s stilted and label-mandated pop ballad “Flame.” But in keeping with its confused rollout, Joyride stands as a fragmented vision of Tinashe’s talents, roving between forward-thinking R&B, paint-by-number pop, and airless filler with little sense of direction.But this is still a Tinashe album, and those don’t come without some bulletproof bops. She takes center stage on “Ooh La La,” which coasts on a sample of Nelly and Kelly Rowland’s 2002 slow jam “Dilemma.” The track’s recurring squeak of a mattress and bump-and-grind beat make for a breezy, summer-primed R&B sex song that’s among her best. Joyride succeeds elsewhere when it draws from the same hypnagogic R&B that once earned her praise, like on the floaty, seductive “He Don’t Want It” and the So So Def-indebted deep cut “No Contest.”The brooding title track, meanwhile, fleshed out with spacious production and a dramatic strings outro, is one of the most complex arrangements ever to appear on a Tinashe song. It was the impetus for the album—one that Rihanna momentarily purchased as an option for Anti while Joyride was in A&R purgatory. It’s stacked with an all-echoed-vocals chorus, menacingly delivered verses, and cavernous drums, nodding to Kanye’s Yeezus as much as Rihanna’s Rated R. It could have easily set the tone for an album of darkly experimental of pop-R&B, brazen and at the vanguard."

Usually, a delicately-plucked acoustic can be distinguished underneath the dense layers of static. Around 1996, Rachel Brook departed, leaving only Dave Pearce to continue the Flying Saucer Attack legacy. Soon after, Pearce released New Lands, an album similar to its predecessors, but with no real sign of drive or inspiration. Surprisingly, just when it looked as though Flying Saucer Attack had done all they were capable of, the long-awaited Mirror is finally issued, restoring fans' faith in Dave Pearce's ability to record original music.From straight out of left field, Flying Saucer Attack present their best album since 1995's Further. Sonically, it's Pearce's most accessible and melodic record to date, due largely to the fact that the levels seem to be switched-- on most previous outings, atmospheric feedback and buzzing dominated the mix while Dave Pearce sang quietly in the background; on Mirror, it's quite the opposite. Here, the songs are the main focus (as they should be), and the effects are pushed just below the surface.Songwise, though, Pearce is still riding the same wave. His somber acoustic folk still recalls the gentle melancholy of Nick Drake, but for the first time, the melodies and lyrics can actually be clearly deciphered. Of course, the entire album isn't composed of simple folky musings-- that'd be boring! Pearce keeps it varied this time around, implementing actual percussion on a few of the numbers, and being generally inventive. Even when songs run past the eight minute mark, like the beautiful ""Islands,"" they morph through distinct and attention-grabbing phases, beginning sparsely and building into spiraling crescendos of drug-addled bliss.And speaking of drugs, how about that packaging?! Flying Saucer Attack albums have always been easily characterized by their vast stretches of flatland and other places uninhabited by humans. When I first saw the cover of Mirror, I honestly thought I was looking at a Grateful Dead reissue. And in place of liner notes is a blatantly hallucinogenic image of a psychedelic rainbow over a body of water, with creepy mutations of animals splashing about, and warped, gloopy flying saucers zooming past pink clouds. In a time when drugs are so revered by the hipster elite, it's good to see somebody living it up a little.But the cover art isn't all that's changed for Flying Saucer Attack. On Mirror Pearce experiments with new sounds and genres. In between his standard spacy acoustic numbers, he also jumps on the electronic bandwagon (albeit a little late), fusing beats copped from drum-n-bass and hip-hop into the latter sections of the album. Interestingly, the track that benefits most noticeably from the newly-incorporated drum tracks is ""River,"" which employs a basic rock beat that fuels a rare ethereal, distortion-soaked pop song.If you're new to Flying Saucer Attack and are looking for a good introduction to their twisted world of mind-bending space-psych, Mirror is probably the place to start. As I said, it's easily the most accessible of the bunch. Of course, Further is still a more cohesive, better- orchestrated effort. You make the call. I'm just happy the guy's still creative."

Today, we revisit a teenage fever dream, the mainstream pop-punk debut of Avril Lavigne.","Avril Lavigne’s origin story would be the perfect American fairytale if it wasn’t so undeniably Canadian. She grew up in Napanee, Ontario, a small town best known for its proximity to the country’s largest highway and its selection of fine truck stops. She sang Pentecostal hymns in her family’s church and performed in local productions of Godspell and You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown. It was little more than an average, provincial life.When the nearest big-city country station held a singing contest, a 14-year-old Lavigne sent in a tape for a chance to sing with none other than Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop superstar. Lavigne didn’t just acquit herself: She won the damn thing, which meant driving two-plus hours to the nation’s capital and belting Twain’s brassy 1993 hit “What Made You Say That” in front of a packed Ottawa hockey arena. At the time, Lavigne told Twain she wanted to be “a famous singer.”Lavigne had no idea how quickly her dream would come true: Within a few years, she’d be sneering on the cover of Rolling Stone in a black tank top and a curt plaid skirt, winkingly labeled “the Britney slayer.” The onetime country-pop princess who performed hits by Faith Hill and Sarah McLachlan at an early record label audition had become a gleeful anarchist, a pop-punk supernova who skated through videos for hits like “Complicated” and “Sk8er Boi,” causing chaos in ratty T-shirts and neckties. She wasn’t disingenuous or calculating; she was a teenager, one whose formative experiences and changes in taste were taking place while she navigated the expectations that come with a major-label record deal. The reaction between Lavigne’s volatile energy and the music industry’s commercial imperative produced her 2002 debut Let Go, a rebuttal of Spears-Aguilerian pop—overtly sexual, vaguely urban, hyper-processed—churned out by the exact same kind of hit factory. It boasts a handful of genre-changing smashes and mood swings that’d put a high school sophomore to shame.While Lavigne’s ascent from local radio contests to the top of the charts seems rapid in retrospect, her career took shape in fits and starts. Nine months after she appeared on stage with Twain, Cliff Fabri—the manager who shepherded her through the earliest phase of her career—watched her sing country karaoke in a Kingston, Ontario Chapters, the Canadian equivalent of being discovered in a college town’s Barnes & Noble. “I was thinking of her as another Sheryl Crow. They both had the same small-town roots,” Fabri told The New York Times in 2002. “Then I was thinking Fiona Apple, because of her independence. She definitely had attitude. So my line was Sheryl Crow meets Fiona Apple.”"

Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so long outlived their original fifteen minutes?""Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little voice, who never did you no good anyhow. Let Go's only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds. Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny.Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say  the DB's and  The Replacements-- that'll suffice. All well and good, but the band also carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays.Said crimes include:Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"".Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the protagonist listening to Blonde on Blonde in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"".Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?).Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats.But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous ""Treading Water"". Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on Let Go, are gleefully shined into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to ruining albums by both Pavement and Phish.Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps. I'll admit, though: If forced to defend one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought. No, I'm afraid Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with Let Go, and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired."

French psych-pop artist Melody Prochet isn’t a celebrity, but the travails she underwent while finishing her second LP were newsworthy: It ends with a song originally released in 2014. “A million hours of work” went into her sessions with Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, Prochet’s now-ex-boyfriend and the producer on her self-titled 2012 debut. The most distressing setback was a nearly fatal accident that led to a broken vertebra, a brain aneurysm, and an understandably canceled tour. (Prochet has underplayed the incident, allowing only that it “broke a life pattern that didn’t work for me.”) Instead of responding to that turn of events with a cleansing, sober album of plainspoken acoustics, Prochet celebrated her emotional and physical recovery by taking gleeful, blindfolded swings at an overstuffed piñata of psychedelic candy.The sound capitalizes on the strengths of Prochet’s collaborators: Swedish psych fixtures Fredrik Swahn of the Amazing and Reine Fiske of Dungen, as well as Nicholas Allbrook of Australia’s Pond—three artists whose adventures in blissed-out trippiness are only intermittently concerned with structure—served as the record’s musical and spiritual advisers. Opener “Cross My Heart” begins with a 12-string guitar figure that could’ve appeared on any of the above musicians’ releases, or as a continuation of the stylish pop modes on Melody’s Echo Chamber. But, after 30 seconds, the intro gives way to an album’s worth of instruments and production tricks: grainy string sections, close-mic’d drum rolls, twittering flute, double bass, and a breakdown into beatboxing and synthesized record scratching. It’s the raw materials of an Avalanches track and their finished sample collage at the same time.Prochet’s private psychedelic reel toggles between English, French, and Swedish lyrics; analog purism and postmodern pranks; soul-cleansing screams and a spoken-word bit from Allbrook about fucking and shitting himself at the moment of his death. Though the sacred texts it cites fall firmly within the syllabus of the lysergic ’60s and ’70s, Bon Voyage feels more spiritually indebted to the pancultural, track-stuffing maximalism of the late ’90s—sound for sound’s sake, the result of indiscriminately rummaging through heavy deep cuts and easy-listening kitsch alike. The difference is that the irony and detachment that defined that era are absent; while Prochet is content to let her vocals serve as one of the album’s infinite luscious textures, her immediately intelligible lyrics are pull quotes that hint at the central tensions behind Bon Voyage. The paralyzing pain of its backstory coexists with the overwhelming joy of its creation."

It’s her agent. That audition she has? It’s in Hollywood, Florida. Off she goes on a cross-country dance trip to Florida, where she nails her audition for the role of a bug-eyed lobster.This is the beginning of a gag Rose sees all the way through her fourth album, Superstar, which tells the story of a character based off an exaggerated version of herself, mixed with bits of Kanye West and 2007 Britney Spears. This character, or “anti-hero” as Rose often calls them, is a study in contradictions—confident and insecure, anxious and optimistic, ambitious to the point of delusion—who, having recently experienced the rush of success, now craves fame and riches.Looking back, it seems obvious Rose would make such a character-driven album. By the time of her breakout third LP Loner in 2018, she had already started dressing in all red and refining an irreverent onstage persona. Loner was a hybrid offering: Americana-esque stories that played out from multiple perspectives, told through indie-pop melodies that carefully folded in programmatic drums and synthesizers. By contrast, Superstar is a single narrative. Chronological storytelling means the album has only one direction to travel; it’s easy to predict the main character’s impending undoing. Like a book whose author has overcommitted to her outline, the album’s linear structure sacrifices opportunities for spontaneity along the way.Superstar also lacks some of the musical restraint that made Loner such a balanced listen. Armed with new studio tricks and the desire to create something from scratch, Rose played every position—songwriter, producer, engineer, guitarist, flutist, field recording supervisor. While her intentions are admirable, Superstar suffers from an excess of overwrought effects (reverb! panning!) that an outside collaborator might’ve trimmed. Still, when Rose manages to find the right balance on her own, as on lead single “Feel the Way I Want,” it’s clear she’s a fiercely talented artist with omnivorous taste that extends from the hyper-pop of Grimes to the abstract electronic music of Suzanne Ciani. The opening riff of “Back at the Beginning” recalls the wiry guitar solo from Dandy Warhols’ “We Used to Be Friends.” Given her wide range of source material, it’s easy to understand how Rose could struggle in the editing process.What remains strong throughout the album are the lyrics. Rose is an undeniably gifted songwriter, capable of cleverness without sacrificing clarity. Her sense of humor is strong as ever, especially on “Do You Think We’ll Last Forever,” a sparse dance track about new-relationship anxiety. “I’m alright, I’m alright, I’m alright/It’s just a heart attack,” Rose insists. Later, on the standout “Freak Like Me,” she describes the object of her affection as a “split-level home,” a “brick through a broken window,” a “skin-tight suit,” a “vicious dom,” and a “drunk conversation.” Cobbled together, the evocative descriptions reveal a person ready to relish their freakiness in front of a lover who’s equally down.These personal-feeling moments are the album’s strongest, and Superstar could use more of them. By clinging to the never-ending blank page of the bit, Rose winds up in shallower waters. Her previous albums demonstrate her gift for thinking critically about knotty concepts and turning heady observations on subjects like monotony and loneliness into indie-pop gold. Here, each song is a variation on the same ultimate theme: the fine line between aspiration and delusion. And while Rose mines the topic for all it’s worth—exploring the many side-effects and surprises that stem from unchecked ambition—her reluctance to explore perspectives beyond that of her neurotic anti-hero limit the experience.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)"

Three years later, lead singer Shogun might have worked to temper his powerful soul shout and the production is cleaner, but the songs are just as catchy and full of emotion.","A recent Royal Headache show at the Sydney Opera House got stopped by police. During ""Down the Lane"", fans crashed the stage en masse, and when the chorus hit, they sang it as hard as they could. The scene became more raucous as the band sped into ""Girls"", and that's when cops eventually muscled the crowd off stage. A woman who'd eluded the wall of neon-vested officers took the mic and said, ""I love you, Shogun."" She was speaking to the band's sweaty, shirtless frontman who'd just been singing his heart out, lost somewhere in the mass of bodies.Royal Headache have earned this beer-slinging, shout-along adulation fair and square. The songs of 2012's Royal Headache were catchy, loud, fuzzy, and frantic, and Shogun's voice has absurd range, plenty of force, and soul. It took three years to follow up on this debut, and with High they waste no time charging back in. On opener ""My Own Fantasy"", Shogun belts ""I used to live in a world of rock'n'roll and tons of girls!"" over a chugging, high-power intro. At a glance, it seems he's going through rock-god motions—romanticizing guitar music while extolling the virtues of fucking multiple strangers. Really, though, the song is about that bubble finally bursting—the sudden, cold feeling of loneliness even while fans are singing along and dancing all around you.If there's an underlying sense of dissatisfaction here, it's safe to assume it might have something to do with the band's emotional state over the past year. In one interview, Shogun said he broke the band up due to their ""dysfunctional"" dynamic. (It was later clarified that they weren't breaking up after all.) In a statement, he said the whole album is ""about someone I don't see anymore."" The open wounds of relationship turmoil fuel High. The band are frenzied on ""Need You"", one of the best songs in their repertoire (buoyed significantly by Gabrielle de Giorgio's organ line). It's a song about professing love to no avail and eventually having those feelings decay into fruitless obsession. On ""Another World"", Shogun accuses the person he's with of judging him for superficial reasons. Both songs are as melodic and upbeat as anything on their debut.Shogun labors over his vocals in the recording process, and his care shows. He could easily soul-scream all over the place, but instead he holds off on the high notes until the perfect moment comes around. He simmers calmly while addressing someone running scared from new love on ""Wouldn't You Know"". He's dismissive and contemptuous on ""Garbage"". When he does let loose, it's almost disorienting. He belts over and over during ""Love Her If I Tried"", and just when he appears to be going at full power, he seems to momentarily unhinge his jaw for one enormous, cathartic high note.They still thrive on adrenaline and huge sing-along choruses, and ""High"" and ""Electric Shock"" deliver the dependable goods. They're not just going through the motions, though. ""Carolina"", with its acoustic underpinnings, is a surprisingly pastoral plea. The hook is indelible, stirring memories of other people singing the words ""sweet Caroline"". As ever, it's catchy and full of emotion. Royal Headache have taken steps forward since their last album—they’ve cleaned up their production and diversified their songwriting. Ultimately, though, the important bits are intact: the passion, the power, and the hooks that demand being shouted joyfully."

Strand of Oaks, “but I had your sweet tunes to play.” That song, mysteriously titled “JM”, recounts long afternoons spent rebelling against his parents, smoking in his car, hating all his friends, and playing JM’s sweet tunes at presumably high volume. The guitars swell and crash around him, then lumber into the kind of crunchy jam that once upon a time had teenage misfits pumping fists or raising lighters in unison. Given that the song is set in Indiana, JM could conceivably be John Mellencamp, the Hoosier rocker laureate who used to sing about such kids, but in fact Showalter has disclosed the song’s true subject: Jason Molina. “JM” is a moving tale of extreme adolescent alienation, alleviated only by the narrator’s identification with a rock hero, in this case one whose locality as a Midwesterner—and sometime Indianan—makes him all the more relatable, more approachable, more real.“JM” is the lynchpin on Strand of Oaks’ fourth album, HEAL, in that it shows two different versions of Showalter: the angry, potentially violent teen blasting Songs: Ohia and the adult who now knows Molina’s fate. The song’s power lies not only in its barrage of guitars, but in the sad wisdom gleaned from fallen heroes. On all of these songs, Showalter comes across as the kind of character Molina certainly identified with and occasionally wrote about: a blue-collar, dead-end kid with an uncertain future and some darkness in him. HEAL is an album as memoir: stark and at times emotionally harrowing as it recounts with bracing candor the artist’s struggles with friends, family, and most of all himself. The choruses may swoop and soar, the guitars may churn valiantly, but Showalter’s nostalgia for his own past is never rosy. There are still hints of shame and self-loathing in his voice, as though he is still very much the kid he sings about.“Shame” and “self-loathing” are not words often used to describe great rock records—at least not those made outside the 1990s, when personal darkness became rock’s eventually tiresome subject matter. The songs on HEAL, however, are more than just therapy sessions; in fact, they reveal an idiosyncratic artist rummaging through his memories to find the source of his art. Opener “Goshen '97”, named after Showalter’s hometown in the northern part of the state, describes his first stabs at making music, buying beat-up Casios, “singing Pumpkins in the mirror” and finding his dad’s tape machine. The details are so vivid you hardly mind that he tries to sneak the line, “That’s where the magic began,” by you. The song describes a lonely kid finding some comfort in music and some camaraderie in his musical idols, so it’s perfectly apt that guitar hero J Mascis (another JM) shreds his way through “Goshen '97”."

The Hold Steady's Franz Nicolay guests.","Jennifer O'Connor is not an especially glamorous singer or songwriter. She sings in a capably expressive voice and fashions lyrics that sound straightforward at first but reveal tangles of ambiguities on further listening. Her previous albums have all been strong, modest, and memorable, but rarely showy. This is not to discredit O'Connor. Far from a wallflower, she simply has little patience for artifice, the lack of which lends her music the straightforward appeal of many alt-country singers, although there are few genre elements in her indie-folk-rock. Her fourth album, Here With Me, is packed with predictably sturdy guitars and predictably sympathetic vocals, yet there's no sense that her approach is losing any of its vitality.In fact, these songs do what O'Connor's songs always do: They draw you in gradually until you realize the full and intricate implications of a line like ""I won't let you go, I know you think you're safer on your own."" She sings that line on opener ""The Church and the River"", making it unclear if that is a pledge of love, a promise of protection, or a threat. O'Connor savors concrete details for their evocative powers: ""Your jean jacket had a frayed collar on that midnight shopping trip that Christmas Eve,"" she sings on the plaintive ""Valley Road 86"", about an old friend who's no longer around. That's the sort of observation that sets up a short story, but here it's buried deep in the song-- a memory that springs to mind unheeded and possibly unwanted.Despite its overtones of death specifically and loss in general, Here With Me is O'Connor's most hopeful album, reportedly inspired by a happy relationship (which inspired the album cover). ""We've got a lot of time to get this right,"" she sings on the poppy title track, but then qualifies, ""at least that's how I hope it's gonna be."" Most of these songs explore the tenuousness of any romance, an emotional give and take that O'Connor suggests is as devastating as it is rewarding. So when she admits, ""I want you here with me,"" over crescendoing guitars, she sounds breathless yet triumphantly content.Produced by John Agnello, Here With Me features a small roster of musicians, including her regular backing trio, who do a fine job of complementing O'Connor's melodies without intruding on her personal space. On ""Daylight Out"", ""Credit in the Cost"", and the Liz Phair-ish ""Xmas Party"" especially, they sound like a well-seasoned road band playing some club out in America somewhere. Still, despite Hold Steady multi-instrumentalist/mustache aficionado Franz Nicolay adding piano and accordion flourishes, the album can't quite match Over the Mountain, Across the Valley and Back to the Stars for openness and range of sound, although occasionally the band pull off a nice moment of startling invention, such as the way the scribbly guitars align into a dramatic fanfare on ""Landmine"". Ultimately, Here With Me sounds perhaps too stripped-down and murky for the Starbucks set, while naked confessions like ""I want to give myself to you/ I want to give and give and give"" may scare off indie listeners used to a little more emotional distance in their singer-songwriters. It's their loss: In following her muse, O'Connor makes not fitting sound like an incomparable virtue."

As its dimly lit name and colony-of-cobwebs cover suggests, the Boston metal quartet's third album, Shadows, finds them slinking deeper into their molten doom.","Boston quartet Morne has, to date, used its discography like a very public workshop. The band spent the first several years of its existence constructing an elaborate and involved monument of their metallic interests. Their debut, 2009’s Untold Wait, swiveled from lumbering stomp to swooping strings, all during a thesis-like 10-minute opener. Subsequent tracks raced through caustic punk sprints or lurched through swampy mid-tempo charges; they crawled along an elegant doom arc, only to emerge into recalcitrant, noisy rumbles gilded by strings and electronics.If the first four years in the Morne workshop were about building something ornate, however, the last four years have been about not deconstruction so much as simply removing stylistic excess. Morne have attempted to refine the foundation beneath the indulgence. Their debut for Profound Lore, 2011’s Asylum, trimmed much of the up-tempo aggression, ensconcing even their outbursts in sounds that were slower, steadier and heavier. During closer “Volition”, Jarboe added her ghastly coo above weepy piano and strings. In the song’s final third, the delicacy yielded to an incandescent, electric smolder that was at once grim and meticulous. After six years and two albums, Morne had finally arrived at their essence-- a refined and molten sort of doom, capable of sudden and surprising detours.As the dimly lit name and colony-of-cobwebs cover suggests, Shadows, Morne’s third album, slinks deeper into doom. They trim the track list to five songs and stretch three of the numbers beyond the 10-minute mark; for comparison’s sake, Asylum and Untold Wait included seven tracks each and a collective total of only three quadruple-digit running times. Opener “Coming of Winter” begins with a roar of monolithic amplifier consonance, a flood of sound emptying into a void. The motion eventually rises into a half-time charge of seesaw melodies and sandpaper screams, a black mass of stepwise accretion. Indeed, most every piece of Shadows follows this generalized stratagem of starting slow and low but steadily escalating into organized upheaval. “A Distance” first wafts through a web of alien electronics and desolate riffs, anchored by a militaristic drum tromp. But the song’s midsection browbeats with sluggish thrash, a heavyweight attempting to summon a featherweight’s agility. “New Dawn” first feels like an attempt to crush with sheer sonics, with surges of distorted bass collapsing atop circular guitar and a simple drum kit plod; as the track accelerates, however, Morne suggests a refined Dopesmoker, the band orbiting a memorable theme like it’s a mantra. Despite these consistent shifts from near-silence to sizable roar, Shadows’ dynamic range seems nonexistent by album’s end, largely because Morne is incapable of pushing past the mold it has set for itself.  In their quest to define their sound, Morne forgot to allow room for deviation. To wit, the instrumental closer mostly functions as a standard album track only without words. Morne gets trapped by how they hope to sound."

And with good reason. The Glaswegian quartet had been shoved aside by two major labels-- first Geffen, then Sony-- and its longtime UK home, Creation Records, closed up shop entirely in 1999. By the time the group's ninth album, Man Made, finally arrived in 2005-- via the bands' own PeMa Records label in the UK and Merge in the U.S.-- is was noticeably unsettled. Each glistening Byrds-inspired harmony masked lyrics that pondered death, impermanence, and regret. ""There is more to learn than I've aimed for/ So much under the sun I should play for/ Before I'm taken in,"" sang bassist Gerard Love, one of the group's three songwriters, on ""Time Stops"". It was a good record, but coming from a band that built its reputation on sugar sweet power-pop, it was a bit of a downer.Fortunately, Shadows finds the band feeling a bit more hopeful. Album opener ""Sometimes I Don't Need to Believe in Anything"" begins with Love singing about feeling alive and ends with the band skipping through a cascade of angelic da-da-da's. He's not the only one feeling better, either. ""Dark clouds are following you/ But they'll drift away/ I watched the night turning into a day,"" sings guitarist Norman Blake on ""Dark Clouds"".Maybe they've just had more time to relax these days. At Teenage Fanclub's current clip-- two 12-song albums per decade-- the band's three principal songwriters need only crack out 1.7 decent tunes per year. The pressure for forward motion is off, too. Nobody is really looking for the group to undergo a major makeover, just to crank out a few dependable hooks. From that perspective, Shadows is a success. Blake's ""Baby Lee"", with its chiming open chords, is as sturdy a song as the band has ever delivered. Love's contributions are a little more ambitious. The lightly psychedelic ""Into the City"" ebbs and flows through tides of phased guitar into an outro of soaring Beach Boys-worthy harmonies. Guitarist Raymond McGinley closes the album out with the somber country-tinged ""Today Never Ends"".On Man Made, Teenage Fanclub seemed to be suffering a sort of rock'n'roll midlife crisis--grappling with the onset of middle age and wondering if the end was nigh. Five years later, Shadows finds them at ease once again. They're happy enough to kick around three or four chords, looking for new spins on the same songs they've been banging out since their grunge-era classic Bandwagonesque. Like a long-married couple, Teenage Fanclub have given up on surprise in favor of consistency. But that doesn't mean they're miserable."

Her first single, “Don’t Kill My Vibe,” was released in February 2017, and established her as a pop iconoclast: the young woman who (at least according to her oft-told story) left a session with patronizing older male writers to write her own song about how out of touch they were. Her vibe, going by her first single, was a mix of earthiness—the rasped vocals shown off in the relatively naked verses—and machine-honed Scandinavian pop bombast. Since then, it has not been killed so much as flogged by a stream of Spotify bait cut from the same cloth: Island have thrown so many singles at the wall that three from last year aren’t even on Sucker Punch.Hers is one of the most assiduous campaigns in contemporary pop, and yet everything about the PR push insists that Sigrid is not like the other pop stars. She doesn’t wear make-up. She doesn’t do features. She—let me check the notes—got her favorite T-shirt free from a Dutch airline, and she just wants to be free to be herself. In this sense, the 22-year-old Norwegian is exactly like the other pop stars, selling a version of authenticity that is just as constructed as a 63-foot inflatable snake or a dude wearing a giant marshmallow head. It’s “realness” as a shortcut to relatability, a two-dimensional affect that her slick debut album does little to flesh out.Sigrid includes two songs on Sucker Punch that directly address the music industry’s attempts to manipulate her. Alongside “Don’t Kill My Vibe,” which sets the album’s tone of synth-battalion sweetness, there is “Business Dinners,” its slightest and most appealing song. It's a faded tropical postcard decorated with geometric Memphis Group squiggles; SOPHIE kicking back and sipping a piña colada. Lilting and off-kilter, it extracts the essence of Sigrid’s message as if by IV drip: The industry wants her to be “sweeter, better, angel,” “pictures, numbers, figures/Yeah, deeper, smarter,” an astute summary of the contradictions facing young female artists that she kisses off impeccably. “Standing on the shoreline/I just wanna swim and float,” she sings idly, and for a second you’re there with her, watching her long brown hair ripple in the waves. Then those fateful words re-emerge: “And I’m just trying to be me.”If Sucker Punch contained more songs this endearingly weird and casually incisive, there would be a case for Sigrid’s individuality. “Strangers” improves on the “Don’t Kill My Vibe” template, using tiny percussive snags and an icy synth glow in the verses to create an air of genuine desolation. Then it ramps up, via a smartly deployed EDM riser, into a belting chorus that inverts everything that came before: the feverish synth arpeggiations packed tight, her optimism about her poetic attraction to a stranger flipped to cold, hard realism (“We’re falling head over heels for something that ain’t real”). Nearly every other song repeats the formula less effectively, save the piano ballads, which feel more like “Writer in the Dark About How to Write ‘Writer in the Dark.’”"

In 2019, the New Jersey singer-songwriter—who’d been playing gigs in New York for years and had a short-lived stint on The Voice—recorded a fluttering vocal for a royalty-free sample pack that became the backdrop of Flatbush rapper Sleepy Hallow’s inescapable “Deep End Freestyle.” Fousheé didn’t know about the song until it had begun to rack up millions of views. She took to TikTok to identify herself and rally users’ support to secure a feature credit, granting her exposure to a massive new audience, followed by a record deal with RCA. Now Fousheé is taking advantage of the moment on her own terms with time machine, a debut album that flits effortlessly between guitar-based soul, alt-pop, and R&B. Despite some tepid moments, Fousheé’s skillful vocal delivery and coolly collected personality shine through.time machine’s pensive frame of mind comes through in its warm, ever-present lead guitar, whether quietly fingerpicked on the fed-up “I don’t love you no more” or lighting “my slime” with rosy chords. Fousheé picked up the instrument after a recent move to Los Angeles, and it has become a reliable partner for her satiny voice. The delicate “my slime” is an especially striking example, using light-footed acoustic guitar and airy backing vocals to disguise lovelorn turmoil. “I would rather be with no one,” she sings in a heady falsetto, before quickly flipping her line of thought: “You make me want to be with someone.” On “candy grapes,” she and Steve Lacy noodle back and forth for seven and a half minutes. The guitars and vocals are loose and rambling (halfway through a melody, Lacy pauses singing to correct it), and eventually the song drifts into a long, wailing guitar solo beneath Fousheé whistle-tone improvisations. It’s indulgent, but the energy is potent, like peeking into a studio occupied by two talented friends.The album nods to Fousheé’s 1970s and ’80s influences to mixed effect. She delivers a straightforward vocal performance on a cover of Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence,” paying faithful tribute to Martin Gore’s fragility and torment without adding much, either. She interpolates Carole King with more success on “2 L8,” lifting the chorus from “It’s Too Late” before veering between rapped and sung verses of her own over a ping-ponging beat. Here, the nostalgia feels more personal and gratifying, especially in the memorable kiss-offs that dot her lyrics: “For my sanity I’ll never fall in love again,” she raps, with a spiteful shrug. “I changed your name to ‘Don’t pick up the fucking phone again.’”That deft balance between Fousheé’s whispery, enticing flow and her aching falsetto is time machine’s greatest asset. She includes her version of “deep end” early on the album, an extended cut that creates a full song around the hopscotching chorus. Recorded at her home, made of little more than a wobbling beat and a trembling guitar line, “deep end” strips down to focus on her breezy vocal switch-ups. time machine doesn’t always flex that same level of agile melody and clever songwriting, but Fousheé’s clear talent nonetheless makes it worth the trip.Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.

It's serious and earnest, it's occasionally sad, but there is such a beautiful gloss over everything that it sticks, hurts, and feels delicious. Not surprisingly, the album was produced by Spoon's drummer, Jim Eno, who I don't believe puts a stamp on anything; he just added some sort of sealant that keeps the sultry goo of ""Numb"" and sexy-sad lollipops like ""We Can Be Good"" and ""Harder on Me"" in our heads for weeks.Via Audio singer Jessica Martins has a strong, memorable, and pretty much flawless voice, unfettered in reach, with the ability to be an alarming caw (the ravenous climax of bipolar rock/blues number ""Enunciation"") or a silken liqueur (the blues part of ""Enunciation"".) Danny Molad, the mostly-full-time drummer, also sings on much of the album; following up ""Enunciation"" with the duets ""Collaboration"" and ""Hazmat"", we are drawn into a world of thoughts defended or answered by a counterpart of the opposite sex: ""It takes two to turn out/ The lights that shine around us/ Don't you want to try this?/ Darkness won't destroy us"" (""Presents""). Speculation as to the relationships will rivet the listener, but what will hold our attention is the climbs, struts, claps, stops, and restarts that classify one minute of a song as in a completely different mood, key, and rhythm to the next minute. ""Presents"" is rather steady, a smarter version of twee encased in dazzling guitar plucks-- but it's not exempt from a couple of rabid comedowns in between verses.The moody and organic composition of the songs is mimicked in the organization of the album, which, generally speaking, settles into serenades and creeping lullabies in the second half, but never abandons that urge to transform, evolve, and devolve as often as possible. The most immediately gripping tracks are earlier on, especially the opener ""Developing Active People"", which appeared on their self-titled EP in 2004. This may be the quintessential Via Audio track, swooning and rocking in equal measure and knitting Martins' voice neatly in with Molad's. Anyone who has ever heard the Beatles will not be surprised by how the other melodies develop themselves, with more ornate major-minor twists that can be dirty and balladic at once, but what doesn't surprise is pleasing, and what does surprise is addictive."
